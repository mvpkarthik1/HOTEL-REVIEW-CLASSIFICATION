"Over all good experience.  My Special thanks to Narmita for taking care of our In room dining food for her good work and punctual. Then Atul for taking time and assisted me for internet facility. Virender and Welcome assistance staff were courteous and very prompt,  punctual in attending to everything I need. It had a very good experience, food was very nice overall a pleasant stay I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Mumbai  and would like to stay in the heart of the city.  thank you Namrata, Atul, Virender and Welcome assistance team !!"
If you expect Royal Experience then This is not the place. You will see crowd of 200 people waiting for check in. No separate check-in for Palace. Room was ok. Restaurants were over crowded and poor sitting facilities.  You have to wait for 45 minutes for your order! No welcome garlands and drink.  So called Heritage tour is below average with payment! Better you go to Lake Palace Udaipur for Royal Experience.
"My room was sea view, though on a lower floor when I had requested a higher one. The view was great nevertheless. The architect has been somewhat conventional though- the sea view windows should have been floor to ceiling for the best effect. Otherwise the room was great. Room service, House keeping was perfect- as to be expected from the Taj !  Great staff, cheerful and well trained.  Definitely coming back !"
"We were booked at Taj Tower and was upgraded due to being Taj inner Circle member. Thanks for that. Mesmerizing building from inside too. Hospitality in room was out of world experience. When we wanted to make coffee hot water Kettle was licking but the way this was handle by Person on the floor one Mr Rajesh was so well that we never felt like complaining it, and in no time he replaced it and cleaned the mess but prepared coffee for  us, a small gesture but its cooled down us about little mess happened few minutes before. Experience in Sea Lounge in evening and again in morning for breakfast was also very hospitable."
It was just amazing. Went with my family to dine in Indian restaurant. The ambiance and food is just spectacular. I tried broccoli in starter which was mouthwatering and for the main course I had that special pulao which is just out of the world. Special thanks for the chef behind to make such amazing food. It was worth spending out afternoon.   Thank you
The room service could have been faster. not complained at the hotel as i assumed staff would be low owing to COVID. as compared to staff the no of guests were enormous.   Had ordered food in the room as there was a long wait time at the restaurant. Food came on time but the cutlery took 30 mins to come leading to the food becoming cold.
"The room images everywhere including Taj website are incorrect, they have put common pictures and mixed up Taj Club, Luxury Grande, Deluxe rooms. I booked the Taj Club room thinking it will have an extended seating area as on the website images but apparently even a brand like Taj isnt maintaining an updated, exact match of images with room type on their website. Least you could expect. The spread of breakfast is very very small, with handful of options and dont expect much out of it at Sea Lounge. Same goes for High Tea, 5..6 dishes in all and price of a buffet. So make a choice accordingly. View is superb at sea lounge."
"We bought a sea view room at the iconic Taj Mahal Palace and it didn't disappoint! The room was fantastic with highly comfy beds and of course, the food (both breakfast and dinner) was delicious. It was worth every penny we paid."
"It’s not a hotel..it’s a palace..!! Hotel comes with a lot of history..and it’s an experience   1. Wonderful view of Gateway of India 2. A 10 min walk from the beautiful Colaba Causeway.  3. Don’t miss out on a cocktails in Harbor Bar  4. Breakfast at sea lounge is an experience  5. Hotel rooms in palace wings come with old world English architecture and lot of wood work. And the let you open the windows..what a view!!  It visiting Taj, 1N in palace wing is worth the price"
"Extremely comfortable stay. Can't say the same about food. The meal we had at Shamiana, was partly very good and partly nothing to write home about, particularly vegetarian food. If you are interested in art and antiques, it's virtually a treasure trove. Original painting by Amruta Shergil, Self portrait by M F Husain, Ming and Satsuma vases, it's really an art gallery. So go for the experience and stay in sea facing room at old Taj. Nothing can beat it."
"The stay was nice, it was our first at Mumbai. Had really high expectations from Taj Mumbai with its legacy & stories. Although the stay was very nice and comfortable, was very disappointed with the food at Shamiana. And, that night it was my birthday that we were celebrating, so it was a mood spoiler.The hotel was full with a wedding group hence, lot of crowd within the premises. Because of which we avoided many of the common areas. The food at Masala Kraft is really nice, but avoid weekends or during large weddings- the service becomes very slow. Sea lounge is worth visiting with the kind of scenic views it offers. Breakfast spread at Sea lounge is exquisite."
"Taj Mahal Palace is a heritage property and possibly the best hotel I have stayed at in Mumbai. Me and my family frequently visit the place to celebrate our birthday and anniversaries over a stay. The hotel ensures that every single stay is absolutely memorable. I even stayed for 2 nights during the pandemic and I am happy to share that they follow COVID protocols to the last line. The restaurants are exceptional. Though Shamiana isnt as great as it was few years back, Golden Dragon, Masala Kraft and Souk stand out as some of the best fine-dine restaurants.  The palace rooms are very well taken care of as are the tower wing rooms. Service as any Taj is exceptionally personalized!"
Best hospitality ever- it’s truly the feel of home outside of home. The team stretches beyond the norms just to ensure your comfort. Very few hotels show this level of hospitality and are so consistent with it. I could do every staycation here :)
To begin with our Check in experienc was so smooth and the staff so accommodating. We were lucky to get an upgrade to Taj old wing which itself was quite exciting. Impeccable & spacious room with a full view of the swimming pool. A memorable experience. Trust Taj to handle such week end crowds so meticulously. We tasted some delicious food at the Shamiana & a sumptuous breakfast at the Sea lounge.  Our che
Absolutely relaxing. Thoroughly efficient service. A must try experience. One of the best hotels in the world. Egg Benedict cannot be cooked better. Golden Dragon and Wasabi are icons by themselves. Highly recommended.
"Excellency in everything. From check-in till Check-out. The friendly staff will make you feel so good that you would like to extend your stay. During this pandemic time, they followed high level of hygiene to make you feel safe."
"There is no establishment I have witnessed that have empowered their customer facing teams with such humility and grace such as Taj. In particular the staff at Taj Mahal epitomise hospitality. From the point of entry, to check-in, to the restaurants even the concierge the whole system just works. Whats more that everyone is there to make you feel special irrespective of the room category. For example, we struggled to get booking at the Golden Dragon on Valentines Day but the F&B department went out of their way to send us the most amazing Crispy Aromatic Duck (our favourite) in the room as a gesture of goodwill. At breakfast long waits at Shamiana were avoided by giving us a special table at the Sea Lounge. Our car parked through our trip was cleaned every day like it was their"
"The best property in the country, Taj Mahal Palace gave us an experience of a lifetime ! The food was amazing, the room surreal & the swrvice was spot on   Right from the check in, we were made to feel special & the staff was the epitome of efficiency"
My family stay  one night over week end. 11-12JUL. Hotel is very nice. Food is best. early check in was given. Little crowed during week end . Best place during covid time if you want to stay with in city. Mr Raju very nice at restaurant.  Only my family face issue with Extra bed.  We have already confirm extra bed  at the time of booking . But  hotel did not put extra bed in the room . Neither they ask what time you need extra bed . When my wife finally  call  late night around  12am at reception lady inform her that Bed is not available . And hotel is running on full capacity . And cannot arrange the same . Again my wife called and  say its already confirm in the booking then lady at reception has agree to provide bed. And finally around  1am we have manage to get extra bed.
"Everything was perfect except food. Food quality was not up to mark. We were given options for Shamiana, Masala Kraft and Crystal Hall for our dinner. We went to Crystal hall thinking that it is buffet and there will be various options. However, we were disappointed to see that there was no proper starter. Only one item for chicken (Shawarma) which I do not like much. In veg also, only one item. Also, the buffet items did not have very good taste (very ordinary). Deserts were very good.  Except food, everything was good. From check-in to check-out, all was good. Room service and services in restaurants were good."
"Something special abou Taj, it’s hospitality, the comfort, food, always attracts me.. have stayed in a lot of Taj properties and have memorable experiences.It surely stands class apart.One step ahead hospitality, the comfortable environment and the feel like home atmosphere is what make me choose Taj mostly for my stay"
It was an epic birthday at the Taj. Akash the the front desk was brilliant and it just got better from there. Food at Masala craft was good. Dinner at Shamiana was excellent. Breakfast at Sea lounge was great. They got us a lil cake n candle. Would like to come back for every birthday just to revisit Taj unsurpassable class and service.
"Stayed at the place wing with a sea view room. The hotel is bustling and the service is great. Had dinner at Golden Dragon - excellent subtle food. Lovely service by Mr Prakash - a veteran at the hotel. Sea lounge service too was excellent by Baban , Percy etc. All very experienced hands. Jiva spa is probably one of the best in the country / world. Overall great hospitality and signature Taj empathy.   The staff are doing their best under very difficult circumstances. Hospitality under social distancing norms is not easy - so in all fairness one should not be expecting that everything will be like what it used to be. Be patient as everyone is trying their best. "
"Since college days in London, I laid eyes on this property.. and finally this year January I had the opportunity to stay for a day at this prestigious iconic landmark of India. Taj and it's hospitality remains unparalleled and this stay was no different to the ones I experienced at Taj properties in Maldives, London or at the Taj Lands End, Bombay. The staff remain courteous, polite and go above and beyond to accord you a warm stay. The food is amazing and the private yacht to witness the sunset over the Arabian Sea is a must!! I chose the Taj heritage building to stay and I could see the Gateway of India from the bedroom window as I sipped coffee and watched the birds fly over the sea. I truly had an amazing stay and during checkout, I received a gift from Taj - a tiny little"
"It was my marriage anniversary and thought of giving my spouse a great surprise by spending time at the Taj Mahal Palace. It was definitely a great experience for us with the stay at an awesome heritage property, good food (not great though) and historic surroundings to explore.    However, the experience with the Taj staff overall (except Babanji from the Sea Lounge) was below par. We definitely felt we were not valued the way we should have been.  However , would like to appreciate the gesture shown by Mr Baban from Sea Lounge as soon as he came to know we were there for our anniversary.  I didn't find the same being shown by the restaurant managers. These are small but very important gestures to make us feel special on our special day  Overall would definitely recommend this"
"It was a weekend we were wishing would be great in every sense. Unfortunately that wasn't the case at the Taj Mahal. Right from the time it takes to enter the hotel to check in, it was almost an hour when it was done - which meant we by the time we went to the restaurant for lunch, we were told the last order is at 2.45 (and we entered at 2.50), were seated by 3.10-3.15 and finally did get food at 3.45-4.00ish!!!! Such was the chaos and noise, it resembled a third rate restaurant near a railway station (masala craft). The entire lobby, and almost all public spaces of the hotel were like a bus stand, instead of being an oasis of calm, peace and luxury - which its supposed to be. The short staff were barely able to answer queries, offer proper suggestions or guidance, making us"
"You are pampered all the way from the word go as you enter through the doors of this historical & masterpiece property. The food, the services, the facilities all just amaze you. The staff are very, very courteous & helpful. Kudos, keep up the good work."
"We stayed for a day from 1st to 2nd July at the Taj Mahal Palace. Had been to the restaurants earlier but was our first stay and staycation for a special occasion amidst the lockdown. Special thanks to Aashish who helped us from the beginning to check-in our rooms, showing us the different room options and ensuring even one day is spent well. The room was well done and sanitized which is a peace of mind. All staffs wore masks and most guests also wore masks with sanitizers placed everywhere. One of the security staff in a blue jacket was not very courteous and rather rude when my 4yrs old son tried the revolving doors for the second time was not nice. We understand he was doing was not very safe, but there is a polite way to put it across – this was surely disappointing and"
"Had an excellent experience at front desk by well trained staff under the guidance of Duty Manager Rahil.  In sea lounge, Goudy motivated to have more food than average with tasty mouth watering well cooked dishes with best of services by team. I would put it like this that stomach got full but heart was asking for more & more.  Kevin, Kashmira, Gaurav & Mala were always there with smiles to take care, look after & chat like family.  Sumit & Karan were there for taking extra personal care. Rajender kept my home (room) clean & fresh always. Dipesh was more than happy to take care of services & In room dining. A little sweet girl was best in serving room dining orders (I am sorry, I missed her name). A personal note from Mahtaab made the stay more of feeling homely. Frankly"
One of the best hotel in mumbai specially Taj Mahal it’s actually a historical place will definitely recommend to stay at-least once for minimum 2 nights and also try all the restaurants food . Food so tasty yummy and mouthwatering with lots of love and hospitality
"I got the opportunity to stay at the Executive Suite at The Taj Mahal Palace. There wasn't much information or pictures around the web. Let me describe it in one word: exceptional. From the moment of your arrival, from the moment you open your room door and until the moment you leave. The room comes with a free tea package pp at The Sea Lounge which overlooks the sea if that isn't obvious and India Gate. They also come with free two piece garment ironing, basket of fruits daily. They will come and do your room several times a day and prepare it for you, for breakfast, lunch and dinner... You won't even have to figure the curtains or go around the place to do it yourself which is huge.  In my case it came with full boarding of meals from two of the restaurants: Masala Kraft and"
"Came here for a staycation to unwind. Disappointed ever since the checkin. Hotel lobby was looking more like an airport where the flights just got cancelled. My checkin was delayed by 1.5 hours. No water, no refreshments were asked while we were waiting to be checked in. Social distancing norms not followed. Covid appropriate behaviour not followed by the guests and there was no body to reinforce the same. Staff was unable to handle the crowd. Calm place turned into a noisy railway station. Dining area was another noisy place, Manager Gaurav (Leading the f&b) was kind enough to take the feedback and apologise for the chaos. I expect a lot better when it comes to Taj! Place is beautiful, view and rooms were amazing but this time it lacked hospitality."
"I stayed at the Luxury Grande Ocean View room, for my B'day celebration. And it was totally worth it. This is luxury at its best. Also, the breakfast spread at the Sea Lounge was wonderful - one of the best I have had. I will be coming here soon."
Beautiful experience overall !!  Thanks to the manager Ms. Toral . She was wonderful and very supportive  They upgrade us in a suite which was amazing  Masala craft had divine cuisines face_blowing_a_kiss In love with Taj now ...
"My husband and I had an incredible stay at the Taj. The Taj is unparalleled in its hospitality. In today's age, it is nearly impossible to recreate the founder's vision of hospitality. But each of you has kept the vision alive with your passion for your work and attitude. We always felt the warmth, cheerfulness, and positivity with everyone during our stay. There is definitely a lot of hustle behind the calm faces, but never did we get to see it. We always saw calm, smiling and happy faces - faces that were happy to see us and speak with us. They spoke as though we were their family and they are here to take care of us.   May we place our most sincere appreciation for the following members:  Arzaan Billimoria and Rahul - Front Office For the seamless check-in.   Karan Menon,"
Would like to thank the reception staff for helping me out with my extra luggage by providing me with the best posting service through courier company named Sparrow Global Shipping located just behind the hotel providing me with prompt help and amazing service in posting my good to my Country...Thank you
"I love my staycations in Mumbai, I’ve stayed in all the 5-star properties around town except the Taj Mahal Palace. I had to try it out; this was supposed to be a relaxing staycation for my mental well-being. I stayed at this property solo. First of all, even though I booked for the TAJ Mahal Palace, I got a room in the Taj Mahal Towers (the adjoining building). I don’t know if it’s usually like this or I was just unlucky to have a front desk executive who showed absolutely no warmth in welcoming me, he looked overworked and couldn’t care less even though I assume it’s a part of his job to care for the guests? I might be wrong here. The room lacked character, there wasn’t even a painting in the room. Forget about it looking luxurious, it looked and felt like a room in an"
"I’ve always loved Taj and visited the hotel with my grandfather since the 90’s. However, lately I’ve been made to feel extremely unwelcome. They didn’t serve me even a cup of coffee because I walked into sealounge at 4:01 Pm and they said we don’t allow outside guests after 4. They couldn’t even take a minute into consideration. They apparently have a “semi formal” dress code when they serve street food inside which I think is the definition of hypocrisy. Overall, Taj has lost its charm, essence and heritage where once upon a time there was a attitude of “guest is God” and “Never say no to a guest” this has been replaced with “Guest is inconsequential” “feel free to say no to a guest” and “Guest comes last”. The new staff is rude, arrogant and extremely impertinent. Quality of"
"Overall a great experience for a relaxing staycation. Great food, superb room, absolutely five-star experience all the way. We had a great time. Weekends can get a little busy, so if you are looking for a relaxing time, would suggest staying during the week."
"There is a star that sits atop all the other 5 stars in Bombay, and that star is the Taj Palace. The staff are very helpful and go out of their way to accommodate you. If you want to celebrate something amazing here is where you do it"
"Golden memories We are 16 people to stay in Taj Mahal Colaba Mumbai. My friend mansukh karnawat 50th anniversary. Very good ambience Very good food Excellent hospitality Caring staff. It's a lifetime memories stay. Definitely, I suggest my friends, take life time experience here."
"This is my second time staying at the Taj Palace. The first time I stayed here on my wedding night, now I celebrated my wife's birthday here and it was made special and sweeter by the Taj hospitality. The view was outstanding, the comfort of the bed was exquisite and the service was incomparable. Special thanks to Faisal who made it special by helping me decorate the room for my wife as a surprise. The breakfast was outstanding and we felt safe with the sanitisation everywhere. Thanks again for the wonderful Maharaja experience."
"Pre Check In - We booked the Apollo Suite & the voucher had a guaranteed upgrade to a City View Executive Room, so I spoke to the reservation team saying we would like to have a Sea View Room & if possible do upgrade us to any other higher category if available. I was told about a differential tariff charge for a ""guaranteed"" upgrade, but as discussed I never wanted it assured. So then my upgrade become subject to availability on the date of check in. And this was clearly discussed & reconfirmed by me over the phone. Infact even the morning a day prior, I called to asked about an early check in & possibly, I was told the same thing. But to my surprise, late evening on the same day, i.e day prior to my check in, I received saying upgrade is only possible if you pay, so I"
"Dear Sri Rohit Khoslaji,  Hope you’re doing well!   I am writing this email to express my gratitude and appreciation for my recent stay at the Iconic Taj Mahal Palace and Towers, Mumbai.   I was travelling with my wife and son and their cousins and it was their first time visiting this beautiful hotel, to think that this was the first hotel under the Taj Umbella fills my heart with joy because it absolutely lives up to the name of the flagship and is a clear example of if the roots of a tree are strong , other elements flourish.   We were appointed a beautiful room which was extremely well kept and just oozed royalty from all corners.   The cuisines that were prepeared by the chefs were out of this world, we were able to taste Lebanese, Chinese , North Indian cuisine all in one"

They were amazed to see all the preparations and I must say your staff made our wedding"
"There are hotels, there are luxury hotels & then there is Taj Mahal Palace. This 118-year old landmark of Mumbai is without doubt one of the tallest landmarks in the Indian hospitality industry. If you want the finest in luxury & customer service, look no further. We were here for a staycation with family & had a very memorable experience. No words can really be enough to describe the pure magic of “Tajness” and this iconic, historical place. Witness to all major events of the last century & having hosted dignitaries & celebrities from world over, a visit & stay here is definitely recommended.  Staff mention - Louella & Shikha from front desk, Ms Mahtab managing operations. Room suggestions - sea view, 3rd floor & above Others - there is a beautiful poolside area, ideal for"

Have to begin with Mr Rithun Ail who holds the keys to this wonderful world of celebrations & bliss. He makes the whole reservation process seamless  & will always recommend the best for us & surely all the guests.Thank you Rithun.

I would like to thank with gratitude all team members who with smiling eyes have made it possible for us to have had the memorable experience.. absolutely seamless and fabulous!  It's always been and will remain very close to our hearts.
It was a great experience to Taj. We had a wonderful time and especially this seemed like the switch on button to the world that is switched off outside. It was the perfect staycation. The best birthday gift that I could ask for.
"We were welcomed with a very infectious smile by Ganesh from the concierge & had a smooth checkin done by Gaurav. Thanks to Simran for getting us a beautiful delicious cake to celebrate our stay. Sejal from In Room Dining recommended us the Taj Svara which we truly enjoyed. Thanks to Adrian for getting us the dinner on time throughout our stay. The Breakfast Team at Shamiana & Souk - Hriati, Omkar, Faki, Jatin, Esther, Dipali & Eva pampered us with the everything on the table. The chef’s definitely ensured everything tasted to perfection & never disappointed us. Meghraj & his colleagues had our suite spotless all the time.

Check in process was lengthy and even after requesting well in advance for the requirements was made to wait in the lobby and did not get the sea side room at the tower even after making booking for that
Toral at the reception was an absolute delight. I was coordinating with her for my best friends stay who was on his honeymoon.   She was absolutely profession and super helpful she helped me with all the necessary arrangements to be done. Knowing how cranky I am I kept calling her back to back however she remained absolutely poised and kind.... now that’s a mark of a true true Professional  and that’s the least one expects out of taj and it’s representative   Thank you Toral once again for your patience and hospitality ... also a big thank you to the front desk team !!
Hi. I had a great experience staying at Taj mahal during my stay from 21st to 26th. And during the pandemic the service and smoothly everything was working.  Hats of to the working staff as well. Best wishes always 
I didn't like the food at all there... Nobody was there to give us any historic facts about the property... We had to even call at the reception for welcome drink... Dinner was not worth at all. Overall experience was below par
"Hi, Writing this mail with a heart full of gratitude towards the Taj Team. We checked in on the 7th or April for 2 nights and were attended to by Mr.Wasim at the Receptionist whom was extremely Helpful. I definitely will stay at the Taj in my Future Visits. You guys do definitely know how to make People feel special and you guys the best at what you do. Thanking you once again."
"Truly a Memorable and Fabulous stay experience, may be this is what they call the “Tajness” the rooms with good ocean view, the palace services were prompt and everything was taken care of the in room dining food is not the best but good, you can try the sea lounge for some good Indian breakfast and the other in-house restaurant are too good, Mr Arzaan Billimoria and his staff is extremely helpful and knows this work well."
"Stayed in the palace wing, it was a memory of a life time. The rooms are opulent and big. Giving you a true palatial feel.  We also saw the rooms in the Tower wing. They were smaller than any other 5 star hotels.  Each of the restaurants truly live by the theme and are authentic as if you are in that country. Yes, they are expensive but worth experiencing once for sure."
After quiet a long year I could finally be back to my very best hotel in the whole world !  As usual the Taj would surprise me with something even more beautiful and wonderful than last time !!  I always get a special treatment and feel like a week though I don’t know why I deserve this-it is more than lovely!!!  This time again I got a beautiful upgrade to the palace in a fantastic room ... like every time and it’s so magical ..  i feel treated very special every time like a life of a VIP It is also nice that some of the staff even telegnere my face by now n makes me feel familiar to the house .  To be honest TAJ is not comparable to any other 5 star hotel - in comparison to other Hotel of sake category-it should have at least 10 stars - these are my experiences ... from the
"With covid putting a damper on my overseas travel, I decided I nevertheless needed some pampering over spring break, and found it in my own neighborhood here in Mumbai at the Taj Mahal Palace. My room was luxurious, the food was delicious, and my spa experience was extremely relaxing. I think my favorite part was simply sitting on the veranda, overlooking the pool, sipping my mimosa while the huge ceiling fans gently wafted a cooling breeze down on me, as I caught up with my reading. I look forward to my next visit, when I hope to break away from the beauty of the Taj  for half a day and take the ferry to Elephanta island, the embarkation point which is directly (and conveniently!) directly across the street from the Taj."
We checked in to Taj mahal for our Anniversary and this will remain as one of our most memorable day. No words will be able to justify our stay here to describe the beauty of this place. But still will try my best. The palace hotel is indeed a palace with a very rustic look and antiques displayed all over. The wall paintings displayed throughout give a feel of visiting some Art gallery. Room was huge and sea facing. Could see the Gateway from it. Not a spick of dirt or dust anywhere in the entire hotel. Its a heritage property yet has been maintained so well. The staff is extremely courteous. Covid norms were very strictly followed. Everyone was checked for temperatures and the staff wore masks at all times. Food was excellent as well.  The entire feel and experience was very
"Got the opportunity for one night staycation at the palace wing - 5th floor Taj Club Sea View Room. The room was well maintained and clean to high standards. With changing times, they have provided QR scan codes for In-room dining and other experiences. My stay included Sea Lounge access for Breakfast and High Tea. Food was good. Both chefs and F&B servers were polite and attentive. Food was good.  The property does not allow outside food to be ordered. "
"We come back to this hotel every year for business and family pleasure. It’s the highest standard in the hotel industry worldwide. The staff doesn’t know the word “NO” , they only know “YES SIR” and make it happen."
"We visited Taj for the 1st time ever to celebrate out 15th Anniversary and were overwhelmed by the love and hospitality showered upon us during our stay and would always be thankful for the sweet gesture by Taj Management.  We thoroughly enjoyed the multi cuisine buffet at Crystal room, the beautiful fresh breakfast at Seaview lounge and the 3 course meal at Masala Kraft !  Thank you so much Taj for an experience worth the money I spent and hope to return very soon ! Bless you with many more years of success and glory !"
"So me and my wife had been to Taj on 21st Feb 2021 and we were very excited with our stay at THE TAJ MAHAL but right from the moment we entered, the experience was bad. The staff had been either under staff or was quite irritable and something which is very surprising as a customer. We were completely taken aback by the hospitality at the Hotel which has never been in any other Five star property we have ever been. The stay was comfortable and everything else was quite a pleasurable experience but simply unhappy.   Must visit the Taj Second floor where they have all the beautiful pictures right from the year 1904, menu, History of Taj."
The experience of stay was excellent. I would recommend this hotel to my friends. Vegetarian food was very tasty. It also should have a very small museum and library. COVID care was taken properly. Obviously my preference always will be old Taj. 
"A 2 night stay at the Luxury Grande Sea View Room at Taj Mahal Palace Hotel at Mumbai on the 5th Floor was just the perfect setting for our 43rd Wedding Anniversary.   While before checking- in we had enormous doubts about our safety at the hotel during this on-going pandemic but our all fears were allayed once we reached the Hotel and noticed the highest safety norms that were in force with not an iota chance of any infection…….and the safety arrangements made in the hotel were perhaps even better than our own home.  The first interaction with the hotel staff, on arrival, was unlike any other 5 star properties we have encountered till date. The respectfulness, warmth and good manners were found to be ingrained in every individual at every level in the hotel rare to be found. "
"Booked a Luxury Grande Sea View Room in Taj Mahal Palace Hotel Old Heritage Building 5th Floor.  In keeping with the Covid needs, the hotel is ensuring a very strict and fool proof compliance of all Covid precautions norms at every level including the menus which are sanitized on every occasion before handing over to the guests.Hence very safe under the prevalent Covid conditions.  The highlight of the stay was the top class personalised service and care to the extent of pampering during our entire stay not often seen.  Located in the close proximity of commercial hubs like Nariman Point and Ballard Estate, Government Offices, Mumbai Port and Indian Naval facilities.  The room is spacious and well maintained with all modern amenities with good contemporary furniture and"
Taj Mahal palace is giving me a service like we are  king and queen and it’s amazing experience in mumbai for us and we would prefer a friend to go and live in Taj Mahal hotel and experience like a vvip thank u
It was our anniversary stay in the hotel. We have booked a sea facing room with breakfast however hotel upgraded us to a suit which was such an amazing gesture. It was amazing service from Taj staff. They know how to make a customer happy. Keep rocking
"We love the hotel - Taj Mahal Palace when I stay with family. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. Compare to my other travel/ stay, serving partners are very courteous and make stay comfortable and memorable. Keep up the good work....Besides,  Taj Mahal Palace gives an experience of royal stay with taste of Indian authentic food.  Overall- Awesome stay!!"
"We stayed here for a night to celebrate our wedding anniversary.   Taj doesnt have a parking in the same building, they provide valet parking and its parked outside on the roads, which was a surprise for us. Our luggage was sanatised on arrival.   Arrival check in procedure took some time as the reception was busy. Our rooms were together on the 8th floor, however I had the  city view instead of the sea view which was a disappointment, specially because during reservation I was told we will definately look into upgrade, however on arrival the lady just said thats subject to availability, I am bit sure how much would change from reservation to arrival as i had made booking same day morning.   Anyways we didnt bother ourself much with this, our rooms were as expected, the colour"
If there is something better than 5 star then the Taj Mahal Palace would be higher. It sets the benchmark for others to follow.  All the employees went out of their way to make our stay a memorable one.
"One should experience and enjoy the welcome and hospitality of Taj hotels , Only Taj and wah taj crown, my regards to all staff members and management , they are so humble and helpful at any given time .... great OK_hand"
Excellent great experience. All people of Taj were very courteous. Will recommend atleast should stay once in life time in Taj Mahal Mumbai. Never had such experience. Reservations were very simple and friendly.
"Dear team,  First i would like to thanks for giving me opportunity to share my Taj experience. smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes I booked room and prefer to stay at Taj Mahal Hotel Mumbai as i got taj coupons from Corporate.  At the time of check in i have provided taj coupons and had discussion with Shreya she said she is facing technical issue to redeem my voucher and i can come back later to check it.  In the evening i checked with one of male executive for the same to redeem coupons and he said i can use it at the time of check and in no need to worry and enjoy stay.  On the day of check out i had discussion with Shreya, Subhashish for voucher redeem and as per their suggestion i have top up my voucher and was waiting for my new pin however  i haven’t received any mail yet finally i made online payment"
"We visited Souk at Taj Mahal Palace on the occasion of my son’s 12th birthday party. We are based out of Bangalore and considering the COVID travel restrictions we wanted to keep the travel limited to India.  The disappointment first started when we opened the sanitised dish pack. Some sets had napkins missing and some had either fork or spoons missing. Out of 8 of us, may be 3-4 packs had complete set. Then the disappointment continued at every step. With no one ready to take the order. The orders were served at long breaks. One of the order was completely forgotten. Drinks were served after the food was completely over. They had a small surprise cake for my son. They served it while we were about to leave. We couldn’t even enjoy 1/4th of the cake as we were completely full."
This is my birthday week and we stayed at The Taj Mahal Hotel as part of our celebration. It was absolutely amazing. We had a sea facing room with gorgeous view. My partner surprised me with a sunset cruise and it was perfect. We hope to visit again soon and continue the luxury experience. Cheers!!!
in such times ..no social distancing was followed ..lobby was like fish market... restaurants were full ..in house guest were denied tables.. breakfast was below standard... would never come back... they need to work on it
stay was good and got sea view room. the ambience and interior was also good . Did not enjoyed all the services because of covid guidliness. Shamiana and masala kraft food was good. valet parking and security service was also good
"The heritage property looks very beautiful in front of the sea. Rooms are very precious and spacious with amenities.   But 1 thing is very disappointing. I book with meal and time of dinner I was asked for jain food. The duty officer says it fixes the menu cant provide anything else.pouting_face  After this review as per formality, the manager sends a typical response.   ""Dear sir, heartily sorry for the inconvenience caused. Next time when you visit I care for you and ....... Etc.   But whats about my trouble experience? Next time can you provide a free stay or refund my money for my current stay? "
"Amazing place,	 Ambience, staff, location, views, service everything is worth.""  Good Hotel with good resturants-renovated rooms and good facility at an ideal location in Mumbai-convenient for both business as well as leisure travellers. The food and choice of resturants are good. Hotel staff is friendly and courteous."
Our experience can hardly be put into words. Being architects we enjoyed every minute magnificent detail in the architectural design of the hotel. The hospitality was on point. The food was excellent too. Our experience at Taj spelled sheer beauty! <3
"I was at this hotel with my 8 year old daughter for a weekend vacay.   The staff at the property are Great!!!  Starting with Tanweer the guest relations manager and Rithun the sales manager who gave us accurate information, that helped making our journey smoother and wonderful.   At the time of check in, we requested for a sea view which was acknowledged by Piran and his colleague at the front desk. Mahtaab Sidhwa also assisted us and was pleasant and good. They were extremely accommodating and allowed us to check in early.   The room allotted to us had an amazing view.  Exemplary housekeeping.. they would delight you with surprises based on the conversation you’ve with them. The manager got all the valentines stuff and decorated the room. My daughter was overwhelmed and enjoyed"
"We were given dinner coupons. They are taking outside walkin customers too. We got no place to sit in at Masala Craft or Shamiana. Our family had to dine at the ball room which was a bad experience. Its like a marriage hall. We could not sit together as men wanted to drink but ambience was not that great. We complained to the food and beverage manager,he was not very helping, trying to convince us that only ballroom dinner was in the package. While booking your executive Beverly clearly mentioned that lunch or dinner could be had at Masala craft or shamiana. We wasted an hour to request a place to sit for 8 people. After a bad experience next morning post bfast we asked for for a lunch booking at one of the designated restaurants. Reception directed to go see the restaurant."
"Best hotel in the world. Exemplary housekeeping, excellent personal touch. Great food at Masala Kraft. It is the best place to be at if you want to explore the highlights of Mumbai. Front Office staff is amazing too..."
"I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the service and care I received at The Taj Palace from 10.02.2021 to 11.02.2021. I took my wife on our one-day staycation, and I wanted it to be perfect. Your staff did not disappoint me. To name a few Harendra at reception and other support staffs to name few like Suhas, Ashutosh, Prasenjeet, Anselm.  Besides your entire house keeping staff to maintaining the property in spick and span condition. Your security for maintaining safety of guest and all allied staff at every level. Hats off to your team. We are eager to visit again. "
"On arrival without any request they upgrade our room from Tower to Palace and that too in a top category which was a great surprise for us. Apart from that, services, food quality and taste, room size, room view, cleanliness, and every other thing were top notch and top-class. Our honeymoon night spent really well and was most memorable trip. Would definitely visit here again."
"We were not given a sea view, which was disappointing as it was a birthday celebration and we had asked us to be given one. The view we got was not fun for a birthday celebration.  This could have been done better and we would have had a great celebration, if this had happened. "
Was always on my wish list to stay at the Taj palace hotel and they lived to my expectations and beyond. No one can beat the Taj hospitality from the receptionist to the bell boy to the room service its always with a smile. The property is beautiful and cannot be compared to any other. The feeling you get here of being a part of history is an experience by itself. We got upgraded to the suite which was like a one bedroom apartment. Everything was clean and sanitized and their stringent method of covid prevention gave us a feeling of safety. Just loved our stay here. Thank you Taj.
"We had a pleasant valuable time spent. It was a life time experience as this was a memorable gift to my Wife Rexina on our 26th wedding anniversary. Your overall staff was very hospitable, Mr Sandeep Ghuge on the floor from housekeeping gave us extraordinary service and was there till the end to bid farewell to us. We had a wonderful time well spent. "
We stayed in the Spanish Suite. It was the most beautiful suite i ever stayed in (Including venetian suite or any other suite in India or abroad.  The hospitality was excellent. All covid precautions taken. Was a perfect stay. 
"It was short holiday with family. Sea facing Room view was amazing. We stayed in Palace which has retained its old world char, Taj keep up to its own reputation in hospitality and service. Morning Sun rise from the room is mesmerizing."
"It was at midnight on 7th February 2021 I was looking for a room for 3 people, and as we were not allowed to walk in to the reception desk, i was trying contacting taj mahal palace personnel, the lady who attended my call would just redirect me to the Central Reservations without even listening to my whole query. This happend to me thrice it really wasn’t helpful as someone just kept transferring me again and again. After this pathetic response from taj mahal palace, i settled for trident Nariman Point."
"Taj is Taj ( inspite of Covid & it’s issues ) :   but missing the old faces & the exuberance , the class ......looking forward to seeing it back   team is friendly , the property is incomparable , the view is unmatched "
"What do I say and where do I start, but to summarize, it’s an overall 5-star packaged experience. Not going through a 3rd party booking apps helped me gain first hand experience talking directly with the reservation team from Taj (Ms. Shruti Khanna), and to keep the occasion (Dad’s retirement) super special, she helped right from choosing the suite and accommodating as many free upgrades available on a week day.. From Apollo Suite to Executive Suite, From free pick up and drop in a Tata Hexa to a Jaguar, 24 hour stay experience was nothing less than an exotic and exquisite experience. I thank Anshul(travel desk), Pearl (In-house photographer), Mona(Reservations), Duty Manager, Ashfaque(very elegant Chauffer) and the entire crew for making this is memorable experience for life."
Our leisure stay for a day was like a dream came true.sea facing room was nothing like that. Love Taj hotel...hats off to Indian heritage. One should pamper his family at least once in a life time cause ZINDAGI NA MILE DUBARA.!!!
"Had the pleasure to spend my 50th birthday there and the team was just so wonderful, outgoing, friendly, professional. Nothing was left to chance and everything  was well-organized.   We had the pleasure of eating at the Arabic and the Japanese restaurant during our stay and spend some time at the hotel bar - everything was pure perfection!  Highly recommend staying there when in South Mumbai!"
Taj Mahal palace is located in best place staff is very attentive  beautiful  decorated rooms  with new furnishings washroom  were clean excellent  location  food is also good  we don't have any complaints we enjoyed  our one night stay recommend
It's a iconic place with a great hospitality and view. Rooms are lavish and have great ambiance and comfort.front desk is very helpful and you just need minutes to check-in to the property. Only area of improvement is buffet breakfast which was not up to the mark of the Tah
From check into check out everything was an experience to treasure. Room service staffs are so humble and restaurants staffs are so caring that you can't afford to miss to compliment them. In a word Hospitality at its best!
It's iconic place with a great hospitality and levis room with great ambiance and luxury. Front desk is very helpful and ready to serve as soon as you enter the hotel. Only buffet  breakfast is need some improvment( needs to be serve hot). Must visit to enjoy the calm and relax holiday
"We had booked an Apollo suite at the taj mahal tower to celebrate our wedding anniversary .. Our reservation experience with Shruti was excellent, we could feel her wanting us to have the best experience, Our check-in was smooth and instant, and we got a very special upgrade in the Taj Mahal Palace  The Property - Absolutely stunning, takes you back in line, the walk in this heritage hotel is must..  our Room was the Elephanta suite - it is ""what dreams are made off"" (you have to experience it to enjoy it.. our lunch at the Banquets, Dinner at souq (special mention for Sangria & the food), Breakfast at shamiana , and lunch again at Shamiana (again a special mention for excellent food and lavish portions & parvathi) were  very well organized    Extra Covid care taken at every"
"right from the word go, it was an amazing experience. Food/Room/other services were exceptional. The view from the room was amazing. We were treated very well & offered best of the services. Overall, extremely satisfying 24 hours!  Thank you!"
It was excellent stay with Taj Mahal Palace. I had been to Taj in Hyderabad that is Taj Banjara recently but i am more satisfied with Taj Palace. As mentioned earlier Ms Shreya helped me in upgradation of my room.....helped me personally....A staff member like her make the hotel proud and famous. All staff members are very cooperative.
"Value for money, courteous and professional staff always ready to help customers. Maintenance of this 100+ years old heritage property is excellent. It was a pleasure walking around and descending down from the stair case."
"I stayed at the suite for a night on Taj Mahal palace - the room has separate living, dining spaces. It's one of the finest rooms in India designed with intricate planning and rare artefacts. The hotel (though being the oldest) retains its charm. We enjoyed the private dinner at the Queens Room which was beyond our expectations. Overall, we had a wonderful stay"
Taj Mahal Palace landmark historical hotel   of India It's always dream to be there with family  Housekeeping team was wonderful they decorated room and arranged a cake for my daughter's birthday amazing hospitality 
I stayed here for 5 days as I got married at Taj Presidents. Awesome property with awesome sea view. Humble staff and delicious food. The pool side is relaxing the salon staff is friendly too. We booked a suite and it was really posh and best. They offered flower bouquets and cake pastries in the room and red wine too.
we love everything here in this hotel we had lovely stay very good food and helpful people around us we will like it come to this hotel again for more vacation it is the best hotel in India thank you all for making our stay memorable
"A group of our friends were trying to work out what to do for new years, especially given the pendamic and the Curfew. New Years is certainly not a time for being alone and we wanted to be together. We then considered The Taj as an option and having talked to Mehernavaz (the Deputy GM), we all decided to book at the Taj and be together. At the suggestion of Mahtaab (who looked after us during our stay), we booked the Gateway of India Suite with joining rooms and also took the interconnecting room for my younger son.   On arrival we were met by Mahataab and taken to our amazing suite. I had pre-ordered the dinner in consultation with Jezan and Ramneet. Upon being settled in, all of us in turns went to the SPA where we had an amazing massage and everyone was relaxed for the"
I had booked the Hotel for my MD and I have been responsed in very good manner by the Hotel staff. We have been given complimentary late check out. Even Hotel did not charge for the day from the Guest
"I had a family function which was XXLD from Taj Santa Cruz , since the bride had to be quarantined because of travel issues. We had to rebook to Taj Mahal Palace facing Gateway of India , with some rooms and a banquet hall. The place , the price , the positioning , the people are superb. Sarita Singh who was coordinating with me , A special mention , made sure all arrangements were par excellence . On a Sunday she made sure the rooms and function area was ready much before the time we could arrive. The rates , service , drinks , food were matched in our budget. She also connected to the best photographers and  decorators for the function , which was very well arranged. I thank you Sarita ji for your focus and passion on job, you have made Taj proud."
"We had a stopover at Mumbai and went for quiet family lunch. Indian retaurent is very good and was able to make Jain dishes delectably. Ambience of hotel as usual is fantastic. It was very well decked up for Christmas. Staff is very courteous and it's an iconic Taj property, so experience always is superlative. thumbs_up"
As given name palace ..it is actually Palace ..we celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary in TAJ .as our initial booking Was with taj tower but they have given a surprise by offering us a stay with palace property smiling_face_with_halotruly blessed Thank you TAJ 
"Superb hotel with great service. The check-in was very smooth. We got upgraded to Palace, the 115 year old building is quite amazing.    The whole property is well maintained with excellent cleanliness, sanitizers, wipes and safety gear at every place.   The breakfast at Sea Lounge was wonderful experience.   The only thing they need to improve is clarity on the inclusive packages they offer. At the checkout there was confusion which could have been avoided and would have made our trip flawless.     Overall experience was very memorable."
"Right from arrival to departure the stay was well coordinate, synchronized, organized and executed so well that we had a feeling of a Royal with hotel team waiting by our side with a big SMILE. Small gestures matter a lot, and these are the acts that make this team stand apart from other experiences. Right from well set-up room, to personalized photos around the room, celebrations cake, to a very warn hospitality across the length and breath of the property. Delicious cuisine, well sanitized hygiene standards to make us feel extra safe and comfortable in these difficult times of COVID 19. Thanks Team Taj, Special mention of Ms. Mahtaab Sidhwa; Team at Masala Kraft, Shamiana and the Sea Lounge for the special warmth and attention. "
"I remember visiting the Gateway of India as a young girl and wishing I could stay in the Taj Mahal Palace, the most prominent and Iconic landmark. My wish just came true by the grace of God.  We stayed in the Heritage Wing to celebrate my mother in law's birthday. The gorgeous sea facing Club room was indeed a treat..  We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived. The service here is impeccable. The staff at the front desk, restaurants, concierge are all very courteous and polite.  Staying at the Taj is a once in a lifetime experience, but one I dream of repeating again."
"The Taj Mahal Palace regularly hosts weddings, and there is zero disregard for anything besides getting as many people as possible for the wedding. More than 15 people in a lift without masks which is meant for 4, loud music from the rooftop which literally makes rooms several floors vibrate. Would not recommend this to anyone.  Coffee shop is a disaster as well."
"Great check in by Ms mahtab / DM yohan and smooth stay at taj best suite to stay in lovely suite primrose suite felt like home #taj, they know how to treat their  regular guest well . A kind gesture and special regards to Arzaan Billimoria seen him as a front office , duty manager during my earlier days at the hotel great to see a hardworking person being rewarded by the group of Indian hotels . He will be happy to assist u from the most minute things u would need .Special thanks to sales team led by shaheen , ishita  . Staying here for our anniversary and it’s just amazing that this hotel never fails to live up to reputation u can get deals at Hyatt , trident,  st regis in mumbai but when it’s Taj palace every rupee spent is worth it . The service is smooth amidst the current"
"Just returned back from Taj Mahal Palace. We stayed there for 2 nights and travelled from pune just to relax. We being sea lovers, we paid much extra and booked luxury grande sea view room. Our check-in was quite smooth but as soon as we entered our room, we could sense something wrong in our room. Felt like we are staying in an old closed damp room. So we started finding out what’s wrong and to our surprise we found the whole bed-head was full of fungus!!!! The lamps and wall frames were full of dust. On escalating the matter, they changed our room to an executive suite room which had city view which we didnot want at all! But then, we agreed to stay as the room was very fresh and nicely done. Now comes the next part, we booked 2nights major meal and breakfast plan, and"
"Excellent as always, the front office executive needs to know the where about of members redeeming their points. could have utilised my points before they are lapsed.  Some process needs to be put in place for direct booking and redeem against TIC points. The current trip not reflected in the account.  "
"Our family of 7 stayed at the luxuriously stunning Gulmohar Suite, sea view club room and the Luxury room at the beautiful heritage Palace wing on 28th Nov to celebrate my birthday.  The Palace wing has incredible history and the elegant corridors are full of artifacts and paintings. There is no real way or words to describe this further without being present there in person - it is an experience in itself.  The hotel staff went above and beyond to make the experience unforgettable for the family.   My grandchildren thoroughly enjoyed the Towel Art which was specially organised for the kids.  Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so special for us! A special mention for Ms Cybercia, Mr Salian and Ms Beauty for being so kind and courteous.  Ms Mahtaab, Director Operations,"

"We stayed at the iconic Taj Mahal Palace to celebrate my mother's 66th birthday. We were a group of 4 adults and 3 children and stayed for one night on 28th Nov 2020.  The stay was truly a memorable and dream experience. The rooms were palatial and beautifully decorated.  I take this opportunity in complementing the staff for the outstanding hospitality received during our stay.   Sincere appreciation for Mr John and Mr Dattatray, the chauffeurs at Taj for driving us with a smile.  The check in was smooth and quick. A special mention for Ms Cybercia and Mr Gaurav Salian, Front Desk, for being warm and providing a quick confirmation on our queries.  The culinary delights presented by the chefs during breakfast and high tea were extremely praiseworthy. My 9 yr old son relished the"
"Visited the Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai in November 2020. The staff was warm and welcoming. The team at the reception was kind enough to give me an upgrade and when i requested to have a further tier upgrade just to have a sea view, Gaurav from the team got the staff to get an sea view room cleaned and sanitised. From the bell boys to the Managers, everyone was polite and up to the mark in hospitality. My package had meals inclusive and they ensured i had every meal in a different restaurant which was a feel good factor in itself. All in all a very good stay and a sheer deceiving of Luxury!"
"i stayed twice at the taj at gateway within 2 months. it is the finest hotel in the world the service is outstanding. the restaurants are the best. the level of professionalism, efficiency and friendliness of the staff is a whole other level. a 10 out of 10 experience guaranteed for anyone. the area is also vibrant and great fun. the covid protocols are very reassuring.  the hotel is being cleaned 24/7 it's absolutely spotless.  it's a must stay if you are heading to south bombay  for business, a vacation or any other purpose it caters to all.!"
"I checked in to celebrate my anniversary at the Taj Mahal palace Mumbai. I booked through booking.com atleast 2 weeks in advance. I expected a call from the hotel prior to my checkin date, however no one called. It was impossible to get thorough the hotel or their front desk. Upon arrival at the hotel the checking was pretty ok and I met  Ashutosh who introduced himself as the duty manager, I mentioned to him it was a special day for my so hurriedly they send across balloons in the room. I expected the rest of the saty would be uneventfull however I was in for a rude shock.

"I stayed there on 28th & 29th night in Luxury grand sea view on 4th floor and had requested for my husbands birthday celebration. What can we say my god when we entered the room it was decorated so beautifully that we both were surpised also food , hospitality and everything was perfect. Staying in taj palace with sea view was my dream since years and housekeeping team’s (Mr. Chandrakant) efforts were cherry on the cake. Right from Security to housekeeping every department 10/10 and works very efeciently.  Thank you from bottom of our heart.  Stay safe and healthy."
"I’m shocked at how bad Taj has become. From my favourite it has dropped to the worst hotel ever. Booked a stay at the suite for 4 days and what I got was Aloof staff, overbooked and crowded hotel, rooms stinking of disinfectant, extremely limited in room dining menu, tasteless food. I’ve been put oh hold for 30/40 mins to connect to the reception/operator.  Meals took more than an hour to come. I was overcharged 6000 rs for something I didn’t consume. Never staying here again. And I recommend no one does."
"I think most Mumbaikars as well as Indians dream of staying at a Luxurious Hotel, Taj Mahal would be on the list of most Indians and so was ours. We got an amazing deal owing to Corona so didn't wanna miss on such an opportunity.   Our Check-in took an hour and despite prior intimation about arrival were made to wait in the queue perhaps because they had lot of walk in customers on that day. We were given a nice sea facing room on highest possible floor and really felt the history and culture along with Taj Mahal in each and every aspect of the room. The walk in the aisles was like down a memory lane and so much to see and Enjoy as if was a guided Tour. We saw some Celebrities and ourselves felt like one. Our request for late checkout was accepted and we were glad to get the"
"excellent location, enchanting breathtaking view, great hospitality, fantastic food at the restaurants on the property. must stay hotel. enjoyed every moment of my stay. the paintings and artworks in the hotel are amazing, the staff is so well trained and always willing to help and serve with a smile. looking forward to my next stay in feb 2021 "
"Bad experience in Taj. No greeting from staff, no service, long waiting time, bad menu, waited for 1.5hours for a printout, staff has no idea what they are talking. Room is full of dust especially almirah and bathroom, overall not value for money hotel..  Better to enjoy another hotel In same price  The quality of Taj has degraded a lot."
"Warmth, ever eager Welcome ness, Superb food with superior quality, presentation and side ones. Follow-up, reminder, perfect valet services in current situation, seamless check in & checkout, Excellent Bar The Harbor bar  "
I stayed in luxury city facing room in this hotel. Check-in took almost an hour because of the inefficient staff and worst crowd management. Lunch was good in taste @masala kraft and staff was courteous but it took almost an hour again for food to be served. Dinner was worst with very less options and bad taste. Dinner was supposed to be served in Shamina restaurant but it was served in ballroom which spoilt the mood. There is nothing in terms of amenities in this hotel. Went there as I wanted to visit this property for a long time but definitely not worth the money.
"Great hotel , Gives me immense pride. The Best place to stay in Mumbai , styed here n-number of times but always feel fresh look , The rooms in the palace wing remind me of great inheritance and Indian culture"
Beautiful stay at TheTaj Mahal Palace we enjoyed every bit of it.. hoping to see you all soon. Taj has beautiful team like Mr. Nitin hooda and Mr. Ajay who was totally gem of a person.thank you team. Keep up the good work 
"Would advice to wait till the regulations of covid are removed.. Its porly managed Checkin, check out & parking. Also food experience was pathethic as it was done in Banquet hall ... do not buy all inclusive package.. then you will be able to enjoy their restaurants. else you will feel like have come to mediocre marriage and eating in dull banquet without any ambience and proper spread. "
It was a fish market at the time of Corona. Poor management  Poor food Rude staff I just wonder what happened to Taj group.  On my arrival to Taj Mahal Palace the 1st thought came to mind that I made a big mistake by choosing it. 
Best food very good service been given. Special delicacies were very good. Enjoyed a lot with my wife we had a memorable time at this place. All the requirements are been completed pm time  and with perfection.
"I remember visiting the Gateway of India as a young boy and wishing I could stay in the Tajmahal Palace, the most prominent and Iconic landmark towering above the Gateway of India, and be able to have a view of the Gateway of India and the Sea. My wish just came true by the grace of God. However; its not just the location but the spirit of India which the Taj embodies which makes it a unforgettable experience. I think its also the attitude and behaviour of the Taj staff, making every guest feel comfortable, irrespective of his socio-economic status, which could be the foundation of the success story which is the Taj or the crown. This is simply one of the best hotels in the world and you have to live it atleast once in your lifetime."
"Dear Travelers,   It is indeed with utter resentment, I am writing this review for The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel at Colaba Mumbai. I checked in dated 06/11/2020 for friends get together post this Covid pandemic. The experience is truly TERRIBLE and shocking.   1. At the time of check in it took 30 minutes for an illiterate Duty Manager Gaurav Saliyan to trace my booking. At the counter check ins our liquor bottles were neither questioned or stopped.   2. From the room we tried to order some veg snacks, which were not available. Therefore we opted nearby eatery to pack some snacks for us.   3. Security incharge Shamsher Singh stops us at the counter and rudely warns us not to carry the food inside. Ok with us. We addressed the issue to Duty Manager Gaurav Saliyan  who too behaved"
"Excellent hotel with excellent location located at the city center,extremely clean & comfortable . Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the friendly reception staff ,he makes our trip more interesting with his advice restaurants bars are within walking distance. Would definetely recommend this hotel to everybody! It's a true sample of excellent hospitality. Thank you again Taj  for going just that little step extra for the guests"
"This is how the other half lives. A property beyond luxury and elegance. The Taj Palace has two wings, the modern wing, and the Palace wing. When we were booked, we expected rooms in the modern wing, but were upgraded to Palace wing. The architecture is stunning. There are two lobbies one for each wing. Be aware that this is the hotel that was attacked by terrorists in 2008. The hotel was closed for two years, and there is a memorial for those killed in the new-wing lobby.   Both the rooms and hotel are elegant, with several dinning options, high-end shopping,  an outdoor pool, a spa and an historical tour of the hotel. If you arrive during wedding season, you will be treated to the lavish decorations ( and sometimes deafening noise ) of wealthy weddings. There was a wedding"
We had gone for my wife birthday and stayed in luxury room palace wing taj staff has decorated the room very well ambience was very good cleanness 100% and staff response was very acccurate and food was very nice 
"It was a great experience, lovely hospitality wonderful staffs with prompt response time. The room allocated was great. The service justifies the brand image. The pastry during the breakfast spread was amazing"
"Sitting near the window watching the sailboats, best experience ever. The cold coffee is to die for! We often used to go there with family for casual hi tea dining. Staff is always helpful Can't wait to visit it again"
"My experiences with Taj hotel has been so many times but this time they took me to other level I was feeling at home away from home at Taj Mahal Mumbai They remember me after so many months that was touching u feel u r at the right place Thank u for not letting me down and being with me,And meeting Ramneet Singh after so many days was a joy to watch Keep it up Taj Mahal u have a destination so get it Bless u Ranjit Singh"
I stayed here a night with my daughter for a family staycation and both of us were very happy with the stay. The Taj hospitality was evident everywhere and we were happy to be upgraded to the Palace wing. The rooms are opulent and luxurious. The amenities exceptional and the room service great. Would definitely look to visiting again soon!
"The aura of this property left us spellbound, exceptional in all the possible aspects, extremely courteous staff made our stay very memorable, special thanks to Chef Surendra Kamran for the wonderful ‘Dal Makhani’. Experience was simply magical.!! Keep up the good work. Thank you."
"Lovely rooms, stunning views from the restaurants on the higher floor, and great food. Meals for attendees with a window overlooking the Arabian Sea. In short, a perfect set up to rejuvenate. The hotel staff was very kind to upgrade my room from the hotel to the palace."
"Stayed here for one night to attend to attend a global conference. Lovely room, stunning view from the restaurants on the higher floor where breakfast was arranged. Meals for attendees with a windows over looking Arabian Sea."
"The palace won’t is very ornate Ofcourse and the sea view room has a beautiful water view. But what it the stay great was the manager on duty Ashish who went out of his way to help my elderly parents and I can’t thank him enough.  Also the shamiana staff Rajesh and Vaibhav and Conrad were so receptive kind and caring and even the man who brings fresh flowers near the pool Daily - Ajay I believe His name was, was so kind and caring. Even during these times his flowers made us feel we were in a good space. Thank u specially to the people mentioned above for making this a good stay for us."
my next home now in mumbai taj love it excellent service comfort stay sea view room i stay maximum hotels 5 star in india but this property is amazing i stayed 4 nights here completely relax & hygiene environment love it.
"Positives first : The hotel is open to guests in these difficult times. The staff, after testing covid negative, is not allowed to leave the premises...everyone is staying quarantined on the premises for months and still providing fantastic service with utmost grace. Only one of the 9 restaurants is open and they are doing their best with a limited menu. Kudos and hats off to Chef Raghu and all the staff. We had the first lunch in a restaurant after 6 months of covid ristrictions and we enjoyed it.  We went here with an expectation that the experience would not be as amazing as it always is. And to an extent we were right. As they are operating with limited staff, obviously the quality of experience has taken a hit. But we went anyway, in part, to express solidarity with our"
Beautiful Palace and the Tower. No words can describe how this magnificent palace is designed and built. The list of great people who visited here and stayed like their home tells their feelings and thoughts about the place. There is a guided tour of the palace for the guests. It tells you all about the place and is beauty. The view of the sea from the tower is breathtaking.
"Visited taj like 3 days back. Sent 2 bottles of wine to my friends room and asked if there is any discount, they offered 50% discount at the time of ordering and asked me to deposit 20,000 as an advance payment for liquor. I did deposit and at the time of refunding me the money which was left they started saying that no discounts were offered to you and didn’t even have some sense of talking. They just said sir we never promised any discount to you. They lie straight on your face, I highly recommend everyone to never book this hotel as they don’t treat Indians right because even at the time of checkouts i faced an issue as they helped a foreigner checking out before me who was actually in the cue after me."
Room cleanliness needs to taken more seriously. Paper bits lying on matting below the bed. No vaccum cleaning done there. Breakfast dish options are limited and repetative. No change in my 3 days of stay.
this is a must if your in mumbi the service is second to none the sandwiches cakes are to die for the views are superb the staff were fantastic and  all served with a great smile there was six of us and we all thought the same a little bit expensive but if your only here once you would regret it if  you dont
"I stayed here for Qurantine.... It was Wonderful Experience,The Service, Staff, Hotel Ambiance, Historical Frames,Lovely food, Pastry and ofcourse Unique Shops,My Room view of Gateway was Cherry on the .#452 Room to Remember for lifetime,,,Kind HK Associates Nitin Avhad,Rahul Kale,,,Gaurav Singh was very kind and Amazing Person,he solved our Room complaint within a hour!!! I think the Hotel name is Sustain because of such Hardworking people.  Subhashish from Reception was very Helpful and kind, he was paying attention to each and every guest, Unlike his Team leader and Above,they seemed to be very Selective and judgemental,while talking to the Us.... I am not sure How serious they will take this comment,but one thing is for sure this is very minor observation, but it can cause"
"Amidst the raging covid pandemic , we doctors at JJ hospital got the privilege of staying at the Taj. After working 8 hrs straight in inhuman conditions to come back to the heavenly comfort of the room and the finest food is something of once in a lifetime experience and I shall forever be indebted to The Taj."
"Excellent stay, excellent service, cooperative staff, Mr. Ramanand's cooperation and coordination has helped in our stay. Food was awesome and resturant staff was excellent. Beautiful property with great ambiance."
"Given the situation, my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised with the excellent service and knowledgeable & polite staff on duty. Then I reminded myself that Coronavirus or otherwise, this this is the Taj! There was no need to expect anything short of impeccable! Mahtaab the Operations Manager greeted me on arrival and ensured that my stay was happy & uneventful with an amazing eye for every detail. Yohan & the FO staff as well as F&B, HSK, Engg, Chauffeur and Security were sensitive to the Covid scenario, making sure that every precaution was taken for Guest & Staff safety without compromising on service standards."
"Can't describe it in words one has to come and experience the view, ambiance,location not to forget a dedicated team that is at your service in any situation with solution ready at had. It's a team effort that make it unique and the best in it's class."
"This is a fantastic hotel.  Everything just works and the staff are incredibly helpful.  Although we only stayed one night, we actually visited the hotel for 4 consecutive days as part of a function we were attending.  Each time we walked through the lobby entrance we were given such a warm welcome and the food was excellent every time.  On the day we actually checked in, it was as if they knew exacty when we were arriving.  We were immediately taken to the Atlantic bar for complimentary tea, where our Guest Services Executive (Subhashish Biswas) went thru the check-in procedure with us.  Subhashish was absolutely brilliant to us.   We had some problems with our onward travel arrangements - Subhasshish took care of it all, no fuss, no bother, just excellent service.  To cap it"
"This is truly huge hotel with excellent Service. Very nice and comfortable room ( Taj Club Sea View King Bed) with fantastic view on the Gates.  Also there are couple of very good restaurants in it so you don't need to go outside and may relax in the hotel. Our favourite was Japanese one and a waiter Netson is truly professional person with excellent service behind all expectations!!! He made our stay even better and because of his service me and my husband came to this restaurant for three dinners during our 3 day stay in the hotel and didn't want to change these restaurant for another one))) The hotel has big territory, so you may enjoy shopping, different food, bar and SPA."
"Last year, I went to the Taj Mahal Palace hotel when I was on the visit of the world tour, and my second journey was started in India after I went to Europe. I am in awe of this hotel and its hospitality. I know that 5-stars hotels are always considered as the best in terms of making their clients comfortable and give them everything they need.  So what is the different service which I get after spending one night in the Taj Mahal Palace hotel?  The first thing is the generosity of the people or great/helping behavior of Indians starts from the station which in my opinion named CST which is the busiest and biggest station of India.  The second thing the cleanliness and the third thing is the food.  The fourth thing might be the compliment items that they provided are a mixture"
"This hotel has to be the best I've ever stayed at. Upon arrival, there was a thorough security check which made the hotel feel very safe & secure. Entering the hotel, you immediately notice the gorgeous architecture and the aroma of rose petals. The architecture and art are best experienced in the historical wing of the hotel in which I recommend staying in.  The room was wonderful, especially the bathroom made entirely out of white marble. The cherry on top was when complimentary snacks were provided and refilled daily which was great for a quick snack. The best part is when I noticed that the staff had left me a bookmark after noticing my book on the night table.  The food is excellent, especially the breakfast at the Shamiana as it has dozens of delicious choices for all"
"Stay in the Palace side, enjoy the history of the hotel , the location and the unblievable staff. It was the closing signature of our India tour and did not disappoint. Yes it costs a bit, but compreed to London, Paris, New your equivilents is very reasonable."
"We were return visitors to the Taj and its magnificent architecture, rich history, elegantly appointed public spaces and rooms and charm are a delight.  It is truly special.  However what makes the Taj experience outstanding is the commitment and dedication of the entire team to the comfort and well being of its guests.   We would particularly like to recognize Ms. Cyberica,  Ms. Ankita,  Ms Devia and Ms. Beauty in the Sea Lounge.  They were particularly gracious, warm and kind , as was all the Taj staff.  We certainly look forward to returning to Mumbai and to the Taj Palace."
"You cannot find a better place to stay in mumbai, was a lovely experience of having a hair cut at a saloon inside the hotel. Tremendous hospitality. I would recommend every one to experience the same."
Fabulous family holiday at the Taj palace Mumbai. Fantastic service and wonderful food. Spotlessly clean and warm relaxing atmosphere. Attitude of staff very obliging. My daughter forget her laptop at Delhi airport security and the staff went out of their way to retrieve her laptop it was absolutely amazing how they worked as a team to help us and within 24 hours her laptop was in Mumbai. The concierge staff Mr Dinesh and Satish were just brilliant and so helpful. We would have not had this laptop without their help. The wonderful manager Miss Ankita  who was always very helpful. Thanks to everyone at the Taj hotel Mumbai for making our holidays exceptionally wonderful. We will definitely be coming back. Vandra family folded_handsfolded_hands
"Amazing hotel, beautiful rooms and the best part the most dedicated and friendly staffs like Rishi,Harendra,pallabi,Jiyan,Subashish,lalita headed by beautiful Mahtaab ....will be back soon!!!! If you are visiting Mumbai this hotel is a must!!! Thank you Taj Hotels for such a memorable stay!!"
"Did a last minute booking in the tower block through booking.com at a very reasonable rate. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a one-bed suite in the old building with a view of the Gateway of India. And what a suite! A living room bigger than at home and an even bigger bedroom, with walk in wardrobe, shower, loo etc and a free standing bath. As expected the welcome, service standards and cleanliness were all exemplary. The hotel is very conveniently situated with a large outdoor pool. Breakfast was exceptional. Very highly recommended especially if you can get a good deal."
"Unfortunately arrived for only a 1 night stay on the back of the closure of international boarders. Many thanks to the hotel for adjusting our itinerary at very short notice. A magnificent building with so much past and unfortunately recent history.  In keeping with all hotels of this standing we were pleased to be greeted by temperature testing and hand sanitizer readily available. Thank you for looking after us.  Greeted by Harendra Naidu, very professional, polite and informative arrival and room introduction thumbs_up. We were introduced to our floor butler for whom not request was to much. Room well appointed, clean and great view of the Gateway to India. The hotel was very quiet due to the current virus situation, staff were very helpful and polite. Had snacks and a drink in the"
"The high tea at the sea lounge at the Taj Mahal Palace is awesome!! The food , ambience and staff are all great . I recommend whenever u are in Mumbai next .... it’s a must visit !!! The old world charm , grace and warmth is exuded by the staff ."
"Amidst all the hotels I have visited, this one is one of the best. Within the busiest streets of South Mumbai, this one clearly stood out and offers  world-class services starting from customer experience, foods and super-luxurious rooms. Let the pictures speak for me. Shoutout to Veronica from Guest relations team, she proactively helped me during my stay in various aspects. She ensured that during my stay I don’t face any issues. It was admirable."
"I have been staying at this property for over 30 years.  There is absolutely to doubt that it has to be the best hotel in the world. The hotel staff starting from Subashish, Harendra and Rishi from front desk were outstanding. There is a large list of names I would like to thank for this marvelous stay and the feeing of being back home.  If you are visiting mumbai and don’t stay at this property your visit will not be complete. I will definitely be back!!!! Thank you for making my stay memorable!!!"
"If one want's to experience luxury but at the same time stick to true tradition nothing else beats the Taj. The stay, vibe, architecture to even the service all speak true Indian culture. Would not go anywhere else!"
"a strong smell of mold in the rooms makes impossible a good sleep! the hotel is special, everything looks good, the employees behavior is excellent, except that their big problem which is the smell in the rooms ... you can't really breathe! you can only open the window for an hour because the hotel doesn t allow it and even if you want to keep it open there is too much noise outside and you cannot sleep anyway."
"Stunning elegance with old world charm and character. Sea Lounge breakfast was extensive and delicious too. Staff extremely professional, pleasant and helpful too. The Hotel Tour was amazing and a definite must do."
"There are not enough stars available on TripAdvisor starstarstarstarstarstarstar to rate this hotel and it’s staff as deserved. From moment of arrival the front office Natasha Jassawalla and Sayonika Das greeted us and immediately made us feel like we had a welcome home and all through out our 6 day stay, the Taj Employees provide the most outstanding and extraordinary service and hospitality to their guests. A special thank you to Mrs Mahtaab Sidhwa and her entire team, also a heartfelt thanks to Dinesh Singh and all colleagues at the concierge, the sweet employees at The Sea Lounge, Wasabi, Shamiana and Souk and always a pleasure to meet the kind Vijay Bhattacharya. Taj family, thank you so much for all of your generous care during our stay. General Manager Sir Taljinder Singh, your"
"Stayed here for a night with my wife to celebrate her birthday. We had booked the Tower Sea View Room, but due to it being a special occasion they upgraded us to the Palace Wing, and I am very very thankful to TAJ for doing that. We had a warm welcome, following which at check-in, following which PALLABI and WASIM were very kind at the reception. We enjoyed some complimentary tea/coffee at the Palace lounge and our room was sea facing. It was decorated so beautifully that I cannot thank TAJ enough. My wife was very happy and it made our stay all the more special. The gym and pool are both beautiful (gym newly done up) and Pandurang and Jayaram were very kind in the mens wet area.   Room Service was handled beautifully by SAMRAT who makes sure to make you feel right at home. FOr"
"This is my 800th review on Trip Advisor, and this is the most amazing hotel I've stayed in! From the moment we arrived and the obligatory security checks to being given an explanation of everything in our luxury grand sea view room by Vinay, one of the front office Executives. Unlike the other hotels in our S India trip, the WiFi was perfect and we were able to have 4 devices between us. We had a personal butler, Faisal and nothing was too much trouble for him, wether it be organising 'tea for 2' on arrival or booking restaurants / tours, he was there for us. All the team of staff in the hotel were lovely and I wish I knew all their names, but even the man who opened the security gate every time as we walked up the huge sweeping staircase to our 3rd floor room was always"
"Such an Memorable stay. We met Mr. Wasim at the reception and he was very courteous and helpful. I would like to thank Chef Edward Raja for the tasty dishes. My sincere thanks to Arrif, Ilvika and Preethi for making this a wonderful stay. "
"I visited the Sea Lounge restaurant on 17th March 2020 I am appalled at the level of service received.  Firstly, the food is overrated and has no flavour. The cappuccino was cold. I came all the way from London to visit and have been so disappointed with this place. It didn’t feel luxurious at all! Then when it came to payment, I told the waiter to charge me in Indian Rupees and how cunning they charged me in GBP so they overcharged me by around £8 which is a lot around 700 rupees. I’m just lost for words. Therefore, I would not recommend this place at all!  P.S currently waiting for Taj to process the refund for the extra amount they have charged. I have proof of receipt too which shows the amount in rupee vs GBP."
"After a long trip in India I finally arrived in Bombay. We had a fairly hectic journey and a pretty rough trip from the airport. The check in process at the hotel was amazing, our room was spectacular and the sea view lounge Was this a quiet break from a hectic Vacation in India. I had an amazing time and can’t wait to go back, I would also like to thank Kevin Podder In the Seaview lounge made myself and my mother feel at home"
"I still can't believe I had the opportunity to stay in the most beautiful and Breathtaking hotel in all Mumbai.  At the reception the amazing operation manager Ms Mahtaab p Sidhwa welcome us with a big smile and a worm words. She upgrade us from the tower to the palace and surprised us with luxurious gifts. The room was amazing, with a welcome refreshment. The bathroom is stunning smiling_face_with_heart-eyes Breakfast is delicious with an attentive service. The employees taking care of you and looking for you with all their heart.  The prices at the restaurants of the hotel was over prices for India. I understand that its a luxury hotel, but the prices is still the prices don't make sense, to pay for dinner more then what we pay for a room, is not appropriate.  As a leading hotels standard's trainer for"
"awesome is the first word  that comes to mind.reception, food, service staff everything was impeccable.truly lived to our expectations and really felt like it deserves the richness and grabdeur that is part of its reputation. kids enjoyed the cup cake workshop and artists corner very much. looking forward for the next stay special mention TO the HERITAGE TOUR."
"Awesome - all the staff were courteous, helpful and efficient  Will definitely stay here again  The check in was fast, breakfast was excellent and the room was very comfortable  The location is good and the views were fantastic   "
"I spent 2 nights in the hotel and there were my really happy days of my 2 week India journey. It was my second time in Mumbai (first time I stayed in Oberoi). Everything in Taj was great  as I expected: a beautiful hotel, a hospitable staff, an excellent breakfast, a comfortable bed, a perfect location. I don't find anything to complain about. Ahh,  once someone of the staff while meeting me didn't greet me as if I didn't exist at all but the next second he was so sweet and polite to the other (male) guest passing by, that I felt sad for a second.  But it doesn't important at all comparing to the immense positive experience and great atmosphere I found there. And I liked a heritage walk also. Ladies, who work in the hotel, are very beautiful and elegant! Staff is  attentive to"
"It was a great experience , enjoyed so much Taj hotel is one of the best hotels around the world and the rooms and the inviroment is wonderful too , have nothing to complain about, I would like to thank the hotel management and the staff for the great experience and services"
"We stayed here over a New Years visit to Mumbai and it was fabulous. The location is beautiful and the staff and service were some of the best I have ever experienced. Staff was attentive but also gave us space. The best tours we booked in Mumbai were through the tourism desk. We also dined at several of the onsite restaurants which (while expensive) were really wonderful. This place absolutely feels like an oasis, away from the hustle and bustle of the city but also right at the center of it."
"This is a real historic experience. It’s a swanky, expensive place which lives up to the billing of being ‘the Taj’. Opposite the Gate of India and the sea, it’s a great location. Full of the wealthy of Mumbai and people who want to be seen. If you like the sort of hotel that has a Louis Vuitton and Panerai shop in the lobby, this is for you. If you like something more understated then go for the Oberoi. This is bling with a capital dollar sign. The Tower is the more business wing, the Palace is the more luxury and very swanky. Great service of course but if you’re reading this to decide whether to spend you’re money on the experience , then make sure it’s the right experience for you. "
This is a hotel with history fully restored and updated. The service at all Taj Group hotels is always great - friendly and efficient. Their staff training programmes are excellent.  Being just by the Gateway of India you can walk out of the hotel and sense and feel the city around you.
"What a beautiful and wonderful place to be at! The experience is amazing. The views from the hotel of The Gateway of India, the sea and just the bustling city, is majestic. The rooms and halls in the hotel is class apart. I loved how everyone here was courteous and friendly. The shops inside the hotel in ground floor should definitely be visited. You can come here at any season."
The white marble and the size is overwhelming. It is beautiful from all areas. A true must to see and absorb the beauty. Let a guide explain the details to you.  A must see in Agra. It is said to be a place of love and it was a great experience.
This is one of the most beautiful hotels according to me  in India. Ive had the best prawns ever in one of the restaurants in the Hotel. The food was amazing and all the Designer shops are so catchy. Never had a dull moment and never wanted to leave either.
It was my husband's 75th birthday and my entire family had come to drop us at the hotel and we where surprised by the beautiful hospitality which we witnessed right from the balloons in our room. All the best.
"We have always got the best hospitality and warmth at all the Taj Hotel properties stayed and dined. Be there to experience the best cuisine local or continental, butler service, welcome experience. You always feel pampered "
"Was in this hotel about 25 years ago and how lovely it was to be back. In this city of hooters, scooters and polluters, it's a tranquil haven. Beautiful room with every possible amenity, great view of the Gateway to India. Excellent breakfasts, lovely bar for pre-dinner cocktails and a super choice of restaurants. I chose Souk. The pool is pretty with a peaceful garden, resplendent with fresh flowers. can't beat it."
"There is very little that I can say about the Taj Mahal Palace that hasn't already been said hundreds of times previously on this site. I have just completed my second stay there so let me just speak directly to you... Staying at 'The Taj'  is a wonderful experience, and yes , it is a bit more expensive than some other places , but it really is a case of 'what you pay for is what you get ' and anyway don't you owe it to yourself ?  If you're reading the reviews you must be already interested...so go on just do it...you won't be disappointed."
"An oasis in Mumbai. Great location next to the Gateway of India. Ask for a room with the view of the Arabian Sea and the Gateway of India. Don’t be disalarmed that they bomb sweep the cars...pop the hood and trunk and check underneath with the mirror. They will have you go through the airport scanners every time you enter the hotel.  One of the most powerful showers we have ever had. It was wonderful.   It is a nice hotel. This is really more a 4 star than a 5. It is nice, just not as nice as many 5 star hotels we have been to. The public areas are the best part of the hotel.10 PM or later is too late for turndown service. We reported an issue with our kettle leaking. They never brought a new one. Five Star is about service.  Clear plastic wires over pool to keep the pigeons"
"As soon as you enter the vast and beautiful lobby of the Taj Hotel you know you are somewhere very special, there is a real sense of occasion and place.  There are two distinct parts to the hotel - the original Taj whith its beautiful rooms with bay windows overlooking the sea and passers-by below.  There is a wonderful outdoor swimming pool surrounded by a lovely garden, an oasis in a busy city.  The Tower at the Taj is a modern building with not as much character, but beatifully appointed with fantastic views of India Gate - you could sit on your balcony all day just watching the comings and goings to it.  It was my birthday the day after I left the Taj and they had no need to acknowlege it, but on returning to my room I found the bed full of birthday balloons and rose petals"
"All I can say is wow face_with_open_mouth. We have travelled extensively but never before experienced this level of quality and service. Every part of the experience seems to have been choreographed to meet the needs of the guests. From private check in, to butler services. Pre dinner cocktails to post dinner cognac. No expense is spared in providing the finest cuisine and experiences. The building itself is immaculate and impressive, the suite spacious and Beautifully decorated,but what stood out for me were the people,who couldn’t do enough to ensure our stay was perfect."
The palace is full of history and absolutely beautiful. Rooms are traditional and very spacious with a lovely view. I recommend to try the palace then the tower during your stay in Mumbai. The house keeping team will take great care of you and your room.
Truly one of the best hotels in the world. Superb service. Staff are so respectful. Food is great. They do not spare any effort to make sure you get exactly what you want. Inside the hotel is a sanctuary completely cut off from the hurly burly of the world outside.
"Se room which have city view , not so good and very clumsy so it's better to take sea view Room. Breakfast buffet is very good. Staff is very polite. My room is upgraded after I complained for the same.it located very posh location and market , marine drive near by. "
"Was visiting for the first time as i went for a business thing. I was quite lost and went to the wrong gate in which the staff were making fun of me! One staff was asking ""where you're going"" i said i came to see... And he replied with attitude saying ""so!! It's close"" thinking am i in the star hotel so called Taj!! Being in many hotels didn't expect a short, rude reply from staff... Although coffee shop are doing great..Keep it up..will never come back tho.."
It is my favorite hotel. My room was on the top floor of Heritage side. Very nice view. Great service and very courteous staff.. Breakfast spread was huge. I COULD EAT DIFFERENT COMBINATION EVERYDAY DURING MY 3 DAYS STAY..
"First up - the food and service at Souk was great. Couldn't have had it any better. But - My fiancé proposed to me at the Souk in February and had approached Taj Memories to take pictures for us on our special day. We wanted the soft copies of the images, for which he sent an email to them. I don't think they sent him the images- so I called them. The lady on the phone was extremely rude, non cooperating and aggressive.  Furthermore, instead of asking for additional details that she needed from my partner, she started finding faults wrt some incomplete information given and sternly told me that one of his cousins came and collected one of the pictures so I should speak to her etc. I understand privacy and security and all that but this is just no way a customer is to be spoken"
I visited Shamiana on 2nd March. Food was delicious and Azar is really good in service. I wanted to try home style Indian food and he suggested me Dosa and Pav Bhaji. Thank you for good time at Taj. Will be back soon.
The ambience and feel of this hotel is fantastic from the moment you arrive. The staff are genuinely warm and welcoming   The room was very nice and a complimentary fruit basket was provided. They are immaculately clean as are the adjacent corridors and walkways and there are some interesting pieces of art on every floor.  We had an nice breakfast every morning with fresh delicious food and beverages.The bars were also great as was the live music  My only complaint is this. People stay here because they can afford it so please do not hussle them into upgrading the Wifi for a few extra dollars by limiting the number of devices and speed. It is not a matter of money but a source of irritation especially with a hotel of this standard.  Otherwise highly recommend to everyone  
What an incredible hotel. No words can describe the beauty.  Well worth a visit even if its just for tea/coffee.  The craftsmanship is out of this world.   The staff are so welcoming and helpful.  The hotel is so clean and tidy.  
"4 night stay at this elegant waterfront hotel overlooking the ""Gateway to India"" arch structure.  Centrally located to see both colonial buildings as well as the Victoria Terminus, fish market, commercial laundry sites, lunch box delivery men's staging area, etc.  Strongly recommend staying here - luxurious, wonderful rooms, views, helpful staff, wonderful breakfast options.  Large exterior pool area for relaxing and enjoying an afternoon hour after a day of touring."
"My Taj feedback form was already expired so you will get my feedback here: This was my second visit in 2 months. This time I was on a short business trip but you made it feel like almost a holiday. I did not have much time to stay at the hotel, but the details were still there, I was especially thankful for the bunble bath and hot footh bath. A very nice to relax after a long day. I will definitely return. Thank you again!"
"What a fabulous hotel, the service is fabulous and nothing is too much. The main entrance looks really good but on entering you are met with a stunning reception area. So many beautiful sofa sets to sit and people watch and the flower displays are enormous and absolutely stunning.  Further on is a stunning water monument to the very many people who were murdered in the terrorist atrocity in the hotel and of course the security is excellent to enter the hotel. The waterfall and inscription  is very beautiful and so sad to read. A fitting monument to a sad situation.  We visited for coffee  in the Sea Lounge and had a beautiful table. I ordered a slide of cake with coffee, my husband ordered tea. Really well presented and my husband was presented with croissants too as well."
"We are a family of four whom had stayed at the Taj at the beginning of Feb 2020.We have found it the most beautiful property to stay at..Location of hotel is magnificentThe hotel itself is luxuriously fitted out.The surroundings are marvellous.The staff are of the best calibre.The rooms are beautiful,bright and colourful The cleaniness is of the top drawer.Room service second to none.The spread of food in the restaurants is excellent.Breakfast one could not ask for more. The heritage of this property is currently in very good and capable hands. Will I visit again most definately"
We are very pleased with our stay at Taj Mahal palace Mumbai staff was very co operative and very kind good manner wants to stay again soon .. only problem is that hotel outside environment is very noisy specially night time dog barking .. 
We stayed in the tower wing with a sea facing room on the 17th floor overlooking the Gateway and the ater beyond. The room had a small balcony as well.  Our visit was short as we arrived at midnight and were leaving at 10pm but nevertheless enjoyed the facilties on offer. Do go on the tour of the hotel which appears to run twice each afternoon but has to be booked - you are lead by the hotel's historian who narrates via headphones various interesting stories about the hotels genesis and devleopment.  Breakasft in the twoer wing was excellent with a very wide choice of food available and  a chef on hand to prpeare freshh offerings too - largely egg based. In the evening we enjoyed  a cocktail in the older part of the hotel before eating in the Sea Lounge at a table by the window
"Travelling solo, I felt safe and at ease at The Taj Mahal Palace. I was looked after very well and the ambience was second to none. I hope I get to stay again. Location was convenient and restaurants were great."
"This was a hotel that my partner had wanted to visit for some time and so we decided to book a Sea View Club Room for 3 nights. The whole experience was exceptional from our chauffeur drive and personal greeting on our arrival through to the butler service and luxurious facilities (the swimming pool is exceptional). On arrival we were met at the door and, following a traditional welcome, we were taken straight to our room to complete the check in. Our room on the 5th floor overlooked the Gate of India and offered panoramic views of Marine Drive.  Throughout our stay the staff, without exception, were welcoming and attentive and when we told our butler that we were going to spend the morning at Elephanta Island he returned within 5 minutes with a packed lunch - incredible. We ate"
"The Taj Palace is one of the best hotels in the world-- maybe the best.  Gracefully designed, brightly adorned with flowers everywhere, the Palace is the very essence of old world glamour.  Even the staircases deserve a photo or two.  The hotel rooms have every amenity possible (I had both bath and separate shower), and they are luxurious to the extreme.  They place a design of flower petals on the floor of your suite.  The service is beyond excellent.  Everyone there is generous, pleasant, helpful beyond their station.  A man knocked on my door to say, ""I am your butler Madam.  How can I help?""  The food in the hotel restaurants was excellent.  The buffet breakfast was wonderful. When I wanted something not on the menu, the chef made it for me.  Everyday you get to view the"
wonderful place - great staff reading in your eyes what they can do for you - wonderful surrounding - the pool in the fantastic garden -  it can not be better - we return to the Taj every year for our anniversary
"I thought it could not get better but it did. The attention to detail in this exquisite hotel revivals the Oberoi. Greeted with a drink while they do the necessary paperwork, the floor butler arrives with some welcome treats and some orientation information. Lunch in the area off the pool is perfectly designed and the food is delicious. The room is well appointed and romantic! Prime Ministers, Presidents, movie stars and even the Queen of England have stayed here to name a few. Even John and Yoko!!! Worth a trip to Mumbai just to stay here!!!"
"Why only four stars? I have no major complaints the staff were excellent, facilities first class, location excellent and a breakfast to die for. But for me it’s just a little to big, busy and pretentious for my taste. Glad we stayed though. "
"The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is probably one of the best hotels in the city.  Located right next to the Gateway of India, it’s in a perfect location to see this beautiful city.  Staff, service, facilities and food were all very good, but I had two serious concerns with the hotel.  We reserved a Taj Club Room with a Sea View.  After checking in about midnight, we noticed the next day that room, as lovely as it was, did not match the picture shown for the room on the hotel’s web site.  No big bay window and seating area for breakfast or tea overlooking the sea.  When I brought this to hotel’s attention, their only response was, “The picture’s wrong on the web site.”  No apology, no offer to correct.  We were leaving the next day, so not worth pursuing, but it certainly left a"
"While on a business trip to Mumbai India, I got to stay at the historic Taj Mahal hotel in downtown Mumbai. It’s location is ideal, just across from the Queen’s Gate and waterfront. The building architecture is beautiful. The accommodations were wonderful. The restaurants and food choices within the resort....amazing. Top notch service and luxury. So glad I got the chance to stay. If you have the chance to take the hotel history tour, do it. What a great rich history for a beautiful Indian icon"
The Taj Mahal Palace hotel is a true gem. Have stayed there several times. Nothing else comes close. Tb  we level of customer friendly service is simply unparalleled especially the booking/concierge and room floor staff. 
"What an amazing hotel. The room we had was magnificent overlooking the Gateway of India. It had all the modern facilities you would expect from a Taj. The food was superb, particularly the Soukh which was an incredible experience. The general service from all the staff was the best I have experienced. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Mumbai."
"Our 8th floor room in the new tower overlooked the Gateway to India, great views of that landmark and the colorful boats and constant crowds in the harbor. The Taj, of course, is an iconic hotel. The staff is excellent. But it's not perfect. The breakfast room is not large enough for the numbers of people staying at the hotel and it's very cramped in some areas. That said, the quality and variety of the food is excellent. The Souk, a rooftop bar/restaurant is a missed opportunity. The tables offer very little in the way of a view. Meanwhile, the area immediately around the hotel needs an upgrade. Yes, Mumbai is chaotic, but there's no reason why the Taj can't have a walkable sidewalk at least on all sides of their own property. Lastly, more good news. if you have time, take the"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a magnificent hotel filled with enormous charm and we have returned for a third time in a short space of time . We normally use the airport pick up service right through to our check out which is first class however as we have upgraded our flight travel this time round it wasn't needed for our transfer in.  We are currently staying in the club room facilities within the palace and it is as always spectacular. The palace has an incredible atmosphere and you can feel and see the history all around you as you walk through the corridors.  The club rooms are beautifully decorated and offer access to the palace lounge for high tea and  the sea lounge for pre-dinner drinks....however, somewhat disappointing this time round is that the pre-drinks 'complimentary"
"We stayed here for 2 nights.Location of the hotel is the best you can imagine. Taxi from airport takes around 1h15min - with the average traffic. View from the window is really worth the money! Room itself is not the biggest one, but it has all you need to spend a night in. Room are specious and clean. Swimming pool area is clean and nice to seat near by in the evening. Staff from reception to housekeeping to service was remarkable. Thank you for your warm hospitality. Definitely we are coming back!"
"An excellent and outstanding experience, room with a sea view. What really did it for me was not the dinner which was excellent but at breakfast where I was speaking with the service chap and mentioned that I had returned to Bombay after many a year and had fond memories of the local batata vada, but was to scared to eat on the streets... and low and behold he had the chef prepare it for me.... unfortunately I didn’t catch his name but his Manager definitely knows who he is  Excellent Bombay hospitality"
"I had always wanted to stay in this hotel and it definitely did not disappoint. We were greeted with a traditional Indian greeting and lay. The room was lovely, we had opted for a sea view,  and we could see the gate of India from our window. By far the best was the breakfast room it was superb and had everything you could want. We thoroughly recommend. "
Excellent hotels. It has gum and many out fits.but cost of hotels sum what higher solo can funny inthe hotel.it swimming pool for swimming. Services is good and food items are good and it has paid parking service
"Returning to The Taj is returning home. Love the atmosphere, the place, the service and everything about it. It is certainly one of the most attractive hotels in india and probably in the world. I would certainly recommend it."
"Stayed in a sea view executive club room. Loved every minute of this marvellous piece of history.  Breakfast was excellent and the food we had at the hotel delicious. We did a tour of the hotel, highly recommend. Rooms were well appointed and very comfortable. "
We had a great experience at the hotel and the staff was very friendly and helpful  Amazing interior and hospitality  Breakfast and dinner was too good. Quality hotel will all amenities  I thank taj for this amazing experience
Day was going good but it became worst when we brought food inside the room. They came up with food policy that we cannot bring outside food inside the room. Really strange getting alcohol from outside is fine but food is not allowed. Despite of  having few drinks from souk we thought of getting some food stuff from out but they dint allow. Have stayed in other 5* star hotels like JW Marriott Mumbai Juhu etc but never faced such issues. This is really horrible never expected this behaviour from Taj. I Two days back i was in diff taj in mumbai and they allowed all.  Now i am in taj mahal and they only allow outside alchohol.  Common guys. Grow up.  Dont give reason like contamination instead of revenue.  
"This is a piece of history, a wonder from the colonial times, built by Jamshedji N Tata,in 1903, overlooking the Gateway of India in Mumbai. But before you wonder, yes, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel was there, before the Gateway Of India was built.   Everything here is regal. Built with utmost attention to detail and maintained in tip top condition today, you are transported into a different era. You would expect to find Sommerset Maugham having a cup of evening tea at the lounge. lit will chandelliers and the setting rays of the sun add a twirl of charm tunnelling in the orange rays as well for effect.  Our room on the 4th floor had a balcony window opening out to the Gateway of India buzzling with people in a riot of colours. Many of them gazing at the Taj.   You have a floor"
Well yet another great stay at this lovely hotel. The staff and service we received was exceptional. We ate at the Massala and Chinese restaurants and had really good food.  We also used the salon which offers great service without rushing and making you feel valuable.
"We spent 3 weeks in India and the last night of our holiday was spent at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.  This was without doubt an amazing experience, and we were looked after brilliantly on arrival and throughout our stay at this wonderful hotel.  The staff could not do enough for us and they deserve so much credit for the work they do.  We were amazed to discover that they upgraded our room at no extra cost.  The room we had was simply stunning.  Included in the package we had was afternoon tea, dinner, drinks, breakfast and afternoon tea again the next day before we checked out.  The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is an experience I whole heartedly recommend"
"Mumbai is one of my favorite city in the India .This month I married and I went to Mumbai for my honeymoon and I stay in Taj Mahal hotel it's located in Apollo bandar ,it's sea touch hotel great room lovely welcome here I totally loved it's experience"
"I love the Taj ! From the moment you arrive everything is wonderful! The flowers in the lobby ,the checkin .when we got to our room there were red roses and a happy anniversary pillow , then the balloons arrived ! Next day a beautiful cake . Thank you taj , nothing is too much trouble ."
"We treated ourselves to a night at the Taj palace following a wedding in India. The hotel is beautiful, and the service and facilities exemplary. We had an amazing lunch at Sea Lounge (have been before, and had to come back!), and a great spa experience as well. Our only complaint was that we took our friend to her room first, and actually commented on how nice it smelled... walking into ours (across the hall), we found it to be slightly musty. The hotel did what they could to fix it, but suspect some issues with damp. Nevertheless, the experience was unforgettable, and we’d love to go back one day!"
"The location is perfect and the service very good.  I could not enjoy all the services because I had a very full  day, but every thing was perfect, the food in the restaurant is very european, not exactly indian, too mild with no strong character.  The rooms are confortable and clean!"
We had a great stay leisure @Taj Mahal Palace. The property is one of the best ever property I have stayed as the kind of hospitality and welcome as a guest one gets is truly identical. The property is situated at heart of Colaba which connects to various impeccable tourists spots within Mumbai suburban. The restaurants offers more than array of both contemporary Indian & other food traditions.
Lovely hotel turned out to meet all our expectations! Rooms are large and well appointed and the cooling system worked perfectly. Had view of the sea and the Gateway to India. Loved the buttons by the door for cleaning and privacy. Every time I put the cleaning button on they were here in a snap. Food in all the restaurants was wonderful and service was great! Only staying three nights but would come back for sure if I have the opportunity.
"Simply put, go it is absolutely breathtaking and very interesting to hear about the history of the place. Yes it can get busy, we were there at 3.30 till 6pm, it was magical. Well worth paying for a guide."
"We have only arrived but already I am sad to say we are underwhelmed.  Firstly we booked the luxury car which while the driver was lovely for £100. The car is disappointing a Jaguar and well used is the best I could say. Our checkin was nothing special just being rushed through reception not invited to sit but given the red dot and welcome necklace ,then  up to our room for checkin.  The room is old and not remotely how I would have expected it to feel and when asked if I liked the room and said no I was a little surprised it wasn’t a more recent refurbished feel he just told me all rooms are the same and moved on. Doing nothing to suggest we might have an option of a different room. Also we were not told about the tap water as if it was safe or not so I had to call down to"
Extremely clean hotel. The room was excellent and clean with all facilities inside.  Best hospitality. The check in/out was quick. Best service.  Beautiful place. At the center of the colava. Infrant of GATE OF INDIA. 
As our only trip to Mumbai we decided to visit the Taj Palace. We wanted to go inside see the shops have a drink and book afternoon tea. when trying to get in via what used to be the main entrance on the main road the male and female door staff immediately with the usual indian mentality said no basically. We were both very smartly dressed. It was embarrassing and shocking to be treated so poorly. Clearly if you want to go inside you have to be a paying guest or turn up in an £80k car. Well Taj Palace middle_finger_light_skin_tone. I emailed them with this but yet to get any response. Stay at the Trident near Nairman point and just view this hotel from outside.
"Beautiful old magestic hotel, in the Harbor very nice lobby and nice rooms, beautiful garden and pool , service 100%, shops and restaurants inside the hotel,very good food, expensive but great!!! Highly recommended!"
"My husband and I stayed at the Taj for 4 nights and it was the best holiday experience we have ever had. Everything was flawless and the hospitality was amazing. We booked through our agent ""Total Holiday Options"" so we never really dealt with hotel directly but from the moment of arrival we felt like we knew the staff personally. I truly cannot find a fault. We can't wait to come back in the future!"
"I love this hotel, it’s simply amazing, the staff are fantastic and every time we come here we are made to feel special each time.   I don’t think I’d ever fall in love with another hotel like I do here. "
"Taj Mahal Palace is certainly one of if not the best hotel we have stayed in. Our first time as resident guests being Mumbaiaites.    The hotel exceeded our expectations and how. Obviously the location is super. The sea room gave us ample view of the beautiful sunrise! The housekeeping does a fantastic job of making the rooms look ultimate. The club / palace services make you feel royal. The gourmet team ably led by the restaurant managers and chefs ensures that your gourmet fantasies are take. Care. The hotel concierge and bell desk are extremely helpful. The welcome , the check in and out are most warm . You just don’t feel like leaving!! Well done team TMP "
"Culturally significant for many old and new reasons, this hotel provides a comfortable home in the midst of a very busy city. The rooms are lovely, the service is impeccable, and the breakfast in the Sea Lounge is amazing. Highly recommended!"
It was a very beautiful and comfortable stay. This is one of the best hotel in the entire world. I recommend this hotel for any kind of travels whether it's a business trip or a family trip.overall it was a great experience to stay with Taj. I stayed here for my business trip this time but will surely come back again with my family to enjoy again. The staff was superb. Well trained and professional. Thanks to entire Taj team for making my stay so comfortable.
"It was a brilliant stay at this iconic property. There wasn't anything not to like about this beautiful heritage hotel. From the moment I stepped in, I was taken back in time and could feel the history. The old world charm was definitely well preserved.   The decor of the entire property was mesmerizing. The corridors were brilliant and the rooms were spacious and nicely done up. The setting by the pool area was perfect, particularly to chill all through the day. The fitness centre was spacious and it was more than just functional.   The service was exceptional all through. The entire team was helpful, friendly and prompt. You'd be sure to feel most welcome.  If there was anything to complain, it was that the rooms were a little on the noisier side. You could hear people honking"
"Visited the Taj Mahal Hotel after a boat trip to the Elephanta Caves. Hoping to have afternoon tea. We were told it didn’t start until 3/3.30. However no afternoon tea was being served that day, as sandwiches and a 200yr old champagne as alternatives would be available, which seemed something to go for. Down stairs at the reception to book, we were informed the drink was replaced with a sparkling wine. Some very conflicting information being given out from staff. Felt like staff had not been briefed on what was being offered, making it up depending on what question the customer asked, Very poor. Ending on a positive note, we had some snacks and drinks in one their restaurants. These were excellent, the staff were very positive an accurate on what was on the menu. "
"Stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for a family friend's wedding. Had a very comfortable and pleasant stay. The hotel staff were prompt and very polite especially one waiter MagalHaes who paid special attention to us and was very helpful. He deserves a special mention not only for his warm, friendly demeanour but for being loyal to the Taj Mahal Palace for close to 40 years!! He's an inspiration and I'm so glad that he waited on our table."
Food n service is excellent everything thing was fantastic all was nice Vaibhav and Russell took good care thanks for making the evening special will be visiting soon guy's keep up the service the same.
"Our family booked two “sea view club rooms” in the Palace for sadly just one night.  We arrived at 10.00am not expecting to be able to check in so early but this is when the Taj Palace experience started. We were taken to the Palace Lounge where refreshments were offered while the check in formalities took place in tranquillity. Not only could we check in early but were upgraded to the stunning Maratha suite on the 6th floor with an interconnecting room. This review would be too long to describe just how great the service was and how absolutely fantastic these rooms were. The attention to detail is incredible and there certainly was nothing we could fault. The view of India Gate and the ferry boats, the bathrooms along with their quality amenities and abundance of soft white"
" and historical  architecture, Luxurious and spacious garden and swimming pool, with a incredibile service, after arrival you feel immediately at home and loved , everyone is so helpful and caring. Once again best hotel in the world so far!"
We stayed here for a a few nights and what a beautiful place. The service was excellent and the rooms and the pool were brilliant. Its  so peaceful and the restaurants are excellent. We had a lovely rooms with great views  I will for sure go back again soon.
"Our stay in this hotel was better than expected, especially where the staff was most friendly, and always smiling. There is no room for any complaint in any respect.  Service, food and other facilities have been beyond our expectations. "
"I stayed here for 2 nights and it was absolutely stunning. Front desk, room stewards, security at the entrance; all top notch. The pool is lovely however it was very noisy with constant horn tooting, not overly relaxing (just take ear plugs or noise cancelling headphones).  I ate in the Aquarius cafe by the pool and I had a paneer tikka wrap (delicious) and a glass of Italian Prosecco for the equivalent of AUD$48, so pretty eye watering, I mean this is India after all.... What they don’t tell you is that they add 40% taxes & charges to the menu price, so what you think will be cAUD$30, ends up being very expensive. I didn’t eat in the actual restaurants so I can’t imagine what those prices would be like. Fabulous hotel but fair warning if you choose to eat in-house. I’m still"
taj mahal palace is mumbai s one of the finest and one of the most stylish hotel .Great hospitality and i totally loved it lovely hotel room it was and warm welcome won my heart food was awesome amaze me
It was a pleasant evening dinner because of good Hospitality by Mr Shetty who served mouth wondering fish and chicken with white sauce pasta Sea lounge has beautiful ambience so I oftenly visit this place .
"Best staff in any hotel in the world, I travelled the world but this one stay I really rate, they made me feel like a king. From the booking to the doorman was different class .  Breakfeast was too good. Taj Mumbai staff u rock, keep it up see u again next year "
"The Taj is the pinnacle of luxury and service as delivered to the rich, famous and powerful. Photographs of the likes of Mick Jagger, Michael Cane, Lady Diana, Jean Paul Guatier and many more proudly on display  There is also the chilling memory of the horrific events of 2008 when more than 100 people were murdered in a horrific terrorist attack on Mumbai."
"We were there for one of our special days in Jan 2020 and they made it a memorable day by pampering us with flowers, red carpet and cake ! Everything about this hotel is classy ! Whether its walking down the stairs to the breakfast room ,where if you lucky to grab one of the window seats to watch the glorious sunrise along with the gateway of India,or just watch the sunrise from your room...its a wonderful experience and perfect beginning to the day ! Staff are very warm and willing to help to make the stay comfortable . A walk in the main lobby which is always bustling , makes one realise the history of this hotel and makes one feel privileged indeed to have gotten the chance to enjoy this luxurious hotel !"
You can’t but be impressed by the scale of this historic building and its majestic location   On the service front it does not always deliver as expected  On arrival the welcome was perfunctory at best at reception and our bags seemed to take for ever to arrive in the room. A call was required to the duty manager to find them. Multiple attempts were then needed to get the right selection of welcome teas to our room!!  The buffet breakfast in the Sea Lounge is an institution and a window table is a must if you can get one - we were lucky both mornings - super friendly service  The residents only terrace restaurant by the pool again has excellent service and a very delicious menu selection   The international restaurant was not up to the standard of the pool terrace   If they
"Happy to be there, is our first time. We have great experienced there. It's our first visit to India for our franchise Belmont maid services that how we visited the hotel because my  my colleagues told us that it is a nice place to stay."
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel Mumbai is a unique hotel, full of history and endless stories ... such a beautiful place to relax despite the very busy location Apollo Bandar, Colaba and The Gateway of India or what others call it Gate of India. Luxury hotel, amazing services, best restaurants not forgetting to mention the exclusive Spa.... My 4 nights stay was 2 nights before I went to Udaipur and 2 nights after I left Udaipur, very helpful staff very understandable, highly attentive.  The Palace is more of a historic museum, staying there was like living a fairytale ....  much recommended for a luxury royal stay... a bit expensive but worth the money.  When you are there make sure you do the Hotel Tour it was a story to tell."
"Immaculate rooms. Outstanding shopping in the hotel. Gorgeous. Service is top notch and restaurants are fabulous. The attention to detail in every part of this hotel is second to none.  Great views of the Gateway to India and lots of small shops to browse in within walking distance. Be careful though, you cross streets at your peril. The traffic is atrocious."
"The attention to detail, the kindness of  staff, and the cleanliness and opulence of the hotel made for a most wonderful stay! Hotel staff made us feel particularly special on the occasion of my sister's birthday. We appreciated that when we informed the front desk that our room felt damp, they provided us with a number of options immediately. We had a very comfortable stay and enjoyed the use of all the amenities - recommend getting the club upgrade. The Heritage Walk is a nice touch."
"My first stay at the Taj Mahal Palace. I’ve previously stayed in their new annexe, Taj Mahal Towers. The heritage by contrast is beautiful as the hotel occupies a heritage building.   The check-in process was amazing and reflective of their attention to service. I landed in late into Mumbai and arrived at the hotel at 3am. Was greeted at the entrance as I disembarked from my car. Avoiding check-in counter the staff took me straight to my room and checked me in at the room.  The room itself is spacious and I’ve attached photos to see. Large, clean and spacious.   Highly recommend as they really make you feel at home."
"We had booked a Club Room which was Sea facing with a grand view of the Gateway of India, the rooms were lavishly some up and were one of the best suites that I have stayed in,   It was really a very nice stay, the property blew us over once again as it was our second stay here,   The Restaurants are very good, we dined at the Sea Lounge, Palace Lounge, The Souk and Masala Craft, food and hospitality was very good,  If u want to stay for a day or two and are celebrating some special occasion and want to have a nice get together with family then it’s a very good place to be at,   Also the hotel is a historic property with very nice heritage decor, one of the best hotels to stay in India for sure.  "
"We started our trip here. From the reception to check out is a masterclass of service.  The hotel sits across the road from the Gateway and our room looked out over the water.  Security is evident and reassuring as you enter the hotel itself and if you wish to go to a guest room area.   The pool area and restaurant is lovely with the quirky overhead  piano strings created a bird deterrent along with a man with a flag, but the birds are not a nuisance it just all adds to the charm. Fantastic numbers of restaurants, good spa and fitness center.   The room was a little tired, showing its age but the amenities and the bed, wifi , tv etc all fine.  For the room alone I would have given four blobs but everything else is five star all the way.  I would note that you are in a city and"
"I reviewed this hotel a few years back and my response was wow wow wow, it’s almost still wow wow wow, I go on my own now, I upgrade to Taj club because I love all the wee extras, I love being treated like a queen, I wrote on my Facebook page that I was off to my most favourite place in the world but!!!, I don’t make full use of breakfast, I don’t do soft drinks and tea or coffee all day in palace lounge, I don’t do high tea in palace lounge I don’t do chocolates and brandy in palace lounge but what I do do is the 6.00pm till 7.30pm cocktail hour, I loved the Bellini’s but no longer available, that’s ok, just but what I do object to I being made to feel like some cheap Spanish all inclusive where the bar man looks at you as though you are getting this all for free and can’t be"
"A trip to Mumbai to celebrate our 10th anniversary was made so much more special by our stay at the Taj. We were upgraded from the Tower to the Palace side, and had our room filled with little romantic surprises. We loved all the relaxing corners and and the  the restaurants we tried at breakfast..... Thank you for making it so memorable for us!"
Very nice of TAJ to upgrade us from the Tower to heritage building. The staffs were amazing and very helpful. The rooms were neat and spotless. The room service were really professional. The inroom amenities were exceptional compared to other Indian hotels. The breakfast had choices of three restaurants which you dont usually get to see anywhere else. Stay at TAJ has always been memorable and so this one.
"My wife and I were on a cruise from Dubai to Singapore with an overnight stay in Mumbai. As my wife was celebrating a special birthday we booked in for the night. The wonderful experience started at the Port Gate,where our limousine was parked. Our chauffeur in his white uniform and peaked cap drove us around the City for two hours.We then arrived at the Taj Palace entrance and were superbly treated. We had booked a Club Suite which was beautiful with a view of The Gate of India.Our room   had been decorated for my wife's  birthday and included a fabulous chocolate cake..The access to the Club Lounges was terrific,we had Afternoon Tea,but the real treat,after an excellent meal in the Indian Restaurant was the ""Cognac and Chocolates"" Breakfast was in a room overlooking the Gate"
"I stayed for two days in the Taj Tower and had a wonderful experience. My view of the sea was spectacular and I could never ask for anything more. Room service was very responsive, as was housekeeping.My only regret was that I could not stay longer. I would highly recommend the hotel tour, which I believe is given twice a day. You will be able to see areas you may otherwise not be privy to."
I was very excited to see the taj mahal hotel for the first time in my life. It made of full of old palace as look like the raja palace. Tea is very costly but it is very good in taste. I like the environment is full of air condition with good lighting.
"Location of the hotel is the best you can imagine. Near by there are many restaurants and small shops to taste the real street food of Mumbai. Taxi from airport takes around 1h15min - with the average traffic. View from the window is really worth the money! Room itself is not the biggest one, but it has all you need to spend a night in. Bed is very comfy too.  Swimming pool area is clean and nice to seat near by in the evening.  Staff is very polite and smiley.  Definitely we are coming back!"
"I’ve stayed at the Taj several times over the years and absolutely always loved it. There is no doubt it’s a magnificent hotel, although the restaurants are massively over priced and not very good when I’ve tried them!   On this occasion on check out I paid my 22,000 ruppees with my credit card only to find out a week later that they had converted to pounds without my authorisation . By doing this I’m given an awful exchange rate approx 88 ruppees to the pound instead of 94. Hence I ended up paying 6% more than my bill!   This is totally illegal under MasterCard legislation and is a known scam. Ive attached a statement from moneysavingexpert about the scam with a quote from MasterCard themselves . I’ve witnessed this scam in India at small places but for the Taj to be doing this"
The Taj hotel is for the luxury stay and the ambience is top guy good and the place is quite expensive but it's a valuable for  money and the food is great and the service is too good from the hotel staff 
No words to explain about the hospitality  which taj is providing.....such a true paradise it is..they are really empiring with the service excellence.....saw lot of negs.no way for negs.....completely worth it  stay
"Great stay in a great hotel superbly located. The Palace Wing is extraordinarily chic and impeccaby maintained. Service can be slow and is not personalized, but that is to be expected in such a large scale hotel. "
"This so called, 5 star, completely overpriced hotel is in dangerously polluted Mumbai. The atmosphere inside the hotel is unpleasant, some of the staff are rude and surly. The rooms are noisy. You have to queue for breakfast, be served by unfriendly staff using chipped glasses and delivering slow service. Don't expect a good night's sleep even with all the windows closed due to the noise. I don't regularly use trip advisor, but this hotel is a joke."
"The hotel is amazing. The room are very clean and comfortable. The hotel is spotless and the pool is fabulous. Great location, great building. It just oozes class and history. Staff (a lot of them!) are charming. The check-in process  is done efficiently. Also, breakfast is excellent, with a lot of interesting options and breakfast staff are so attentive.   My 2 main issues are, first of all, that the food in all of their restaurants is totally overpriced, so I didn’t eat in the hotel. Secondly, for all their willingness to help and charm, the concierges are not very good. I had 6 or 7 things I wanted to do in mumbai and I needed a bit of guidance on how to structure my days and I didn’t get any luck at all. Having said that, the hotel is really fabulous so it didn’t spoil my"
"There is lot of misinformation about the happy hours in a very beautiful hotel of REPUTE.  In the hotel room a message 'palace experiences' is kept in which it was mentioned that there would be happy hours from 19.00 hrs to 20.00 hrs live music at the Sea Lounge in the Taj Mahal Palace hotel but when we went to Sea Loungeby 7.15 p.m.  we were informed that there's no such happy hours in Sea lounge n that we should go to palace lounge in lobby which is one floor below.  We went there to be told that happy hours would be between 6 p.m. n 7p.m. n declined services.  We have been ardent fans of Taj hotels having stayed in  Taj phalaknuma palace, udaipur lake palace, jai Mahal palace, jaipur n several other properties. But disappointed n felt embarrassed.  "
"This place is just awesome. Superdeluxe and well situated. Service level is out of this world. Only in India. Good restaurants and bars, and also top class shopping for lux brands if you are into that stuff. Pool is great."
"So very quite in the heart of Mumbai.With all the hustle and bustle around this TAJ MAHAL,HARBOR ROOOM is so quite and richly decorated with traditional Indian with touch of modernity.Live music with a piano adds to this restaurant.Even though Taj mahal palace is one of the Top hotels in Mumbai The harbor room was not very expensive for à dinner,Atmosphere the surrounding,people,decor,soft live music, Facing the INDIA GATE through the windows "
The hotel was so comfortable and had great facilities but what made it even better was the amazing history that it had. The hotel was one in a terrorist attack many years ago which don’t worry had made their security incredibly tight. But I would highly suggest asking the staff for the historic heritage tour. It is right in front of the India gate meaning you get a great view of it. They have a gym and many different type of restaurants. I only stayed for one night however I experience their delicious Chinese restaurant and their barbecue menu outside. There breakfast selection is huge from the basic to the delicious dishes. They have a buffet and a hot food menu. Highly recommend this hotel.
"Staying in the Taj - is like beeing thrown to a different acient century and beeing treated like a princess and much more… I booked my second stay this year in the Taj - and got upgraded again - which was a huge surprise for me. wWen the lady at the receprtion told me this - I just said ""I love you guys!"" - having really watery eyes and smiling like a child :)  Thats the Taj - you are expecting to have a wonderful stay - but THEY will offer you always much more, than you expect or think about :)   I lived on the 5th floor of the palace in a club room - view was lovely to the pool side - and would always recommend it! The club rooms are very comfy and beautiful - with a lot of lovely detals in interior architecure and design. The room service, butlers and houskeeping, were as"
"When you stay at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai you feel like you are in the most important place in the city.   Stayed in the heritage wing which continues to marry old colonial Indian charm with all modern amenities.   Dinner at Masala Craft was excellent. You can have breakfast at two different places and we really liked the Sea Catch Restautant which has a view of the Gateway of India and the boats in the harbor.  The shopping in the Taj is fantastic, including Indian silver purveyor Ravisant where you can get Tiffany level silver at a fraction of the cost."
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai is the benchmark for hotels worldwide. The facilities, friendliness and attention given to detail from the staff is truly exceptional. It was an experience we will never forget. "
"Stayed 4 nights over NYE.  Stayed in the Palace: rooms were lovely, staff were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is very big so there is a lot of activity in the foyer.  Most of the hotels we stayed in were smaller and cosier. It was well located for the various activities we undertook. Children loved the pool."
"We had a great experience but this is a large hotel, with many tourists popping in and out, and the staff is too small to offer the same level of service we’ve had at other top hotels (like Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur). Modern feel, not much charm.  Staff we dealt with were excellent but unlike the Lake Palace or other smaller hotels, we only encountered staff when we sought them out."
"We had a delightful tea and cakes with a lovely view over the gateway of India and the sea. Excellent service, nice selection of cakes, we were left to chat with no pressure to move on. I think it is a lovely break from the sheer mayhem of outside, two worlds very far apart"
"The entire experience of the 116 year old monument is surreal. The decor, the grandeur and the service by every staff is unforgettable. An experience of a lifetime. The original paintings from the most celebrated artists and the antique furniture makes you feel that you are living in a museum. The view of the harbour and the fireworks at 12 midnight makes the entire experience priceless."
"The Stay at the Hotel was very Comfortable, with the excellent Ambience,Hospitality and Food cooked to your needs at the 24 Hours coffee shops. The proximity of the Hotel to the Gateway of India is the greatest advantage.You can visit the area an time as you wish. From the airport the route to this Hotel  follows the Marine Drive and the Bandra worli Sea link ,which is also great. The Colaba Causeway is also at a walking distance with great Bombay Street Food and hops of all categories. A must visit."
"My wife and I have been fortunate to stay in many top class hotels throughout the world over the past years, and can say that this is undoubtedly the best we have stayed in. The service, the staff, the facilities, the rooms and the food in all the restaurants is simply outstanding. The Taj Palace is definitely somewhere we both will look forward to coming back to."
"Arrived tired and weary from a flight from Heathrow at 3.30 in the morning.  Staff could not have been kinder or more helpful, whisking our luggage to our room whilst we completed the minimum of formality.   Visually, it is a sight to behold - long flowing corridors, immaculate communal areas and sumptuous bedrooms.  Nothing is left to chance - so many staff at your discrete beck and call.  So many restaurants to choose from and such glorious food.  An absolute delight to stay here! A very short walk away is the thriving hubbub which is the ‘Gateway to India’, a tourist spot everyone has to visit but once inside the Taj, it is a completely different world of old India. A must on everyone's bucket list!"
"The Palace wing is indeed an architectural masterpiece, but what makes this hotel stand out is the stellar service that one experiences at this establishment. Every aspect is par excellence right from the airport pickup to check in, and as a guest at the hotel. "
"This hotel totally lives up to its reputation as one of the world’s best! It’s just such an experience to stay here and be treated like a guest of old times. The hotel is immaculate, beautiful and with so much heritage that is celebrated. It is a quiet and tranquil oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Mumbai.   There are coffee shops, markets and restaurants in the quaint streets of the Colaba district surrounding the hotel (try colaba social for a cheap and cheerful breakfast!) and the Colaba street markets are fun! The hotel is also an attraction in itself with so many areas to explore and lots of history to uncover.   We loved the afternoon high tea (complete with street food delights we would not have tried from vendors on the street), cocktail hour and delicious"
"This was my second attempt to stay at this Iconic hotel, I had booked to travel here in March when Jet Airways collapsed so could not stay, the hotel was very helpful and accommodating so I re booked for November this year with friends. We booked club rooms facing the Gate way of India on the 5 & 6 floors. On arrival at Mumbai Airport our chauffeur drivers were waiting for us and looking very smart. They collect our luggage and took us to our transport. On arrival at the hotel you pass through security and are taken to your rooms where you are checked in, the staff were very helpful and informative. The rooms were amazing with awesome views. our butler introduced himself he then advised us what our package included. I was amazed afternoon tea. Early evening cocktails and canapes"
"Super welcome 5 star all the way you feel like celebrity!! When arriving. Club room spacious and so clean, staff amazing nothing to much trouble. Love this hotel been before and will continue to visit & stay as long as able too. "
"A great trip with the Saga Louts through Rajastan ending with the Taj Mahal. Great sights, good friendly crowd on the tour,  a brilliant guide Lav and a fantastic finish. We saw many aspects of India, from Delhi to places that have not changed in centuries."
"We stayed at the palace wing  Best thing 1) Staff were excellent (minus the reception) and were always there to help you no matter what you asked for. Special shoutout and huge thank you to house keeping and butler services for the most amazing and great service 2) Amazing and the best location 3) Super comfy beds, slept like a baby  Where it failed 1) Food was average at best 2) There is no shower curtain in the bath tub so bathroom gets flooded after the shower. Polish your swimming skills, might be helpful when you want to use bathroom later ;-). There is no separate shower area so you have to use the bath tub  3) Staff at reception were grumpy, maybe bit overwhelmed due to the size of crowd which was there for a wedding event at the hotel. I would rather use a kiosk to"
"We did not stay at Taj but, just went there for a cup of coffee at 4 in the morning!  The hotel no doubt is one of the most beautiful hotels in India. The staff were also very polite and friendly.  Had a great time there with Christmas decorations still on."
Was in Mumbai for a wedding and was blessed enough to stay at The Taj for a few nights. Truly has the air of a historic great hotel and the staff match that expectation by being so polite and knowledgeable. Delicious breakfast too. Overall great.
"All the way it was a superb stay.  One issue is about the paucity of rest rooms on the Reception floor level needs immediate attention for the in-house guests. Since in this floor there are restaurants and shopping arcade, the resident guests are inconveniences by the flowing visitors."
Stayed only 3 nights in Mumbai and am glad I chose this hotel. Excellent service. I booked 2 tours though the hotel and both had excellent guides. Also booked the airport pick up to the hotel and everything went very smooth. I would certainly book this hotel again. 
"We have seen many buildings during all the trips we had but this one is by far the most amazing we have ever seen. It's already a great experience to travel to agra   and enter the Taj. We were very lucky with the weather.  Clear sky, no fog. Great experience  and THE number one reason to visit Delphi."
"This magnificent hotel with its air of grandeur is coupled with amazing service.  Our wedding anniversary was made into an unforgettable experience and a special thanks must go to Rahul Singh, Nitin Huddah and Kevin, and Ashutosh More."
"The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai is magnificent and conveniently situated in the City by the Gateway and the Arabian Sea.  Every inch of the hotel is exquisite.  There are various restaurants, all excellent, and the finest stores for shopping. There is an array of interesting art and artifacts throughout the hotel and also art of museum quality.  Even the lobby is beautifully appointed with inlay floor squares, beautiful carpeting and bright blue lamps with peacock feather design.  The art on the wall behind the reception is gorgeous and is explained in the tour. There is a most gorgeous pool where I enjoyed breakfast and a late afternoon swim.  It was very peaceful. I also had breakfast at the Sea Lounge with a view of the gate of India and the sea. I enjoyed the hotel tour of"
"I stayed previously at this hotel, Must have experience, The location is really good & service is exceptional , The staff is really prompt and the food is also very good. the pool area is clean. Thankyou"
"I would specially like to thank Ms. Fauscina, from the Souk restaurant. I have planned a lunch date for my brother and his to be wife with few idea in my mind to make it special. Ms. Fauscina in all the aspects helped me out so well with all the courtesy planning arrangements, rates , menu .. and all my expectations were fullfilled by her. She made sure, whatever I imagined about the lunch for them was achieved.  Kudos to Fauscina and the whole Souk team..  The Taj Mahal Palace and their employees always make sure that the standards are maintained.  Trust me its value for money."
"Our two nights in Mumbai were the beginning of our visit to India and were treated like royalty. Our visit was seamless from our arrival to departure. We arranged for a sea-facing view room on the concierge level and were happily upgraded to the Primrose Suite which was even more amazing! The staff at this hotel are world-class and guests are pampered beyond belief. The service standards in the United States do lag behind the five-star hotels in India. This is classic ""old-fashioned"" service like most Americans have never experienced. The concierge arranged for two sightseeing tours--Mumbai by Dawn and a four hour city tour. We are glad that we did both--especially the Mumbai by dawn which gave a close up look at the local fish and food markets.  This is a hotel where"
"This is the third or fourth time we went to Souk restaurant in Taj Palace Hotel, Apollo Bunder, Mumbai. The first time, many years ago, was a wonderful experience. The last two times were disappointing, with the food being over indianised.  The most recent one was better than the previous occasions. However, they did not have the Adani beer even though it was listed in the menu. The pizza was fantastic. So was the rose petal ice cream. The other dishes were interesting. The ambience is good, but a wee bit dark for a family outing. The view must be splendid during the day; nothing much to write home at night."
I stayed a few nights in the Taj Palace part of the hotel (see my next review of tower part) and it was a great experience from start to finish. The staff were excellent and the room was great (I see many are better than the one I stayed in from the images posted though). Still I can't complain although of course you pay for it. Luxury does not come cheap. It is worth it once in a while! Nice touches were the flower petal designs left on  the floor of my room each evening and I loved the breakfasts in the Sea Lounge Restaurant which brought back memories of the colonial times as the ambience was more traditional than modern. The only issue I had was with the toilet on two occasions. The water would not stop running (ball-cock stuck?) and then there was no water at all. Both
"Had a lovely high tea at the Taj overlooking the Gateway of India with a view by the window.   It was busy, so if you are going, I would suggest getting a table for about 3pm. Tea starts at 330pm.   Food on offer is to the highest standard with tea on tap and a great selection of hot food, sandwiches and cakes.   My only issue was service was a little slow but I think this was due to a number of large group in the day we visited.   Would certainly recommend at 2500 rps per person. Sit and enjoy the atmosphere of this lovely old hotel which is quintessentially Indian. After tea have a walk around the hotel, it is steeped in history with amazing decor. Enjoy. "
Iconic building....must stay here!! Amazing staff.....Taj has also rooted with Indian way to welcome guest...greeted with tulsi mala and tilak at the time of arrival. Given a small tocken as good wishes and good luck on departure!! 
"I originally got a room in the Taj Mahal tower. Walked in and immediately had to pay for an upgrade. The tower is realllly cheap feeling. The other side of the hotel, in the palace, you can actually feel like you are in India. The room was very small but infinitely better than the tower side. It cost me almost 3x as much per night but it was a must. Also the noise from the Colaba Causeway and Gateway to India was crazy loud starting at 530am. Definitely bring earplugs!!"
I had a great experience in Taj the people and aurora over there is irreplaceable none of the 5 stars can match that great food the service is great the people are polite I order chicken chasseur the chicken was well cooked dope experience
"Went here for my 60th birthday. I just love this place and have done for over 30 years. The location, staff, facilities and accommodation is amazing. I would choose to stay here above everywhere else. "
Lovely stay at Taj Mahal palace.Great hospitality by the staff.Food and ambience was excellent.Room arrangements made for our anniversary was enthralling.A warm welcome on arrival was the most memorable one
We enjoyed our stay at TAJ. The Staff was so courteous and helpful. The breakfast was excellent. The rooms were keot very neat and clean and spacious for two people. The inhouse hotels for Lunch and Dinner was exemplary and enjoyed the dishes.
"Usually, I do not write reviews, but the beauty of this place is different, a moment spent with family is very pleasing here. The food and services here are the most different and the best, I hope that once you give this place a chance to serve you, and even then, you will not forget this place. Thanks"
"First off the tower is an eyesore and a blemish on the Mumbai skyline. Hotel is nice, but I was left with a few questions. We booked rooms in the historical palace wing and thought there'd be a bit more difference between the two properties. I have not seen the rooms in the tower wing, but form what I understand both properties share all facilities so I can't figure out why we paid so much more to stay in the historical wing.  Car drop off is at the tower wing regardless of where you are staying,  exiting he palace wing there is no sidewalk to walk on, you literally have to walk on the street and hope not to get run over.  There is also nowhere to sit in the palace wing lobby so you end up having to use the tower wing lobby.  That being said, our room and bathroom were nice and"
"We had a great driver Dharmender he’s was knowledgeable of places of interest.he said the car is your for 5 days we can go anywhere. If we wanted him after he dropped us of at hotel just said to ring him he would be there. We had a great time with Dharmender would recommend him, Thanks again for a wonderful 5days."
"Lovely hotel with a great staff team. Easy check in done in the room. Our room was on the 4th floor. Large bedroom and bathroom. Well appointed furnishings. The best cotton sheets ever!  We really loved the room service. As soon as we used a towel it was replaced. Great toiletries. Worth joining the historic tour of the hotel to get a greater sense of the history. The bar and restaurant by the pool is super. The Souk restaurant was lovely Lebanese food although pricey of course. Great location and easy to travel to and from the airport. Local taxi 1200 rupees, Taj Palace chauffeur driven car approx 5700 rupees.Take your pick!"
"Stayed here for a couple of days. Service was incredible- from check in to check out. Got a room in the Tower Wing with a wonderful sea view. Rooms were fairly small though and adequately furnished. Bathroom was fairly small though and toiletries selection was quite limited.   Nice touches with the little gifts Everyday and one of the best shoeshines!  Great gym as well, although a bit of a trek.   "
"I had done my research on the Taj Hotel.From the moment we arrived we were treated with so much kindness,the staff are amazing they really love their jobs and the Hotel ..It really was a lovely experience .We eat in Shamina on two occasions it as so good..it is a real escape from the noise of the Mumai streets.The location is great as you can literally cross the road to the Gateway, and from here you can take the ferry to the Elephanta caves..Cafe Leopold is just around the corner and great place to have food and coffee.If I ever come back to Mumbai I Will be staying here.."
Taj mahal is a best place in our country.. This is a historical place our country....... Taj mahal built ago. Minimum age in 200years above... So I played this place. AND Enjoyable place in India. I love my india.
"Absolutely fantastic place to stay the hotel and rooms are beautiful, the staff can't do enough for you they cater for our every need to me this is pure luxury, we will definitely come back as soon as we possibly can thank you everyone.they really spoilt my husband as it was his birthday he had cake balloons flowers smellies "
I really felt like a princess living in a real palace! The hotel interiors and the services and staff and hotel facilities! The only downside is I wish I stayed more than 4 nights to spend more time enjoying the hotel facilities.
"Stunning historical landmark building, wonderfully maintained, superbly located. It's like stepping into a bygone era of elegance and style. Superb service matches the splendor of the setting. It might all be overwhelming, but the staff are so gracious and kind that you instantly feel comfortable and relaxed. Not sure I've experienced anything quite like it."
"Just nothing like it. Utterly incredible, literally the best hotel experience we have had. My wife’s 50th Birthday was made special by staff at the Taj. We will be back definitely. There are some fantastic hotels in Mumbai. Nothing like this though."
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Taj Palace. We travel extensively and it would be safe to say this was the best hotel we have ever stayed in from the moment we checked in until we were dropped off at the airport. Apart from the stunning rooms and architecture and decor of the hotel the staff were incredible. It's the little things that make a difference a book mark for a book, cleaning cloth for glasses, flower petals in the hallway. Staff remember you name and room number and always anticipate your needs without being over bearing. The food was incredible we ate at wasabi and souk and will forever remember our meals. Little gifts on arrival and departure with explanations of their meaning, I literally cried when we had to leave. Will certainly stay again if we are lucky"
We stayed in lovely room 252 for several nights. We had a wonderful view of the Gateway of India. The staff was wonderful - Arshi was particularly helpful (and beautiful). There are very nice shops in the hotel. The flowers displayed all over the hotel are really beautiful. Avocado toast at breakfast was fabulous. I would definitely stay here again if I ever return to Mumbai. Just don’t walk around the hotel area - I was not very comfortable. 
"We stayed for one week in this establishment and were quite disappointed.   We booked a suite where the proportions of the rooms were quite interesting, the bedroom large and the sitting area a cubby hole even smaller which made it quite difficult to sit in.   The rooms are very old with dirty carpets and the entertainment system non existent and old.   Room service most probably the slowest in the world.   Laundry service,concierge and housekeeping were good.   The duty manager Gaurav Salian is a professional and very helpful.   I don’t think we will re visit this establishment until they upgrade and become a world competitive Hotel. A historically site not being properly used in my opinion. "
"This was the first time, I stayed in the Hotel and was looking forward too. An Iconic Hotel. Very High Priced. There was nothing WOW. The Rooms of the Tower was just OK. Comparable to any 5 star Hote in Mumbai. Too much noise from the Road. Overall It never felt as, one has felt different."
everything was fine from check in to check out was fine except the shamiana was over crowded and had to wait for 45 min. for breakfast and my taj experience voucher of Rs. 500 was not given at the time of check in
"We visited the Taj Mahal and it was amazing. Our guide Nadeem Khan at the west gate made the tour even better. Not only was he very knowledgeable and spoke good English, his photography skills left us with beautiful pictures. Get Nadeem as a guide. He's well worh it."
"We are still simply astounded at the level of service and pampering we experienced during our too brief stay. It is expensive but so very worth it. There is nothing useful I may add except take the tour, and to be awoken on Sunday by the Indian Navy Band as an alarm clock was a wonderful, unforgettable moment we will cherish forever!  We loved the bathrobes, but they need replaced more frequently. The loose, flexible weave is damaged too easily."
"Iconic property stands low on cleanliness. Linen was old and worn out, drapery was not clean and low quality. Loose furniture was not maintained and upholstery work was cheap. Hairdryer in bathroom was very old with melted plastic and sticky surface. Towels were old. Swimming pool was not temperature controlled. No kids pool for families travelling with toddlers. Lobby was over crowded and unmanageable. With a room rate of more than $600per night it's definitely not worth the value."
"The location, service and facilities of the hotel are fantastic. I've never had such a good service in an hotel in my life. The staff antecipates all our wishes. And the atmosphere of the hotel is breathtaking..."
"Excellent service and facilities. The property is extremely well maintained, the room was well appointed and comfortable, breakfast and dinner were beyond reproach, it is hard to think of a better experience."
"Taj Mumbai was the final stop in a brilliant trip around India.  Did not think I could be so wowed, but I was. Fabulous hotel in a brilliant location.  Probably a bit overpriced, but a truly memorable stay. "
I was totally awestruck seeing the Taj Mahal from a distance (with amazing guide Farid) but up close was breath taking from every angle and the story that goes with it which I'd not known...the simitry needs to be seen to be believed ...a must on anyones travel list
This was the last night of our Riviera travel holiday ‘Heart of England by luxury train’ and what an amazing end to a superb experience.  We paid the upgrade to the old wing and - boy was it worth it. This is real luxury with great care taken to every detail. ( the petal design laid out for us while we were at dinner was the icing on the cake!!). With a variety of restaurants and shops you would hardly need to leave this amazing hotel if it want for the draws of Mumbai!! The staff seem capable of solving any problem and I can not praise them enough! I would certainly stop here again if the opportunity ever arises!
A great Place I have ever seen in my Life it made my day I wish you to go with your family and enjoy the way u love. Most beautiful place for Couples and Lovers I must say you people will enjoy a lot that's for Sure.
"The Taj Mahal Palace, right next to the Gateway of India, has a reputation as one of the most de luxe places to stay in India. I haven't been to all of the de luxe places of course, but I've seen a lot of India and the Taj in Mumbai carries it off well. The rooms are superbly appointed, the staff are great and everything is run super smoothly and efficiently. When I'd bought some books, the room service left book marks on top of them. A very nice touch. Great light switches clearly marked and all working. I've been to so many Indian hotels where you just can't find the light switches and half of them don't work! Breakfasts are delicious, but in the palace part, there are often queues to get in. The gardens and pool are lovely. It really is a special place to stay. But pricey."
Excellent stay! Great rooms! Lots of old world charm in these rooms with th decor especially. Feels like a palace! Great service and housekeeping! The butlers were amazing! The breakfast sumptuous! Enjoyed every moment. Highly recommended. 
"We have been staying at the Taj Mahal Tower hotel in Mumbai for the past 9 days. This is our third stay at this property. While our work and vacations have enabled us to travel all over the world and stay at some of the best hotels, the Taj Mahal Tower hotel continues to stand out for its exceptional staff and service. For example, the morning staff (Azar, Magalhaes, Vaibhav, Divyesh, Krishna,Tara and sous-chef Rahul at the Shamiana restaurant) are consistently attentive to our preferences and needs. They introduced us each day to special Indian delicacies and provided us with historical information that showed their level of expertise and training about the Taj Mahal hotel and its architecture. Other staff members especially Suyesh and Swapnil in housekeeping are friendly and"
We visited the taj for a meal. Just walking into the foyer is an experience beyond belief. The hotel is exquisite. The corridors and toilets are lovely. The food was excellent . The staff on the desk and in the restaurant were all gentlemen . Excellent service . 
"The service at this hotel is awesome, I would like to mention that Ms. Shikha was very helpful in arranging birthday surprises for my friend,she is very courteous. I would like to recommend this hotel to my friends and relatives."
"After a stay at the Oberoi hotel in Shimla, and the Leela Palace in Delhi, we booked a last minute one night stay at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai. As such, we had very high expectations of the Taj Palace, however we felt that the hotel delivered the lowest quality of service, food and room facilities.   Service Upon entering the hotel, we noticed immediately that there was no one standing by the entrance to guide guests to the reception. Although this is a minor point, it was noticeable after our recent stays at the other luxury hotels. Once we got to the reception desk, the team member did welcome us with a garland and tikka at the end of the desk, however this felt forced and performed as an afterthought. One of their team showed us to our room, however she looked bored and"
..Thanks To The Wonderful team at Mahal..  I had booked stay for anniversary and the team turned all stones to make my stay wonderful.. Simply had not dreamt about it.. It was our 10th wedding anniversary when we entered the room it has red carpet we felt like king and queen.. nice flower and ballon on decor.. Team had framed our best moments in journey of life.. I thank each and every team member over there special thanks to team house keeping who did such lovely set up.. I can't Miss mentioning Mr Arindam D who met me on arrival and made sure our stay was comfortable and all needs were taken care.. It's like a never ending Saga.. Taj group is now our second home.. Thank you for creating such wonderful memories.. Taj Rocks.. Mumbai Tigers Of Taj
"Our return to the Taj Mahal Palace was long awaited, and better than imagined.  This time, rather than the Tower, we chose rooms in the Palace Wing for the grandeur and to be immersed in the heritage.  Our city view was of a rooftop garden and leafy view beyond, and we relaxed in the quiet, the spacious accommodations, and perfect service.  Our choice of thalis from all over India served in Masala Kraft was flawless, to be honest.  We often relaxed in the Palace Lounge, served with every preference recalled and every selection fulfilled by Salman.  Our rooms were cared for by Prathmesh, who kept everything up to the Taj standards.  So, if you are conflicted by the Tower vs. the Palace Wing, both are excellent, but the Palace is not to me missed.  If you must, save before you go"
"We were treated like royalty at the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai. The stay was absolutely fantastic, with impaccable service and the highest quality of housekeeping. Our room at the palace wing was wonderful, with a beautiful view to the ocean and gate of India. The level of overall cleanliness and food hygiene is high, which is a top priority. The surrounding areas are great for shopping and just wandering around. I would come back to Mumbai just for this hotel!"
"I was on a 4-day trip to Mumbai and I was there shopping for my wedding.   I had a dream of having breakfast/ dinner with my family in The Taj Mahal Palace from my childhood. On the 4th day in Mumbai ( i.e 16th Nov 2019), I decided to go to The Taj Mahal Palace after spending some time in the Gateway of India.  I was going for breakfast so, I decided to enquire about Shamania about the reservation of the table. The customer service informed me that there is no reservation option available for Shamiana and it is actually ""First Come, First Serve"" Basis. I thought that's perfectly good.  When I tried to enter the Shamiana, that's when the drama begins.  1. First, he asked me what is the purpose of going to Shamiana. I told him that I'm here for breakfast. He then looked at my"
"This is the most stunning and opulent hotel I have ever stayed at. The service, staff, atmosphere and surrounds are immaculate and so beautiful. A most wonderful stay and everything was superb. Book the Club facilities and make the most of the early check-in and late check-out."
Well Taj is Taj!! Right from our pick up to our see off everything was just there!!!  What service What food What staff Their courtesy is unmatchable!! Beat it!! Thank you for the lovely room decor and birthday cake. Special and a memorable birthday IT WAS!!!
"Bin to Taj Mahal palace in oct 2019 with family, the hotel is huge and located right in front of india gate, rooms service was good, swimming pool area is amazing, huge lobby nice welcome in arrival, breakfast spread is huge, but had little issue with service in morning breakfast restaurant and roof top restaurant. Otherwise overall experience was great, love to stay again"
"Visited in November and estates for 3 nights before venturing off to mid India on tiger safaris.  One of the best 5 Stat hotels I stayed in. Wife range of food on offer, and spa treatments available which were very nice.  Pool was very relaxing after a day sight seeing in Mumbai.  Lovely little touches by housekeeping like tidying your phone charger cables with a velcro tie which not other hotels wouldnt think of.  Can't really stay much more than it was amazing."
"One of the best experience of hospitality and customer service. We stayed 9-11 Nov with toddler, servic One of the best experience of hospitality and customer service. We stayed b/w 9-11 Nov with toddler, service from the enter ance gate to the check out is seamless, well organised.  Internal communication is at best, no stuff up of orders or instructions which we had at St Regis.  Taj staff made experience worth the stay there.  Naming a few Arshi (Ground Staff),Gowdy / Goydi (Food Service), Sudha (housekeeping),Rajesh & Gaurav (Butler Service), Arzaan B. @ Front Desk.  Each of everyone did their best, don't know if their personality or training but they been great throughout dealing when we had interaction.  Small to big maintenance was done promptly, can't fault or complaint"
"Located right across the street from Gateway of India, this place offers great views and great food in a very fancy atmosphere.   We had lunch at the Sea Lounge, which served street food that we had tried before and loved. Prices are reasonable given the very high-quality service.  "
"We had the fortune of visiting The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, which is a heritage, five-star, luxury hotel and situated next to the Gateway of India. The hotel has been on my bucket list since long. Its doors opened to guests on 16 December 1903.  It is widely believed that Jamsetji Tata decided to build the hotel after he was refused entry to one of the city's grand hotels of the time, Watson's Hotel, as it was restricted to ""whites only"". However, this story has been challenged by many commentators who suggest that Tata was most unlikely to have been concerned with 'revenge' against his British adversaries. Instead, they suggest that the Taj was built at the urging of editor of The Times of India who felt a hotel ""worthy of Bombay"" was needed."
It was so attractive place as per its architecture. So we decided to go to the coffee shop.we went to visit gateway of India. We were with hand luggage: Anyway we walked to the hotel after going to gateway of India. It was about 3 min walk.  When we ask from the receptionist at hotel they directed us to this place.It was like a restaurant instead of a coffee house or shop.  
Great Experience.All services were satisfactory.Staff was polite.Food was awesome.Room was clean and overall experience was Excellent .Check in and was check out was so easy & no waiting. Value for money
"Not only is this hotel luxurious, it is in a great location. It overlooks the Arabian Sea, and the Mumbai Gateway monument. It is also close to the shopping and market area. The staff are attentive and professional, nothing is too much trouble. The room is large and comfortable, as is the bed. A truly great hotel."
I stayed in this hotel a few years ago for a long weekend while visiting Mumbai; a truly exquisite experience!  I live in Mumbai now and still love to go to the Taj for afternoon tea or drinks. It’s like stepping into a delicious tasting past. The view from the window adds to the delight.   You can go in casual dress; but it adds to the experience to be dressed up a wee bit. 
"Had a fantastic short stay at The Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai. Full marks to the management for the upkeep of this 115 year old property. Every part of the hotel is well maintained, and refurbished. The hotel has this unique inviting ambiance. This is my 4th stay at this property and I perhaps will come back again. Brilliant location. Room was well appointed. Many food options, all good and all expensive, but worth a try."
"I have spent a Night in Taj, It was another Level of Luxury that I have seen. Best Part of the Taj is ""Sea View"" Rooms, Waking Up in Front of Ocean and Gateway is a Dream Come True.  Fort Area is Porche, Clean and Blooming with Crowd even at 0300 Hrs"
Luxury at your command! I have been coming back here since last 30 years. Every time it has been better than the last stay! My favorite is sitting out next to the pool side! Pleasure to be an Inner Circle member!
"Iconic hotel with superb reputation which it tries to live upto. In general it succeeds. Beware the windowless rooms!  The food was good but not outstanding and the service was very good. Great location and history, reccomend the heritage tour goven by a staff member."
"We stayed here for 3 nights and I can safely say this hotel is the best in so many areas: discreet first class service, cleanliness, pride, professionalism etc etc worth staying in the Palace vs Tower. Breakfast in The Sea Lounge is so relaxing and delicious. They have 3 great restaurants: Indian, Lebanese and Chinese... we were only able to try the Indian restaurant but that was first class... try the vegetarian food (said from a meat lover)... really tasty! Will return!!"
Excellent hotel.  Very easy check in.  Location of hotel is great.  Would definitely recommend when in Mumbai.  The gym was also very nice and the choice of restaurants was extensive and the room very comfortable.
The beat of hotels.stunningly beautiful.flFood.Romm.Service.Smell all just amazing.I travel the world n this is up there in my top three.In fact number 1.The pool.area.is.spotless.The staff fantastic and many imported foods at the breakfast buffet.If I had to complain I didnt like the bacon!
"We stopped by the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel bar for a drink before dinner and had a very enjoyable experience. The drinks were delicious and the service was exceptional. Whilst it is more expensive than other bars in the area, it is a great opportunity to spak up the atmosphere and we felt that it was good value."
A short visit to this hotel is a must .  Enjoy a laffe beer with pizza in shamiana their 24 hours cafe.take some pics in the grand lobby and then take a stroll through the shopping arcade . The joy shoe store and the silver ware shop is worth a visit .  
"A great stay at a superb hotel with professional and super kind staff especially the concierge staff. My daughter and I stayed at the Taj Mahal Hotel for four nights. The beauty and cleanliness and hotel service were top notch. If you are traveling to Mumbai, Taj Mahal Hotel will be great for you"
"Incredible hotel, restaurants, amazing executive lounge with outstanding service.  I have to thank all the staff for their care, kindness and attention to detail, but in particular 3 people helped to make the stay in Taj Krishna extra special.   First and foremost, the beautiful Annie in the guest relations team in the lounge. As my husband was on business in Hyderabad, She went out of her way to ensure I was comfortable and organised an Uber to take me to an Ayurvedic spa which I had wanted to visit. She even phoned the spa to check I was ok. She is a delight.  Mohammad Shahid is the Asst Butler Operations Manager and with Ranjan Jaiswal made sure we were served the food and drink we enjoyed. They even made me a special Indian tea as I had expressed interest in it.   I left a"
"According to Indian Sarais Act, 1867 any individual can ask for water free of charge from any hotel at any time for themselves and their pets. Furthermore, he or she can use the washroom for free, and no one can stop them.It is your right to demand water from any hotel at any time. There was a security person who was very rude time around 0030hrs 16th nov 2019"
"Pampered from the moment we stepped into the hotel. Immaculate bedrooms and bathroom. Breakfast was picturesque, overlooking the Gate to India and the sea. Food was marvellous.  A very special thanks goes to Husain Mohammad who went the extra mile to help my husband celebrate his birthday and to Ankita Bhatt who helped us settle in. In fact, a very big  Thank You  to all the staff who helps make this Hotel so outstanding. I salute every member.. Wel Done to everyone at the Taj"
You have to visit to appreciate just how good this hotel is. The attention to detail is second to none. We have visited the hotel on many occasions since 2015 and every visit has been an absolute joy! Stay in the Palace Wing and let Mahtaab and her team look after you. Make sure to take the Heritage Walk. It is a fascinating insight into the history of this iconic hotel.
"We had the best hospitality experience in Mumbai. The hotel has the best Mumbai location and is situated opposite the Gate of India.  We had the most comfortable and relaxing stay in Taj, it was an amazing experience!"
"A destination in itself....we got a driver and guide (Sajid) whom were amazing.  The hotel is just super in every aspect....we did not want to leave after 5 nights!  The Spa, restaurants, bar, pool, staff were all incredible and without fault!  We used the steam rooms in the Quite Gym everyday!  From Check in to Check out was a delight and treat.   GOOD VALUE!  TREAT YOURSELF!"
This was my first short visit to this property and found great hospitality ... will come again with family . Every thing was superb.property is just opposite of India gate and sea facing.. I love to stay with Taj properties
From initial welcome to morning of departure we experienced superlative service from all members of staff.  Club level is good value with afternoon tea including hot food. In the evening happy hour  from 6 to 7:30 again includes hot food with canapes and good selection of alcoholic drinks.  Breakfast in the main restaurant consists of a wide variety of hot and cold foods to suit all tastes. Swimming pool can get busy in the afternoon but plenty of. vacant sunbeds in the morning - no reserving with towels allowed as unattended towels on sunbeds removed after 20 mins. Pool staff very attentive and provide cold water throughout the day. This was not our first visit and we are returning late December to further enjoy yet another stay at the Taj.
Wonderful stay at the Palace!!  Every detail was excellent - simply cant understand the tiny handful of reviewers that give this place only one star - bizarre!! Unrivalled piece of history for India with the Brits leaving through the Gate of India back in 1948. High tea was quaint and fun in the Sea Lounge starting from 3.30pm. Some good shops although I had some shirts made up in <24 hours by Kings just round the back of the hotel - the tailor and owner Sunny was fantastic and recommend him. Tour of the hotel was good and nothing seemed too much trouble - well done to the GM and I believe about his 2000 staff!!!
"As part of our 25th wedding Anniversary we decided to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace and were blown away by the whole experience. The hotel is outstanding from the warm welcome we received when we arrived to the time we had to leave. The service we received from the front desk staff, porters, house keeping staff was exceptional and with a smile ,they could not do enough for you to the point were they would sometime leave small gifts in the room (ie indian scarfs ,and array of flowers etc) ....amazing.We did a tour of the hotel taking in the incredible décor and the guide giving us a history of the hotel.The swimming pool area is stunning were you can order drinks and food plus other restaurants which can sometimes be a little pricey but great quality as you would expect. Breakfast"
"We had booked a 3N stay at the Sea View-Taj Mahal Tower. Our welcome was very warm-a traditional aarti with tikka and a tulsi necklace for good health. The Taj graciously offered us a complimentary free upgrade to the Sea View-Heritage Palace wing. The much larger rooms at the Palace offered unobstructed views of the Arabian sea and the Gateway.  The interiors were intricate, luxurious and resplendent. Those spectacular chandeliers are a visual delight. The swimming pool was large and spotless clean.   The complimentary breakfast at The Sea Lounge and Shamiana was elaborate offering expansive menu offerings of veg and non veg, with specially brewed filter coffee. Piping hot dosas (masala, podi), pooris, streaming idlis, fluffy cheese masala omlettes will satiate your salivating"
"The hotel location is outstanding. The upkeep of a 115 year hotel is outstanding, GREAT to see how rooms are so contemporary. Staff is very helpful and polite. Many food options, expensive but good. Concierge gave good itinerary to visit South Mumbai. "
"Every morning I was delighted to wake up and enjoy the fantastic Buffett with an all star service. Ershad always convinced me to try to dosa and I was never let down. Thanks Ershad for teaching me about the local cuisine of India. You're very professional and great to talk with whenever I found myself alone at breakfast. Besides the buffet, I also really enjoyed the shops on the ground floor. I had a few shirts costume tailored and created at Maharaja's. It was also the first place that I tried on silk shirts which changed the way I felt about clothing. They made me feel like a king and now I have 4 new shirts and 4 new pants that I'll remember forever."
Hotel Taj Mahal Palace Colaba is very Elegant Marvellous Ultra Luxurious Heritage Hotel just opp to Gateway of India It was amazing experience THE TAJ Mahal Palace Hotel is truly finest hotels and really very touchy to see Jamsetji Tata A man who gave India the Best of Hotels with full World Class facilities
"I was in Mumbai for a night and was initially booked at the sister property (albeit poorer), the President, however they were sold out and bounced me to the Taj Mahal. I couldn’t have been happier! Check in was smooth and I was allotted a room in the tower wing. The rooms are smallish but very comfortable. My room was overlooking the Gateway of India. I couldn’t have asked for anything better! They aren’t the newest rooms but they’ve been superbly maintained! Top marks to the housekeeping team there! I was quite sick the during my one night stay. At breakfast even though it was very busy, I was well looked after. My server (I wish I had noted his name) ensures that i got multiple refills of ginger and lemon tea. The spread was wonderful, unfortunately I just didn’t have the"
"Loved the hotel, the people, the way we were treated, all the hotel offerings.  Had the best butler, Rakesh Vaish.  Sea Lounge was our favorite location for breakfast.  Had an excellent dinner at Souk.  Bought some lovely gifts in the hotel shops.  An all-around wonderful stay."
"It’s hard to know where to start. This would have to be the best hotel I have ever stayed in. It’s just breathtakingly beautiful inside and out. The architecture, attention to detail, the history, the flowers, the shops. This is a hotel with a big heart. The staff are amazing. The food sensational. We stayed in a suite in the Palace. It’s really expensive but a once in a lifetime experience. A stay here should be on your bucket list. If you want to know what truly delighting your customers mean come here. Do the tour at 3.30 every day. Eat the Indian food at breakfast. Nothing will disappoint. "
"Wow, what can I say. This hotel is simply amazing. The staff are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble and they are so friendly and helpful. The restaurants are amazing, our room was fantastic and we had the best time staying here. I would also like to say a huge thank you to Rajeesh at the poolside bar. We sat there both for lunch and early evening drinks and he was a complete delight, even offering to take photos of my husband and I! Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. We will be back! "
"Everything you would expect from a hotel of this standard and more.  Not one fault, service, food and drinks were all spot on.  The pool was very nice, and a good place to relax.  The food though excellent, and some of the best I have tried so far in india. "
"This grand hotel is my favourite hotel in the world. I stayed here in 2001 and wanted to share some photos I had of the trip. Pure luxury in the heart of Mumbai. The breakfast was delicious, and had many different cuisines from around the world."
"This was our third visit in ad many years - each time we had the most amazing time - they are so welcoming and the staff all lovely - we were upgraded to a club room on the sixth floor of the historic wing - the only place to stay in this hotel, it’s a hotel within a hotel with separate check in offering a more personal service than the main lobby. You get the use of a lounge for complimentary soft drinks all day with nibbles and delightful afternoon tea and pre dinner snacks. Breakfast is served in a beautiful restaurant, small buffet with now most breakfast dishes cooked to order, much more personal. The pool is a wonderful haven away from the bustling Mumbai, they made a table reservation prior to my trip at Trishna and they will organise an a/c taxi for your return to the"
I have wanted to visit this hotel for 30 years and finally got here for my 50th Birthday- what a joy this hotel is. The facilities and staff are amazing . I can not complement the staff enough I can not find the appropriate words to convey the high level of excellent service they provide each and every guest. Everyone should experience the Taj even if it’s only for 1 night - we had the pleasure of 5 nights in this wonderful hotel and amazing city.
A great place to stay.Faultless in every way.Adjacent to the Gateway to India.Several Restaurants to suit every tase.Very attentive staff who provide great service.To stay at the Taj is an experience to cherish.
Stayed at this iconic hotel for one night over the weekend. It is absolute royalty from the time you enter the hotel to the check in process to the rooms everything is perfect with absolutely nothing to complaint at all. Had dinner at Wasabi and this is one of the best Japanese food i have had in my life and is comparable to the food in japan. Will surely visit again very soon.
Beautiful hotel from glittering gallery to beautiful hotel rooms to amazing restaurants... if you have big pocket then this is the hotel to relax and rest after enjoying beautiful mumbai ... its near gateway of india which is the perfect place to take evening walks and enjoy sea breeze...must visit hotel
Fortunate to spend 3 nforgettable nights in The Mumbai Palace. Comfortable and spacious rooms. Staff who are so friendly and attentive. A setting which takes you back to another world. A most enjoyable and memorable stay. 
"I stayed in the Taj Palace in a sea view room with my 2 friends. The staff made this a truly memorable and delightful experience. From the time we checked in we were treated in a warm and friendly manner: nothing was too much bother and they went out of their way to make our stay special.  I want to single out a few very special staff: Kashmira in the Sea Lounge offered friendly service and advice on the food. We enjoyed her service very much. In reception/concierge, Pallak Sachdeva was exceptional and Tanmay from housekeeping who had rose petal foot baths and scrubs ready for us when we arrived back at our rooms after being out. We didn’t ask for any of this and it was such a delightful thing to share as three female friends traveling together.  This has to be one of the best"
"i stayed here last month, generally stay at the Trident but this one time i stayed here. the tariff is way higher than other 5 star hotels. the property as such is great especially the old wing - its amazing.   the rooms are quite small if compared to other hotels.   Food was nice."
"I have never wrote a review on here but after my experience at the hotel I felt the need to share. Having dined with my wife and two young children at the Taj for her birthday, the kids were unwinding in the lounge and were a little noisy for a couple of minutes. One of the staff members came up to me and advised me that guests were checking in and asked me to control my children. I was shocked. If this was for a long period of time I could understand but after a few minutes??? I questionned if this was a family friendly hotel and I was advised it was. I have been to several hotels worldwide and never faced such requests. I was shocked a I also considered myself a guest having dined there a few minutes earlier. Despite the lovely food and great service in the restaurant the"
"This beautiful hotel is situated opposite the Gateway to India and within easy distance of the sights of Mumbai. The staff are unfailingly delightful; nothing is too much trouble. Lovely pool and outdoor area, bars, lounges, superb breakfast buffet, stunning Diwali decorations."
"I've been meaning to write this review for a very long time. We spent 3 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in December last year. Our room was in the Palace wing, which I highly recommend to book. Every piece of art around the hotel tells its own tale of the old city. The staircase is absolutely stunning. Our room had a side view of the Gate of India. We also had access to the exquisitely decorated palace lounge, for tea/coffee and snacks at any time of the day/ night.  Breakfast at the sea lounge is a must. I would definitely recommend booking a table by the window, which overlooks the Gate of India. Having said that, any other tables in the sea lounge is just as good. It is to a large extent the decor, the ambience and the staffs' attention that conveys meaning to the"
"Best hotel customer service in the world... no exaggeration.  Every person in the hotel greets you with joy.  Everyone goes out of their way to help you.  They treat all the guests with respect and kindness.  Anything I needed at any time of day, they helped out.  But more than anything it was the positive attitude that won the day and makes this the best customer experience I’ve ever had."
"Though we stay in Mumbai , but we chose Taj Mahal Palace for our Anniversary celebration , got a room booked at palace  though not Sea facing but Pool facing , we have found it more beautiful as one can see the entire palace view from the balcony , the sea view one can enjoy while sitting at Sea Lounge. One can feel the rich heritage at Palace and we enjoyed every moment over there , be at lobby , at Sea lounge  at Palace lounge , at Pool .  I am not able to recall the names but the team made our room really special with flowers , balloon decoration , Cake and special chocolate for our daughter. Welcome drink at Palace lounge was awesome , then lunch at Sea lounge , an unforgettable experience. Dinner we had at Wasabi , most popular restaurant, we booked in morning itself. The"
Stayed here for 2 nights with my tour group. Absolutely stunning hotel. Rooms are fantastic. Staff are ridiculously helpful. Breakfast was excellent. Across the road from the Gateway of India. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.  
"As soon as you step into this hotel, you feel you are going back in time!  Beautifully furnished with beautiful artwork and furnishings!  We had afternoon tea on the first floor overlooking the Gateway of India.  The service was good, although we went after the early afternoon rush.  Plenty to eat and to choose which sandwiches suited your taste.  A must if you have half a day to take in this iconic hotel!"
"A stunningly beautiful hotel and outstanding at all levels. The service and welcome is world class.  Satish Gaikwadi, who leads the Concierge team always provides a first class &  personal service - he is simply a legend!  Sea Lounge staff are exceptional as is the food. The staff treat you super special and  make you feel comfortable and at home. As always, Chef Deepika and her team were incredibly attentive and went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. Many thanks to the entire team for making our stay so special,"
"I had planned to celebrate my 28th birthday in Taj Tower, Colaba and made a booking for the Superior Room City view from 15th to 17th October’19. I was super excited on check-in as I was upgraded to Taj Mahal Palace. Taj Palace Room – (2.5/5) Overall room experience was below average. I had high expectations from Taj Palace’s room. But, the room was not even at par with the Taj Tower rooms where I have stayed earlier. Some might say its “116 yrs old heritage”, etc. But surely not my cup of tea. Room highlights - Bed - A queen-sized bed which was comparatively harder than most of the 5-star hotel beds (which are super soft). Quality of the wall near windows was not good, it had small spots/blisters that occur after wall dampness. Bathroom – Although compact, looked gorgeous with"
"Great facilities, excellent service.  One of the best breakfast buffets I've had the privilege to enjoy.  Pricey but well worth the experience.  We also enjoyed the tour of the hotel with the hotel historian.  The tour is only open to guests of the hotel.  Sign up when you check-in."
"We can’t recommend this hotel highly enough. It was our fourth stay here and every time we have nothing but superlatives to describe the ambience, the quality of the rooms and the staff who really want to make each guest feel special.  Breakfast at the Sea Lounge had the best choice of food of anywhere we have stayed and if you want a special experience try the  High Tea. The front office staff and the Concierge are amazing."
This was a fantastic stay & at the Heritage old wing. Right from the Airport Reps & the travel desk Cars which bring you to the hotel the services were  just immaculate. Was a little disappointed with the turnout of the Old Wing entrance esp the security part & the pots around in that area. The Staff who came to escort to the room did not get back reg the clarity on the billing Instructions. The old formats of security corridor  cameras are quite obviuos . The Bell desk staff uniforms are a little incongruous unlike others. The smoke detectors is slightly disturbing if you sleeping on that side of the bed in the room.Its blinking.  The In room dining service is prompt & efficient. The bamboo plants could be looked into as one certainly did not have a branch/ shoot.  The
"Fantastic stay as usual  The best Hotel in Mumbai Sure  Service , room , Pool , SPA etc......  I will come back in 2020 for sure  Enjoy ur stay in Mumbai and this Hotel is very central jsut infront of Gate of India  "
"When you book a hotel at this level you expect to find an exceptional hotel with exceptional service, restaurants, installations, and the experience should be unforgettable. It was. Everyone and everything in the hotel was worth  it. Thank you! Our only regret was not having stayed longer."
"At least once in your life you must stay in the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai! I’ve been a guest here on numerous occasions I’ve the past 50 years, and enjoy the ambiance, Sea Loung, pool and veranda areas, and the Harbour Bar and restaurants!"
"This is just such a stunning hotel. The luxurious building is complemented by the excellent staff who will never stop making you feel special and relaxed. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Bathroom equipped with all you need, comfortable beds, plenty of storage, fridge, kettle, cafetière. I prefer the Palace side to the tower as the rooms are larger and nearer the pool, but the Tower is still lovely if you are on a tighter budget. Beautiful pool area, plenty of bars and restaurants, enjoy the hotel, you don’t have to leave!"
"It was my first stay at a Taj Hotel In New Delhi. It did not disappoint. Very luxurious, and every thought is gone into making the guests feel very special. The staff are all incredibly friendly and a lovely evening was had in the blue bar. The breakfasts are really good with great choices for all. Would def stay there again."
The hotel is beautiful.  It. It only smells like roses everywhere you go the staff are lovely and quietly attentive.

"Stayed at the Taj ( Palace Wing )at the end of our long India holiday. It was on our bucket list for a long time and finally we managed to do it. Truly lived up to all the hype, oozes character that no other hotel could provide. Wonderful staff, service is class act, the whole this is an experience that we will never forget. Cannot wait to stay at the Taj again."

"Just amazing!  The grandeur of the hotel took my breath away. First visit to Mumbai. Taj Palace hotel is a heritage hotel that gives specific character to Mumbai. Step inside the lobby of the hotel and you are transferred to another world, a world of class and old age heritage."
The Taj Mahal Palace- Souk restaurant. Food: Was ok. Think twice before ordering any Mutton dishes. Prawns Tasine and Dijaj Maqluba rice were awesome. Will rate 3/5 Mocktails: Nice. Will rate 4/5 Service: A bit slow. Will rate 3/5 Ambiance: Perfect evening. Will rate 5/5 Desserts: Mouth watering. Especially  Baklava and Bstilla Au Lait(a must try). Will rate 5/5. Overall an ok outing.
We stayed here for our wedding anniversary recently and I can honestly say it was the most beautiful hotel we’ve ever stayed in. The staff are happy and helpful and go out of their way to ensure you have the possible stay. Everything was effortless.  
"Remarkable building, excellent service and great location makes this to be voted as the best in India. The new tower added is modern architecture high rise building the old structure renovated after the rattack holds the charm. Every care has been taken to maintain the integrity and charm during renovation."
"So privileged to stay in this beautiful hotel in Mumbai, the equivalent of Peninsula in Hong Kong, Raffles in Singapore m, or Peace Hotel in Shanghai.  Iconic and luxurious. Rooms rebuilt and redone over the last 10 years. Private luxuriant gardens and pool area. Service second to none - I had a personal housekeeper, “Arjun”, who tidied up my room on a twice a day basis; each time leaving little personal touches, like flower petal designs on the marble floors, and at night a small gift with a local Indian touch eg relaxing aromatherapy oils, handmade lip balm, incense.  I was part of a Leadership Conference for my firm whose aim was to showcase India as a destination, and also our Indian colleague’s services. The Taj was a fitting introduction for all of those from around the"

The Taj Mahal was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor to house the remains of his wife. The architecture is considered the perfect example of Muslim art in India. The white marble shines in the daylight and seems to make the palace change color.
"I am originally from India, Kolkata. Now live in USA.   In my Travel to 65+ countries due to work,....I never came across such great Hospitality which I had during my recent staying at the Taj. Last 25+ Years, we live in USA/ Canada, stayed many Hotels...but Taj is superb, from the day of arrival at mid night till departure. In my 'Spanish Suit' everything was very perfect and confirms the staying more comfortable. Looking from the window.....total Arabian Sea and Ships are anchoring one after another. Lots of people were walking through the footpath to enjoy the air from the sea.  Upon return in US, I have explained my experience to many friends, colleagues. They are looking forward to be your guest.  One last thing made my stay at Taj more nostalgic, due to the fact that about"
"From the time we entered the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel near the Gateway of India, we were greeted with genuine smiles with great service. Jiyan from reception checked us in, took us through to the room and told us about every facility we were entitled to for our package. We were on the 4th Floor, we had Floor Butler service during the day - Narendra and Pranshu Gupta during the night. At Lunch at the Shamiana we had excellent service by Janice and her team. At Breakfast at the Shamiana we had Prashant/Jagjyot and their team  who served us very well. We had a special Latte by Rohidas who wrote Good Morning on the Latte which was so special. The Breakfast and Lunch Buffet spread  had variety and were excellent. Housekeeping service was extremely thoughtful and innovative in his"
Awesome stay at the hotel !! Staff was also good and helpful. Food was very yummy. Stayed for two days and really enjoyed my stay . I would also like to mention about the awesome breakfast spread. Thanks
"I returned to the Taj Palace this year and was delighted to discover I had been upgraded to a Club room in the Palace wing.  Last time my late husband and I had been allocated the corner room overlooking the Gateway to India so I had imagined this time would be disappointing.  However the room was beautiful, the bed divine and the service impeccable.  I also loved the ability to have a drink and nibbles in the Lounge Bar as I was travelling alone. I was not well at this time and the kind butler found the medication I needed and brought it to my room.  I spent the days by the pool, recovering from my cold.  Surely I couldn't have been in a more lovely location?"
"Had a memorable royal experience right from the check in to check out, you will treated as a royal guest. Once in a lifetime experience and need to experience it. Looking forward to come back again very soon."
Amazing building. We had a local guide who was very good and informative. The price to enter was worth it even if it was doubled. Ive seen it touched it and taken photos of it and yet it is still difficult for me to believe my own photographs because it is so perfect. It is an experience I would recommend.
We have stayed for a few days for business trip and have our son with us. The hotel is so impressive in its service. The building of course is lovely and beautifully furnished especially in the ground floor lounge and the hallways and rooms. The pool is lovely with a jungle  garden feel thanks to the trees. But hands down the service is the best thing about it. We travel at least monthly to hotels of comparable star rating and yet the service here has really taken us by surprise. The little thoughtful things the people serving our room leave that they notice we need to the lovely surprise chocolate gift that was left for our son. The service at all resturants and room service and the Concierge who was so helpful in finding us a great local experience. Food is really very good
"My second stay at The Taj and I look forward to many more. The service is of the highest standards, welcoming and warm, while the rooms are timeless.  Dining at both breakfast and lunch/dinner has never failed to please; Shamiana is perhaps wrongly overlooked as a superb destination to eat."
"I have been at the Taj Mahal in three different opportunities, each one has been unforgettable. It’s one of the most amazing places you can ever visit. Try to stay in town so you can enjoy the view at dawn and sunset."
The most beautiful hotel from the outside and exquisite inside. We were treated like VIPs from the minute we arrived until the minute we departed. The hotel staff are extremely welcoming and friendly but also very professional Our room was absolutely superb and had views overlooking the sea and the Gate to India The pool area and outside terrace is truly heavenly an  oasis in the middle of Mumbai  I can’t recommend this iconic hotel enough I just loved it.
"The location is like an hour away from the airport but the hotel is one of the best I have stayed in my travels around the world.  As a compliment to the chef, the Indian cuisine is definitely the best I have had at a hotel. "
We stayed a couple days. The location is good for visits.  The service is excellent. You are chauffeured from and to the airport. The suites are large. The Indian food one of the best. Stay in the old aisle. The new part is not so good
This was an amazing place. Its sheer size and grandeur are something hard for a photo to capture. Absolutely amazing workmanship. Best advise is to go very early in the morning just as soon as they open.
Taj hotel is very beautiful in this hotel every people served very delightly in this hotel  every food made from pure material service of this hotel very good forigner also loved to visit this hotel i will also enjoy there very much i will suggested every people to go there and enjoyed there 
"we with couple and friend enjoyed stay too much. it is life time memorable experience.at each step in the hotel there was someone to welcome and offer their services. stay,food quality, hospitality more than expectations."
Afternoon tea was an amazing experience in luxurious surroundings. With background piano music we were treated to a buffet that contained hot and cold savoury bite sized portions of both Indian and European cuisine. This was followed by sweet delights and warm homemade scones with jam and cream. Well with a visit. 
"It provides you an Imperial look . This hotel takes you at another level . The staff , ambiance and food was beyond expectations . Staff continued to ‘wow' throughout our stay  . A great place for family outing. Proud of taj."
"Went for dinner last night and was greeted with their new security policy of not allowing cabs with non resident guests onto the porch. The so called ""security reasons"" apparently don't apply when guests are checking in or when it rains :).  I chose to pursue this further and the duty manager lady flat out lied that this has always been their policy when i myself have been there multiple times happily in various cabs.  Then she directed me to the accommodation in charge who then went with the excuse of ""limited space"" in the valet area! When i insisted to speak to the GM, was curtly told he won't be available :). Overall it felt like a very calculated insult to me on the lines of "" We won't say we don't value your patronage but you better take the hint""  Bottom line is if you"
A very impressive hotel. Extreme luxury and amazing service. Includes very good restaurants and comfortable rooms. A Highly recommended hotel. It is one of the best hotels in all of India. Great stay.
"Excellent experience, a must for every one, the staff over here is excellent and makes you feel really at home. They also surprise us with many wow moments and make the stay a memorable one. I celebrated my daughters birthday and that was a wonderful moment. My mother visited a 5 star (first time ) and I am glad that it was Taj she had tears in her eyes "
The venue is of course majestic. Very well maintained in full glory it allows the visitor to travel back in time ... Definitely worth a visit.  The staff is very attentive and courteous.  The only question would be in terms of value for money between the Tower and the Palace wing...
"Opulent but charming, service impeccable. We all hated to leave and agreed we would go back to India just to stay at the Taj Palace. Restaurants and shops to suit everyone’s taste and wallet. It is worth every rupee. "
I cannot recommend Taj Palace enough. Their level of service sets a new standard. Spend the extra money and stay on the Palace side. Worth it especially for the access to the private lounge. I absolutely recommend and would stay no where else in Mumbai.
"One of the original hotels from the colonial times. Magnificent architecture and decor. Great pools and gym lots of food choices. Held an important business meeting here 60+ guests and hotel was very good to work with, no hassles to and request we made. It is on the pricey side but cheaper if you stay in the tower section rather than the original palace. Also lots of interesting shops in the immediate vicinity "
"Stayed there for a couple of nights for a business visit Offers amazing view of Arabian Sea and gateway of India is 20 meters away  The hotel offers amazing hospitality, great food and superior services. If you are planning stay in Mumbai , plan at least one night here to see the magic this hotel offers and you won’t regret"
"          The stay at The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai was long-time ambition and it fulfilled  during our 32nd anniversary celebrations. We have booked a club room (sea view)and the same was upgraded to an EXECUTIVE SUITE with spacious living/dining area, bedroom and an ultimate bathroom/tub. Thanks for the complimentary upgrade.            The suite was decorated with fresh flowers,balloons and also they kept a delicious cake for the anniversary. We were truly thankful to the entire team Taj,for making our anniversary celebrations memorable for ever.            We have no words to explain the unlimited luxury and the outstanding hospitality that we experienced throughout our stay. Very cordial staff, high standard of cleanliness in each every corner and good value for money.       "
Wow. What an hotel.   It is expensive but worth any dollar.  Such a beautiful and charming hotel.  Such a magnificent building.  Such a super service.  We took a  taj club room.  You pay $70 more than grande palace room and you get wonderful room in the 5th floor and free transportation to the hotel and breakfast in the beautiful “sea lounge” and  free afternoon Hi-Tea in the “Palace lounge” and around the clock tea and coffee in the Palace lounge and early check in and late checkout. It is really worth it. We felt like the royal family.  Do not miss the historical guide tour of the palace in the afternoon.  Do not miss the “Mumbai  at dawn” tour.  
"Hi I have been to your coffee shop at around 02:30 am on 19th September for mid night dinner over there first of all your staff member not attentive and using their phone . Called one of your service staff Mrityunjay called him few times but he ignored , I went to him to know why  it is taking so so long for our order please check . Afterwards he didn’t even come back to update about our order .Food was also okay nor anybody came to know our feedback.We pay price  for the experience not because you can show your attitude to your guest . Is there any service quality difference between morning and night shift staff. I ordered veg pulao, Aloo prantha ,Dal fry,veg thali totally awful experience   Regards Satyam Datta 8950588949"
We stayed at the Oberoi.  Our very favorite hotel chain ever. Went for lunch. Not impressed. At the time there was a group of travel agents making noise and being impressed by the staff.  Left us feeling ignored. Would never return 
"A lot of security guards. Good but not often comfortable. Too much time taken for valet service. One late evening duty manager named Rahul was not at all well behaved and rather impatient and indecent. I feel these people are more caring about your foreign tourists than we Indians. Too much of rules and policies. No outside food is allowed even if it is from my home. However, the pool side staff was good and even I should appreciate the little flower decor on the floor of my room. The greeting during checkin was also very average. I spent my birthday in the hotel but no one seems to know or give a wish. This is very unlike the Oberoi where I felt really special on my birthday last year.  "
I have stayed here before and gave it 5 starts . I booked thur Expedia and got room upgraded amazing surprises  in my room . Not this time booking Thur taj web site . Maybe go with Expedia. The staff at the restaurant for breakfast are very good 
"The property doesn’t need any review or feedback, the name is enough. Booked our stay to celebrate our spcl day. We were lucky to be upgraded to Taj Mahal palace and experienced the Royal Tajness experience.  Rooms were very luxurious and equipped with all modern amenities. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Though this was not our first stay but I’m sure we will be returning here for more. "
Absolutely fantastic service . The staff were amazing and went beyond their normal 5* service by making my wife’s Birthday very special ...... thank you folded_hands_medium_skin_tonered_heartfolded_hands_medium_skin_tone We will definitely be returning soon 
superb experice with tajawesome food and value for money amazing location food at masalacraft and breakfast at shamiana...superb buttler service and our advisor mr.gaurav &parmarji thank u taj give facillites and happiness
"Special place, very beautiful, an oasis in the middle of Mumbai. Make sure however that you ask for a quiet room and one that has not been recently repainted - they don't seem to use non toxic paint and the lingering smells of paint and finishes can make you sick - you can ask for an air purifyer, which they kindly provided. Some of the rooms overlooking streets can be more noisy."
"One that justifies the name of luxury hotels in India, Taj hospitality has been one of my favorites. The views from this place ,to the impeccable room decor , comfort and the service ofcourse everything was so smooth and amazing. A special stay at Taj on my birthday, they ensured to make it special with balloons and cakes.  A completely recommended place for a leisurely stay to enjoy the best of Mumbai - Gateway of India views . "
"Chambers at Taj has always been exclusive. But over the years it had become a bit jaded but in recent past it has livened up in all senses. There is renewed energy in its looks, positioning, offers, events etc. Last week saw Nigella Lawson cook there exclusively for a select few. Looking forward to more at Chambers. "
"We stayed here on my wife’s Birthday and would like to say it is one of the best hotels we have stayed in ...... this is due to certain people who made our stay extra special ...... Satish - Master Concierge, Sumit Deol the dining manager , Wasim Shaikh - he checked us in , Mahtaab the operations manager , Anshula manager of palace lounge and Namrata in the palace lounge and Saqandhar who cleans our room ..... not forgetting Mala , Ansalem and the asst manager in breakfast room ........ there are many more but these guys stood out and went out of their way to make her Birthday very special ...... Thank you and we will definitely see you again ....red_heartred_heartred_heart"
"Stayed a week ago for a night to pamper myself. It's not the room rate, I'm totally dissapointed with my visit.   Firstly, too many staff and they are everywhere and kerp saying Good Afternoon. In one case, the same guy repeated this few minutes later, maybe he not know who he wishes.  Secondly, breakfast is bad. I ask thosai. Cooked by non South Indian and it's tasteless. At price we pay, Taj could easily employ a good chef from Chennai.   Booked directly via hotel n they gave Rs 3500 credit for food. But, not reflected in final bill. We all know tricks hotel pay as we forget or in rush and just pay.   Next day stayed at Marine Plaza Hotel. Less than half price, we get Executive Suite.   This my last stay at any Taj. It's just branding.   "
"So, my second month in Mumbai and my apartment is still not comfortable...The treat seemed a bit expensive and I reckoned that the book store would be worth it.  I was right, I found two cookery books.  Apart from such minor details, I enjoyed the spa and explore the art galleries."
"This is our 3rd stay in about 2 years. We always stay at least 5 days to allo0w ourselves to be totally pampered with the sheer indulgence of this magnificent Hotel, this magnificent Palace!! Everything is just superb - we cant fault the experience we had, we just want to come back again and again. It is truly a magic place. We stayed in a Taj Club Suite in the Palace wing - we were made to feel like VIPs. We were greeted by Cyberica Fernandes who dealt with all the check in formalities and escorted us to our room, she was wonderful, engaging and genuine. Nothing was too hard for her to keep us happy. Our experience in the Palace Lounge for high tea and cocktails was marvellous, made truly memorable by Kevin Podder and his wealth of information about the Taj Palace Hotel and"
True royalty all the way from the airport pick up to check in. Butler service was a plus. Luxurious rooms with nice views. Room service was always prompt and precise.Extremely helpful concierge. Will definitely come back.
Seeing the Taj Mahal up close is unforgettable! The architecture is majestic and incomparable. The while train ride from Delhi to Agra is absolutely worth it! This is a must-see when you visit India..
" I had a wonderful stay. The service was exceptional and the staff most kind, helpful and attentive. I loved our room which they so kindly upgraded on their own. The Taj Mahal hotel Mumbai will always have a special place in my heart and I can’t wait to come back!"
We enjoyed our stay at this luxury hotel and had a club room/Suite which was very luxurious beautiful bathroom a sitting room. Meals were taken in the Chinese and Indian restaurants and our last night was in the souk a Lebanese cuisine at the top of the taj tower.Food was excellent. Staff were very friendly and helpful. the hotel has many shops and nearby the gateway to India is a large monument well worth walking too as was the promenade a very busy area during the day and at night to watch the sunset.
"Room service is very poor, in this case it’s BUTLER service. All the time confusion, there is no proper co-ordination. Sea Lounge, Apollo Bar services was very good. At the same time at Masala Craft service was ok. Heritage tour was very good."
"every thing is perfect clean rooms, excellent service ,testy food , tight security and historic tour in the hotel at 3.30 PM is very good. we knows about 1st bar license from government of independent india issue to this hotel. In total royal stay in this hotel.  "
"When it comes to luxury hotels, it can be hard to perceive the perfect fit. I'm always on the lookout for stay-cations where privacy, discretion and hospitality is paramount, so when I was invited to Lakme Fashion Week- Mumbai, the first hotel that came to mind was Taj Mahal Palace And Tower. Sprawled over 2.6 acres, it has two buildings: Palace and Tower, historically and architecturally different from each other. Cosseting guests in timeless grandeur, generations have celebrated milestones in the palace wing, including a roster of presidents, royalty and luminaries King George V, Queen Mary, Lord Mountbatten, Bill Clinton, Albert Einstein, Neil Armstrong, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, Roger Moore, Joan Collins, Mick Jagger, Oprah Winfrey,"
It was the best experience of staying in a hotel. The property is beatiful and the staff is very courteous and helpful. The food is also very good.  Don't miss the view from Souk. Will definitely visit again.
"Location is good, very close to the airport.. Easily commute is available and service is great, staff is very generous and kind as well as helpful. Being in hospitality industry, really felt like a valued guest."
"From the moment we entered the property your team did everything they could have to make us feel our day was as special to you as it was to us. Any hotel can be big and beautiful but truely your team adds soul to your building, and a beautiful one.  From the traditional welcome at the gate, to one step forward assistance at the reception by S***ashish(forgot the name). Thanks to him for helping us plan our day, and arranging all the surprises. Thank you Mr. Husain Mohammad, Mr. Pritesh Hindalekar, Mr. Nitin and his team for the beautiful flowers and decorations. Thank you for going over the top to make sure that we had the most memorable experience. Thanks to Ms. Devia for the wonderful tour. Your love and association with the hotel reflects in your eyes. The hotel was beautiful"
Another outstanding stay at this gorgeous property. We stay here every year and we are always impressed by the property and level of service offered. We stayed in a luxury suite (Aquarius suite) which was very spacious and was decorated tastefully. The palace butler service was fantastic and they tended to our every need. Breakfast at the sea lounge was fantastic with great views of the gateway of India. Also had access to the palace lounge which is a great amenity they offer. Stopped there for afternoon tea everyday. What makes the stay at the property all the more special is the service. Staff go over and above to tend to your every need and always do it with a beaming smile of their face. Cannot wait to go back next year. 
Stayed for 4 night with my family and we were completely in heaven. The building itself is fabulous! You cannot have a better setting. Now for the staff... AMAZING! They will literally help you with anything you need and you really do feel special. The breakfast in the sea lounge ( I think that’s what it was called) was delicious. Ate so much food every morning and I think the best service in the world works at the breakfast lounge. Will definitely stay again! Oh and the pool is Super deep! Added bonus !
I was showing Gateway of India to my friends from overseas and went over to the Taj for a quick bite at Shamiana. Good ambiance. We ordered Veg. Pizza and Konkan Prawns. Both were excellent. Good presentation. Prompt attentive service. Taj never dissapoints. Will certainly visit again.
"Went to visit friends staying there, they were very happy with the services, the public areas are beautiful, once you get past security, you enter a world of old world luxury, the building adjacent the the new part of the hotel."
"Immaculate! It has been more than two years since my last stay at the Grande Dame given that I’ve been staying at the Taj Santa Cruz for convenience due to commitments in the Suburbs. Whilst I have come to love the Taj Santa Cruz (large, modern rooms, some familiar faces ex Taj, and of course, Tajness), as soon as I entered my room in the Heritage wing I knew I was HOME! The Taj Palace is indeed unique - at 116 years young! What sets it in a league of its own is the staff - the true life blood of the Grande Dame! From the Sardarji’s at the entrance both old (Kewal Singh) and the new, to the porters (too many to name but Kailash, Vijay, etc etc etc), front desk (CONGRATULATIONS to Arzaan, (home grown from front desk to Director of Rooms via the Taj Santa Cruz) and the great"
"Great location with views of the ocean and well laid out gardens  Excellent ambiance, food and service -  Rana, Nuwan, Amila and Manujeewa attended to our every need and made the occasion a memorable one.  Highly recommend!!"
"The Taj Palace hotel by India Gate is iconic and I must recommend using the toll road and bridge from the airport. The last time I came to Mumbai the airport was a small concrete box with slums outside but how things have changed and developed. The lobby at the Taj and the security has certainly been increased since my last visit and updated but the rest of the hotel has a great charm and I am amazed how quickly the refurbishment works took place. The restaurants are truly amazing and you cannot fault the service.   Upgrading to the suite was worth the money as you get your own butler service with a room with a separate living room (separated by a wall and door) and two separate bathrooms, so you can request a second bed but a level of service second to none.   Taj really knows"
"Very nice place to go with fabulous views of the Gateway to India  Feels very special. Served by several waiters in a beautifully decorated room with views of the bay  Afternoon tea was approx £26 /27 I think if memory serves which wasn’t too bad at all but it felt very luxurious and special  You can opt to do the afternoon tea in the form of a buffet which if you’re hungry is probably better and you can chose your own it’s just not as pretty to look at on your table   They also had a full menu of lunch , snacks , great wine selection etc  Worth a visit to treat yourself and the hotel is Stunning and full of great old pictures of its famous visitors "
"When one books a Taj property, and that too the best of the city, a club room with benefits galore, the expectations are nothing less than that of a heavenly stay. We were greeted very warmly and my daughter was showered with gifts since it was her birthday.The room was decorated with balloons and floral rangoli.All was going very well until we decided to have beverages at the palace lounge.The service was very slow.This continued throughout the stay.Even at breakfast, our beverages would easily take 20- 35 minutes. We were told the hotel is very busy.On one occasion I was told the person waiting on my table forgot to order my coffee.I observed that the F&B's older generation staff was much swifter and efficient than the younger lot.Our concern was immediately taken care of but"
We enjoyed the luxury and service of this famous hotel and felt completely safe with the additional security measures taken. The location is excellent and the choice of restaurants impressive. It was the ultimate treat for the family! 
Our family had a nice time at this historical place and hotel. A good location can go for a quick early morning run alone marine drive. Food in sea lounge is very good. Staff is very courteous and well behaved.
"Right from the time of planning our reservation till our final checkout,our experience with Taj has been of world class hospitality. Housekeeping has been very prompt and provided excellent level of services. One place that stood out by the sheer courteousness,hospitality,attention to the minutest details is Sea Lounge. We had numerous evenings and late nights at Palace Lounge which again turned out to be a cozy,chilling place. La Patisserie is another place worth visiting. We did visit Golden Dragon,Souk and were satisfied with the cuisine there. I wish all the very best to the entire team of Taj Mahal Palace hotel in their continuous efforts of serving their guests to an exemplary standards. Looking forward to our next memorable stay here. Capt.Harbinder Singh Kapany"
"Well behaved staff, enjoyed the food with full of comfort and enjoyment. Rooms were clean well decorated, service was excellent. Indor games options are available. SPA is also available at a reasonable price."
"A palace!!! That’s it.   The hotel is just amazingly standing up next to the sea, especially the architecture design and view just stunning and give a wow when u look at it. You can’t miss this place when u r visiting Mumbai... next to it is the Gateway of India!   The hotel - super class and it is like living in the palace... the ancient way! Every corner, every elements is a collection item, an art, and a precious art piece. You can browse for around for hours along the corridor and diff level just to appreciate a art gallery...   "
"A very grand place, we missed the private tour as we checked in late and had to leave early. But the inside is as grand and luxurious as the outside! Its well maintained and truly gives you a look into the heritage. The best was the view from the window....Gateway of India. I Would recommend rooms on the top floor. We recieved a great welcome with tulsi beads necklaces.  Looked cute. Good service and very polite staff"
I along with my wife checked into the hotel on 15/08/19 room no 1902 for my birthday which was on the 16th.I expected the Taj luxury and pampering for us and it was as expected.What I  soured our experience was at the time of check in they had taken my credit card no for some security reasons.I usually don't give it but considering the Taj trustworthiness since I was a Taj inner circle member once I provided the same.They charged 5000 to my card instantly which they said was as security which was alright but I was shocked when later I got a message they had deducted my room rent charge as well which was fully paid for and was acknowledged by them at the front desk.When I complained at the reception via phone from my room the person first refused to accept my room was paid for
"As one of the greatest hotel of indea this hotel is amazing, the food was amazing and of course delicious, when it comes to price of rent then its average, rooms are so comfortable and gives very good experience."
"We spent 4 days at the hotel ( two rooms, a family of 4), we enjoyed every moment. The restaurants at the hotel are expensive but the food is good. The location is great and the entire experience worth the money. We recommended it with all our hart."
"The stay at Taj Mahal Palace was a long-time dream and fulfilled the wishes for daughter""s 25 th Birthday celebrations. No words to explain the Grandeur and Luxury we experienced there. It should be only personally witnessing and feel it. Right from Check in to Check out, we felt the royal treatment given. Our room was located in the Heritage corner and walking through the grand steps, fully carpeted with bright red colour and the tapestries were brilliant. Rooms were spacious and the bathroom was the ultimate. The luxury has spread its wings in every corner of the room and we just cherished every moment of it. The sea view from the restaurant, poolside coffee shop, the shopping arcade inside the hotel and the amenities are endless. Overall a great experience."
"Entry and all other decorative details of Taj are ridiculously gorgeous. Very glad it stands up and continues as it does. However, some minor issues with the Chinese we ate, July 2019.  It was pouring down bucket and I wanted to show my son (very UK) Gateway and Taj. Went for Chinese. It was 2 pm. We did get service however, I thought there was too much soya sauce-colour of all dishes was colour of soya. Maybe we just chose those dishes but I have had hot and sour soup in an authentic Chinese place and doesn't have to be quite so hot ! Even though there are as many waiters as customers (as in most 5 star Indian hotels) service is iffy. Older gentleman (Sikh/Punjabi) who served us was suitably snobbish (I like it) and knew what he was doing. The rest decided to chat whilst we ate"
"Located next to Gateway of India,  Taj Mahal Palace is a landmark in itself. And the hospitality is legendary.....   Right from the moment we entered, the staff went out of their way to make us comfortable. We were upgraded to Taj club room with a view of the Gateway of India.  The rooms are delightful with each object thoughtfully selected and placed to ensure one's comfort.   The fitness center is well equipped with trainers to guide in using the equipment. The spa has a wide variety of treatments.   The Palace lounge has a delicious buffet laid out every evening for tea. One can enjoy their cuppa while admiring the two works of art that adorn its walls. For the art Afficando,  there is an amazing M F Hussain piece adorning the lobby.   As for the food, Taj spoils one for"
One of the best hotels in the world for a reason. There is nowhere we would rather stay in Mumbai. The service is impeccable. The view from my room showed up gorgeous Gateway to India. Can’t wait to go back.
I visited this place to my recent trip to mumbai.its a beautiful place and luxurious one .the food was good andthe prices were okay.the team management is good overall a nice place to stay and the view was mesmerising 
"After spending our holiday in Goa we decided to fly to Mumbai on our way home.  We looked at a few Hotels and different prices.  This Hotel was considerably more, than most of the accommodation in the area. We booked the Tower as a compromise.  We arrived at the hotel to find we had been upgraded to the Palace.  This place is marvellous whatever you ask for you get.  Do not be afraid to ask.  If we had paid the palace price it still would have been worth it.  The palace lounge was especially good.  The view over the gate of India and the bay at breakfast was amazing. Used the pool and Gym and found it difficult to leave the hotel to see the sites of Mumbai.  Best Hotel we have stayed in. Got an Uber from the hotel and payed cash an absolute delight. "
"Had a wonderful time at this historical hotel. The swimming pool was not operational during our stay which was a shame (and they had not mentioned it on their website while booking). However, they did upgrade us to club access which was a satisfactory resolution.  The club lounge with its rich interiors and that smoky fragrance was my favourite part of the hotel. Do not miss it. Sit by the large windows and watch the world pass by as you enjoy your coffee. They had a single malt/wine experience but I felt the selection of malts was somewhat limited.   Tip: Stay in the palace wing. The difference is huge.  Also, do opt for the complimentary Taj tour - it is worth the time to learn some truly fascinating things about this great hotel. Food was excellent throughout. A small"
It was superbbb .specially Service and property .awesome location .Food and ambience is great .I feel proud in staying in Taj mahal Palace executive suite.I cant forget the breakfast in souq restuarent in rooftop 
"Hello Yohan Billimoria/Duty Manager,  I want to thank you. It’s a pleasure visiting the Taj again for our Anniversary. You know how to make a friendly and inspiring environment.  No one else can match your performance.   Thank you for your hard work. Dr. JP "

"The Taj Mahal Palace is a wonderful hotel  . We had nice and calm stay at this hotel . Nice welcoming and friendly staff from the first step to the hotel. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable  The hotel located near to Gate of Mumbai India . The room is specious and clean . The breakfast is good in large space with great welcome all the time by the staff. 5 minutes walk to the market area , fast food  and restaurants . We had a very pleasant stay , good experience  and  a great time in this hotel . The only things we did not like it is some staff habit of running to you for tips . The hotel is much recommended to stay on it and defiantly we will visit it again."
went back to this hotel after 14 years and i must say that the renovated rooms and restaurants were well made. the staff held the same level of service of going above and beyond. kudos to the team!!!!
Fantastic hotel and we had a great time and i would stay there when ever possible  The staff and the food and the welcome were all better then i was wxpecting  Of course everything is a little on the higher side including the price 
"Taj mahal nice place and near from souq  The hotel staff were friendly, especially the room service. When we encountered rooms with a foul smell they changed the rooms to us, provided all the supplies we needed but you should reserve when leaving the hotel from the bill they charged me for internet though am sure I didn’t use the premium.they deal with us in a bad way to pay for aome thing really I didn’t use it. I will never go back to live there again, even though it is my second stay and the same time happened i leave the hotel and am full upset .  One negative behavior eliminates all the answers"
"Our desire to spend a week in this hotel was our prime motivation for a trip to Mumbai.  We were not disappointed on any front.   From check-in onwards Mahtaab & her team were exemplary in servicing our every need during our weeks stay. The views onto the Gateway of India, & its surrounding bustle of visitors, contrasting with the peaceful idyll within the hotel & pool, make this a beautiful sanctuary in Mumbai. Every member of staff we encountered went out of their way to make our stay something to treasure & we will most certainly return in the future."
"We had a one night ‘staycation’ during our India vacation here and what an exceptional experience this was !   We stayed in Taj Club room in the palace wing and had a room on the 5th floor with a Gateway of India / sea view. It felt like ‘home’ from the moment we stepped in - very comfortable check in and then swiftly shown the room by our butler Adrian.  This hotel has incredible history and the elegant corridors are full of artifacts and paintings. There is no real way or words to describe this further without being present there in person - it is an experience in itself.   The club rooms offered us many complimentary perks - afternoon tea, cocktail hour and post dinner Cognac and chocolate. Both the Palace Lounge & Sea Lounge are exceptional to say the least. The staff here"
You have to go there if you want to Test the great Luxury.the amazing palace is so big so many rooms and very services.Here you will get A real luxurious Experience.wich can't you describe in the words.
"Where do you even begin when it comes to the fantastic service provided by this truly quintessential establishment. From start to finish, the service matches the decor and ambience- simply first class. You can’t fault a single thing. From the fantastic service at breakfast to the amazing room service and treatment received in every single square inch of this beautiful building, you will truly feel like royalty. Fitting name providing an equally fitting service. Bravo to the Taj- let the others follow suit. clapping_hands_medium_skin_tone"
"Like every other excellent reviews you have read, I don’t know if I can add anything new. it’s a grand old place with a lot of old world charm, historical significance and the best hotel in India if not the world.  However a special mention to the tirelessly working staff. They give caring a whole new meaning and the Taj is Taj due to this amazing set of men and women.  They are dedicated, kind humble and have a genuine interest to make your stay comfortable.  I am going to mention a few people who made our stay a memorable event - Adrian Pritesh Ganesh Anshula Shubham the team at Masala Kraft the team in Sea lounge breakfast - Kiran, Kiran (there were 2 of them) Gaurav. Hope I got them all.  One of the staff members also mentioned that it was an honour to work there as was"
"Beautifuly decorated , sharp interior design which takes you back to the time of Maharaja.On each floor you can admire selective art objects perfectly choosen .  I liked a lot my room and special floral arrangment the staff provided every day. I enjoyed breakfast at Sea Lounge , lovely staff and great view of India Gate and Arabian Sea.I appreciated different boutiques proposing large choice of jewellery , clothes and accesories. It's very important to me the lovely staff providing kind and outstanding service."
I have been travelling the world from last 15 years but never seen such a wonderful service. First time i realised the its the service that makes the hotel wonderful not just walls and rooms. Cheers to their staff. Hotel is wonderful no doubt but staff is fantastic. Always smiling and never say no to anything. We have asked for nice breakfast and Staff asked what do you want sir? I asked for menu and he said dont worry sir just tell me what you want to eat. It was like fairy asking for my wish to fulfill and there are so many instances like this.  I have never given any feedback online for any hotel but this hotel services compelled me to write their feedback. Always going to stay in this hotel in Mumbai.. no other hotel. Great job Taj. Thanks for making our stay great and our
"We had met a friend of ours who lives in Mumbai there. It appeared very sophisticated from the outside. Unfortunately it was under repair so the doorman made us walk the whole length of the street, in that heat to get in. My husband was not a happy bunny as he was in crutches. No comparison whatsoever! We went sent to 3 different places to have breakfast and refused entry to each restaurant until I finally asked why and insisted that we sat down, inside. Once inside the restaurant everything was perfect. You can change money in the foyer, but they refused to give me a receipt! We are due back in Mumbai in 2020. Where would you suggest we have breakfast? Can we book we you?"
"I have been staying in Taj Hotels several times a week for the last two months. The service in this hotel is simply above the rest in terms of quality.   A perfect example:  Due to the extreme rains of the past few days, my room was smelling a bit damp. I mentioned this and just asked if someone could stop by to have a look. When I returned, there was a dehumidifier, a ritual footbath in a copper bowl, a face scrub, and some small items of jewellery. I expected someone to just come and do a bit of spraying of air freshener, but in true Taj hospitality, they took it to the next level and beyond. They don't call it the ""Palace"" for nothing.   I also highly recommend the free heritage tour which is offered daily in the lobby. The building itself is incredibly interesting and I"
"We celebrated our 1st anniversary at Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai. The staycation was above fantastic. As soon as we checked in we had a complimentary high tea at the Palace Lounge followed by a beautiful Anniversary special decor , cake , flowers. I must say the team is the best in the world - every staff was so polite , friendly and tried to add more value to the experience by coming and talking - giving more information, suggestions etc Best French toast at the Sea Lounge. Have to mention ANSELM at the Sea Lounge - mastt bandaa (very friendly and nice guy) Dil khush kardia - had the best breakfast experience . Golden Dragon serves the best Chinese in town - Cheung feun smiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyes"
"It was an amazing trip with my family, food was very delicious, varaties of food at buffet restaurant, helpful staff, I enjoyed lot, we specially thanks to all staff who was taking care of us, I will back on next visit Thank you"
"Special hotel with professional staff who know how to treat the guests. Room was very comfortable overlooking the sea, beautiful.  When I arrived to the hotel from my long train journey from Jaipur , my blood pressure flies high and i fainted.  The hotel staff been brilliant with care and straight away doctor been cold to my room to check and make sure all good. Even after few days when I left Taj and was heading to Goa there make sure I arrived to my next destination safe, I had a call... Not many hotel will do I am sure......"
"Mumbai Is the dream come true for many people. It's a city of dreams. And, in this city of dreams, is this all the more dreamier place called 'The Taj Mahal Palace'. Yes, the name rings a bell. It's the same place that got bombed by the terrorists on 26/11.   The beauty of this place is incomparable. There are high end shops here like Dior, Louis Vuitton etc.to name a few. Amidst these shops is a restaurant called Wasabi. Wasabi, as the name suggests, is a Japanese restaurant. I was ready for my order, in my head. The order details are:-  Vodka large with Red bull. Mushroom cheese pizza. Spicy Prawn tempura sushi.  To be honest, not much of a lover of the Mushroom Cheese pizza. The portion, as you can see in the picture, is too small to be filling my belly. The taste was okay"
"Nothing can beat Taj at making the guests feel home. From taking the charge of ur luggage after arriving to putting the luggage back  for your journey back they take care of you as their own. It is truly Indian way of treating the guests. There are small things that they do for you that add to the charm of this place. Special mention to the house keeping guys who surprised us with small little things  as an aroma oil at the bedside table for good sleep, a flower decoration , a beautiful coin box. Breakfast is awesome!! This is place that exceeds your expectations. "
"Everything from reservations, pre-arrival confirmation, arrival, dining experience and check-out were handled with superlative professionalism and warmth. My family accompanied me on this trip and they were delighted with the experience. Breakfast at Sea Lounge, dinner at Souk and lunch at Masal Kraft were outstanding - part due to great food and a large part due to superb service. What particularly came in handy for me was ready availability of umbrellas with the bell desk, I found them quite handy when we went visiting town during pouring rain."
"Your system is not cooperative for customer including staff.Only speak English and response zero. So, please check  system and staff  for comfortable stay .No any staff is co-prate the customer . We are unsatisfied the stay."
"The royal treatment we received during our stay was over the top. Each person, each day, at every point of contact ensured out needs were met, everything was to our satisfaction, and out stay was more than we expected.   Having a room with a sea view and a view of the Gateway to India added to the experience."
"This is an iconic Hotel that should be about luxury and history, it does not let you down. Best tip, we booked a suite room as you then get the Palace Lounge free, if you plan to spend time within the hotel this can save you a lot of money.Included with the suite is free tea, coffee and evening drinks from the lounge also afternoon tea which is wonderful and evening drinks (between 6pm -7.30pm) Coffee or tea is around £5 so getting this free all day long can make the room price so much better value. You also get a pick up or drop of from the airport included, which is great in its own, with great staff and service to meet you.  The staff are wonderful with this hotel but I must say Anshula Madok was outstanding in the palace lounge If you are in Mumbai you really have to have a"
The place cant be expressed by mere words..    ...   .the food the allout apperance still be great infront of all luxurious hotels in world. Too  expensive but yet worthfull.a palce to chill in mumbai.good for family and other typologies.  . 
"We booked a stay at the ""Best Hotel"" hotel In Mumbai India... the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. In April 2019, our stay at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai was VERY DISAPPOINTING. We arrived Mumbai at 5am and went directly to the Taj Hotel.  We checked-in early and charged 50% of the room rate for 5-6 hours.  Pricey, but seemed to be the only way to recover from our 24-hr airline travel.  For our early check-in we were provided upgraded accommodations.  Very nice, or so I thought.  When we entered the room the temperature was about 60F.  Little did I know that the temperature was a cover-up of thing to come.  After we unpacked and had breakfast, we went on a highlights tour of Mumbai.  Returning to the Taj, we had dinner and went to our room and went to bed.  We awoke in the early"
"Taj At Colaba is one of the best location hotels In Mumbai , hotel is neat and clean.The view is amazing ,preferably the sea view facing the Arabian Sea at the gateway of India, highly recommended to people visiting Mumbai and wants to stay at one of the best hotels in Mumbai."
"It is a lot of walking, wear comfortable shoes and carry a bottle of water. Crows of people from around the World. Take many photos of you and family at a World Wonder.  You read about The Taj Mahal Place in books now you can put your hands on it and stand on its grounds. "
I switched from Oberoi to Taj Mahal Palace four years back and till date I haven't regretted the switch. The difference that I see is the personal touches added right from the captain of the ship Mr. Taljinder SIngh to almost everyone whom I interacted with. A special thanks to him for a personalized hand written note welcoming back to the Palace.   I reached before the check in time but the check in was a breeze directly into the upgraded suite. What prompted me to write the review this time is the extra care that was taken throughout my stay. All in all absolutely top class and hope to see you in a few weeks time.
"An annual December visit to the Taj is something I look forward to all year.  Stay on the 6th floor overlooking the water.  So much to see as you gaze out at the busy waterway. The rooms on this floor are just beautiful and are a joy to wake up in.  This floor gives access to the executive lounge which is a fantastic element to the stay.  Cocktails, snacks on hand through the day.  The pool area is beautiful and tranquil with the hustle and bustle of India just over the wall.  Do a tour of the Taj (daily event) and learn the history behind it.  Cannot wait until December when I shall be back."
"Wow.....  I was at the Taj Mahal Palace. I had a business meeting planned at Taj Mahal Palace and was looking forward to be at the property....... No, by calling it a property, I would be undermining this Iconic creation by Mr. Jamshedji Tata. I have been around this Icon many a times but today was the first time that I have stepped into the Taj Mahal Palace.  The porch is beautiful with a waterfall at the entrance. As you enter the hotel, you are welcomed by beautifully fragrance and well lit lobby. Right in the centre of the lobby is a round table which has a beautiful table chandelier which is lit with candles. I wish they had the traditional Parsi cork float wick based Diva(s) (diyas) which are lit with the oil floating on water.  I was pretty much awed by the grandeur of"
not in the season but the hotel looks clean and spacious every member of the staff were eager to help everywhere and every moment upgraded when it was possible. and got an explanation to each of my questions
"The real beauty of taj mahal palace comes in night time with beautiful view of colourful light alongside the river.Generally  the are lot of people hanging there in evenings,so it looks like sort of festival in the evenings."
"We returned to the Taj after going 4 years ago and it did not disappoint. This time we stayed in the palace, which was gorgeous. We barely left the hotel over the 4 days we spent and it was delightful. The Spa has now been redone, which was amazing. We can’t wait to return!"
"This hotel is one of a kind in the world. The very best of this hotel is its hospitality, the kindness of the staff, and the history the palace radiates. The restaurants are a nice place to dine. I was really glad that I got a room upgrade. Roomservice was very good, even the staff of the Souk supplied room service. I had a foot injury, every staff member that saw me stumbling, asked if they could be of any help. The host of the Souk send for me an ice pack to my room. Even my Rose petal ice cream was sent to my room upon my request. When i was sitting in the Harbour bar i asked my unfinished drink to be sent to the Souk restaurant so i could drink it there. The bar tender himself brought my drink to my table. I was very happy to see this kind of service. "
"Top of the class, creme de la creme of hotels in India. Looked after like a celebrity. Amazing food. Amazing staff. Truly the best hotel in India. Would stay here every time I come to Mumbai. Would come to Mumbai only to stay at this hotel.  "
Extremely satisfied with our stay at this hotel and services provided by the hotel. We had the opportunity to stay in the Palace wing of the hotel. where the rooms are with very high quality wooden furniture.Antique interiors throughout the hotel and antique furniture displayed at various floors in the palace wing are really worth to see. Heritage Walk organized by the Hotel gives you a chance to know history of this hotel. Behaviour of staffs are very cordial and supportive
the experience is a life time memory the care the love and the pampering they shower on you is out of this world every time I stay in the taj they exceed my expectations . the rooms are classic with everything you could want and more
"Loved everything about the Tah Mahal Palace Hotel.  The hight tea was especially wonderful.  The manager Beauty, was simply fantastic.   The entire wait staff were all attentive and warm.  Perfect visit.  Perfection."
"Right from the booking, leading up to the check in and finally the checkout, everything was perfect and all the people involved with all the activities here were top notch professionals with an amazing understanding of customer service. The front desk staff was generous enough to accommodate me in the old wing, thus adding one more memory to be cherished for ever. This is a dated review, as I had travelled in 2016....had missed reviewing it earlier but the two nights spent there are still very fresh in my memory as is the pleasant experience of have dined at the shamiana restaurant."
"Good hotel.Nice location.Friendly staff.Had a short stopover. I must say,old is gold. The beauty of the hotel is one of a kind,with tight security for obvious reasons Rooms were good,lobby was beautiful with good food Will visit soon"
"It's an awesome place to visit. We had dinner here and quality was top notch infact price was top notch, too :p. If you go there don't forget to try their tea. I'm a big of their tea. View is simply awesome from the restaurant."
Taj never fails to impress. They have the most courteous staff and the food is great. They take extra care if you’re travelling with a child and the smallest of details are given attention to. We were upgraded to the suite room from the club room with no extra cost and were even provided complimentary lounge facilities. The hotel gives you the royal feels with an old world charm of its own. No other hotel can even match their hospitality. I’d recommend it 200%!
"it was a warm stay and a family gathering , all visitors had enough to compliment , the ambience , the food , the courtesy , the serenity , it is indeed an ethnic experience by the Taj , a must stay for a short local holiday !!"
"Stayed here for 2 nights and it was no where near long enough. Everything from check in to check out was superb. Staff were friendly and helpful. The room was immaculate. Facilities were incredible. Food was to die for. Location is great for sightseeing, shopping and dining out. Definitely worth the money."
"It was really good to live in place which was on the dream list. More than anything it was a dream of kid in me who always thought it is impossible to enter this property for us. We chose to celebrate our anniversary & we felt welcomed. We were upgraded to palace though we booked room in tower. Early check in and late check out requests were accepted without any problems. Vinay was really nice and polite, he made sure our stay was great. They gave us surprise by decorating room & keeping cake in our room grinning_face_with_big_eyes"
The Taj Mahal Palace is a magnificent hotel filled with unrivalled charm. From our airport pick up right through to our check out the service we experienced was first class.   We stayed in the club rooms in the palace and wow we were mesmerized. The palace has an incredible atmosphere and you can feel and see the history all around you as you walk through the corridors. The club rooms are beautifully decorated and offer access to the palace lounge for afternoon tea and the sea lounge for pre-dinner cocktails and live entertainment. The lounges offered a huge variety of mouthwatering food and beverages. The dining experiences at the hotel are fantastic - we particularly enjoyed the tiffin at Masala Kraft. Breakfast was also great but for less hustle and bustle a good tip is to
Superb hotel set in a historic building with plenty of charm. It's within easy reach of Bandra which gives you access to some of Bombay's best night venues and boutique shops. The restaurants are simply fantastic. I have tried all the hotels in neighbouring Juhu and they are no where near the same standard. Since BKC is a little too far away from Bandra I would say that this hotel really is your best bet if you're looking for a 5 star experience and want a convenient location.  There was an issue during my stay (faulty aircon) which was just bad luck and not really the fault of the hotel. I must give kudos to Swati the guest relations manager; she offered me a remarkably generous compensation to resolve the issue. This was a very wise decision because Taj can now be assured of
"Being in the hospitality industry myself I understand what service means. Here during my stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel I experienced the best customer service ever. There was love and humbleness in each of the staff I met during my stay. My special thanks to the Housekeeper Vishank who kept our rooms tidy and thank you to Mahinder, Piran and the front desk who assisted during the check in & check out process and to Michelle who welcomed us. Would love to stay here again when the business brings me back to Mumbai and once with my family too  Thank you to all the Team "
"We went for afternoon tea to the Sea Lounge on the first floor of the hotel ...... no reservation is required for High Tea and rge gist is £25 per person.   The Sea Lounge overlooks the sea and if you are there as the sun goes down the view is breath taking. The lounge holds 100 people.  There were at least 10 members of perfectly uniformed staff, fresh flower arrangements everywhere with fine China and pure white linen on the table. The High Tea consists if chicken on sticks, tandoori fish, quiche, stuffed croissants, open sandwiches, cold fresh sandwiches made to order, 10 types of sweet tarts, 10 large desserts and sweet meats.  Hot and cold drinks are served to the table and the good is buffet style so eat ad much as you like or want.  It is so so delicious  ...... enjoy it"
"On our arrival from  Airport to your  hotel we were not allowed to enter into the hotel and hesitated. Then I said we are your guests,we made reservations. Then they allowed us. I don't why. After that every thing was nice. We have been honoured with  Basil garland and given welcome drinks. Our room was lightly decorated and  balloons  were kept. Overall our stay was amazing. "
I have had multiple trips to India and have stayed in different types of hotels.  But Taj gave me the best experience of life. I am really impressed by the lovely Indian cuisines served and the Indian culture. I highly recommend everyone to stay at this hotel who visits India next time.
"Obviously, its the Taj Palace - so we had high expectations - but boy-oh-boy how we were not disappointed. Everbody; from check-in, restaurant staff, pool side, room staff, consierge, and security were spot on. It was so obvious to us that all staff were genuinely and sincerely concerned to ensure we enjoyed every tiny aspect of our stay. The atmosphere in the breakfast room was a delightful way to start the day; calm and helpful, topped off with the sunrise over the gateway (see pics).  The room was fantastic and everything about the public areas felt luxurious and relaxed. Don't know how to describe it but there was something unique, something inherently special about the place. I felt this was most evident during the early evening; something a bit buzzy and classy about the"
"Hands down one of the best places I've ever stayed in! I could sit here and write a roaring review from the moment I stepped in and throughout my 4 day stay, but people would be bored to death. I will say though that if you have the luck, ability or will to stay here, you will not forget the experience for years after. Staff: straight 10, Environment: 10, Service: 10, F&B: 10, Vibe: 10, Aesthetics: 10! Extra perk is the butler service. What you can expect above all though, is love, love for you, love for the place, love oozing from every single action the staff perform. Every day you will have a surprise, or more, waiting for you in your room. Flowers, arrangements, even your laundry comes in a box wrapped like a present of sorts. Definitely dont miss a dinner at the Massala"
"Situated directly over the road from the Gateway to India, this hotel has great rooms with the perfect view. The hotel restaurants are good and the bar is also good with a nice selection of single malt whiskies. The staff are very friendly and are eager to please their customers."
"Luxurious, magnificent and grand architecture. Amazing view from the top. Priceless location. Visited for business meetings in April. The customer service is signature Taj. Really proud that we have this brand to call our own. Kudos!"
"We stayed at this hotel 4 nights in February 2019.  Our room was very nice and the staff members were excellent. The reason for only rating it as ""very good"" is because of the International restaurant on the main floor of the hotel. The staff were very nice however the food was poor for a famous five star hotel.  For example there was never any bread at the table and when we asked for a bun with our spaghetti they told us they did not have any.  How sad!"
"It was a great experience in Taj, from check-in to food to buffet, everything was too good, nicely served, will visit for next time soon, Thanks a lot Taj for this wonderful experience. just bit pricly. "
This place is sooooo amazing with the kind of culture as they welcome guests with a Tulsi Mala. This Place welcomes large number of guests from other countries so you get to experience that too. Specially rooms with sea view are just wow. That adds to the beauty of the place.
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The experience was super awesome, right from check in to check out. The staff was very very warm and overall service experience was signature Taj. We stayed in the new Tower wing on the 15th floor. The view was simply superb from there. The room was very spacious and cosy. Sleep quality was excellent. Free wi fi was quite fast. Bathroom was also quite big and very clean. Had a good time eating at couple of their restaurants. They have about 8-10 different restaurants to choose from. The swimming pool was also superb. Overall had a wonderful experience and had a memorable wedding anniversary, courtesy Taj !!!! "
Thank you Taj for yet another great and memo  stay. The hospitality and warmth were overwhelming. It is always a pleasure a stay at the majestic Taj. Looking forward to my future stays at the iconic hotel
"Our Cruise Ship was only in Mumbai for one day and we just had to visit this iconic Hotel. It is stunning in every aspect . Elegant and spacious public areas and the bar / public lounge with views overlooking The Gateway to India is a must. Drinks and snacks really good and reasonably priced. Will revisit, but this marvellous city and country deserve a longer stay."
"I was tossing it up between the Taj and the Oberoi when I had to go to Mumbai, however I chose the historic wing in the Taj (my wife recommended the newer section as she has stayed several times over the last 7-8 years) and I had a very pleasant stay. It happened to be Diwali when I was there and as the hotel is pitched directly opposite the Gateway of India the place was packed, however the hotel entrance was well marshalled and it never felt hassled.   The hotel itself is the epitome of a 'grand old dame' having been rock solid through many different transitions of India since it opened in 1903, and whilst the old wing is showing some age in certain areas I do think that it is in keeping with the experience - the grand staircases, the old school bathrooms and acres of carpet. "
"Our stay at The Palace was perfect from the moment we were warmly welcomed when we arrived, being given a beautiful suite, the oasis of the pool, food, and most importantly the staff.  We will will remember our stay at The Taj forever and didn’t want it to end so we are going back later today for one more night!   Thank you Taj and staff especially Natasha our guest experience manager for a truly memorable stay. We really can feel the Taj when we close our eyes... thanks again xx (334)"
"This is one of the most visited and sought a place in Mumbai. I have not got an opportunity to go inside, but I am sure it will be a gem inside. The architecture looks beautiful. You can also visit Gateway of India and Elephanta Caves."
"So glad we decided to stay at this hotel.  The facade is beautiful, right on the waterfront outside the Gateway of India.  We were collected from the airport and staff were waiting for our arrival. We were swiftly taken straight to our gorgeous suite for private check in.  The suite was amazing - comfortable lounge opening to a study area then through to a separate dining room with nearly 360 views of the sea. Following on to our large bedroom and huge bathroom. Balconies led off from bedroom and lounge.   Also included were our wonderful butlers. Always on hand to do or sort anything. ( don’t think we quite used them enough). After a long day of walking the city coming home to a wonderful soothing salt and rose foot bath with moisturiser to follow was bliss.  Often a bath with"
"it was an absolute gem of a place to visit, India being by birthplace, it was really nice to go back to the homeland and get first-hand experience in exploring the 7th wonder of the world. Great people and the hotel service was really nice too all thanks to trip advisor."
"This is the second time we stayed at The Taj Palace (last time we were upgraded) and we were so looking forward to coming back, due to our previous experience but something had changed and it felt that the palace had lost some of its charm.  We had two rooms booked, one for 3 nights & the second for 4 nights. Whilst check in was smooth, we were given the wrong room (for the shorter stay) whilst it wasn’t a problem it was slightly annoying that we had to move our stuff on the final day. We spoke to reception about this but the girl simply just shrugged her shoulders at us!   Breakfast was good but again wasn’t as great as our first experience. It was very busy, but this was simply due to the sheer amount of people who are upgraded to the palace and the breakfast service staff"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is the most elegant and beautiful hotel I ever stayed at. Unfortunately only for one nigth, but still unforgettable. Hope to come back one day and stay for a longer period. Surroundings, both inside the hotel and outside in the garden are beautiful and the people working at the hotel are very nice and helpful. Service is awesome and you feel very welcome during the stay."
"Got a smiling welcome by Varun & a nice room offered by Aushotosh made checkin quite comfortable & instant.   Durga & her team in house keeping left no stone unturned for getting best of services making my room stay homely.  Meeting Rahil made the fatigue of journey washed away in seconds.  I really envy the superb energy of Mahtaab through out the long days & late evenings, whenever I passed from the lobby, I always found her smiling & chatting with guests with full of positive vibes throughout the day. I am sure this attitude of staff works as catalyst for guests in erasing out work stress & feeling homely.  As usual lovely experience in Sea Lounge with best of services by Taxi, Aniket, Jagdish, Gaurav & all with best of dishes made by chef Agashe.  Roy took extra care at"
"I used to stay in the old section of the Taj in the late 90's and also the new tower. We were not disappointed, again the service is of such high quality, it is just wonderful. Congratulations to the leadership and the team that make the stay so pleasant. High quality place."
From check in to check out all the services at this hotel are exceptional.  All the reataurants are excellent and the pool is a paradise.  The rooms are very comfortable and the customer service is wonderful 
"It’s was a group visit. Understand, it has two distinct properties, one the heritage building and other is the Taj Mahal tower onto the right. Rates of both are very different. So be sure of what you are booking. The experience, right from the start was great. The reception and hospitality of Taj is outstanding. They don’t have buffet on weekdays. So plan your food accordingly. The location couldn’t be better. It’s right in front of Gateway of India. While lot of clubs and pub are in walking distance. There is also a heritage tour in afternoon. Be sure to book for it as it only has 20 vacancies and it’s on first come first serve basis. This tour will give you a good insight. Also, there is a small memorial on right side of reception dedicated to 26/11. If not part of package,"
"Where to start !! Airport pickup hassle free, nice air conditioned car, helpful driver. Check in we were made to feel like celebrities. All the information we needed, relaxing and helpful. The room was perfect.  Attention to detail amazing, room was clean and view of gateway brilliant. The comfortableness of the bed was the only downside as a little too hard for me. The food for the high tea, cocktail hour was beautiful. The breakfast amazing choice. We ate at the Turkish restaurant which in our view let the place down a little. Service was not great and neither was attention to detail. The overall experience was truly awesome and it is a tick off my bucket list !!"
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai on April 23, 2019. We are frequent travelers and can say for a fact that we had an amazing experience at this hotel. The staff and check in team were so helpful and professional. Everyone spoke English. We stayed in Rooms 256 and 257. The rooms were lovely and well appointed. The views were incredible!  The most amazing thing happened! We were blessed with a delightful and very attentive Butler. Yes, we had a butler - amazing! His name was Manoj. Within an hour of our check in, Manoj arranged a lovely dinner for us in the Japanese restaurant on site. The food was over the top delicious and we had a wonderful family dinner with the best wait staff. After dinner, Manoj took us on a tour of the hotel ( which is so incredible and"
"Had booked 1 night  for my parents to celebrate my Father's 70th birthday and had requested them to do some special arrangements if possible. And I must say that we were more than satisfied with the hospitality and arrangements. First of all they upgraded the Stay to Suite, without even requesting !!! My father entered the room and it was decorated with balloons and they kept on making him special by giving Bouquets and Cakes throughout the day...I couldn't be more thankful. We are based in Mumbai only and my Father always had a dream of staying at 'THE TAJ' and his wish was more than fulfilled and we are very thankful to the Taj and especially Mr Mukul Kadaba for making sure that his stay was memorable  "
"There are 5 star hotels and there are exceptional hotels. From the moment of arrival, or pick up at the airport, the levels of attention and service are exceptional, the building itself beautiful and the location the best in Mumbai. Upgrade to Taj Level with sea view worth the extra and makes the stay truly memorable. Access to lounges included, breakfast buffet superb, complimentary afternoon tea. Every member of staff polite, knowledgeable and friendly. The exceptional service does not end at check-out. Book a hotel car to the airport and you are greeted at the airport entrance by a member of hotel staff who escorts you through the airport and check-in all the way to security. Staff a credit to the hotel and great ambassadors for India. Would definitely stay again if returning"
"It can be difficult for a hotel to provide ""attentive"" service, where everyone knows your name, without it being a little bit creepy. The staff at the Taj Mahal Palace are great - the hotel has very serious security and you know that there are people watching, but when a staff member addresses you as ""Mr Adventure"", it feels correct.  On a tangent - the breakfast buffet at the Taj Mahal Palace is fantastic.   "
"We stayed at the Taj Palace in early April 2019. Our stay was marked by excellent service from the moment we entered.  We were exhausted and tired after our flight and drive and we were made comfortable right away in the lounge. The staff went above and beyond what I expected. We enjoyed the breakfasts. Everywhere we went in the hotel, the staff was always helpful and smiling. Such a pleasure. Pallas and Varun at checkout were exemplary. My only regret was not getting everyone’s names to thank them personally. The hotel always smelled wonderful.  I always wanted to stay at the Taj Palace and am so glad I finally got to do this. Thank you. "
"I stayed in a Palace Suite for two weeks, and thoroughly enjoyed the stay.  We ate at various restaurants within the property, but always return to the Souk on top of the Taj Tower.  Our room was lovely and quiet on the 6th floor which we prefer above other floors, the butler was more than helpful when a critical accident happened to a white shirt!  I have no complaints, in fact the service was superb.  I would like to say that although hidden away below ground is the Taj Salon, it gives great service, and I wish they were allowed to give full body massages in addition to the various treatments currently permitted.  I always wait for my pedicure until I arrive at this hotel as it is exceptionally good.  Thank you Taj for another great stay."
"It was a weekend stay and we really loved the stay. Hospitality was excellent and staff went out of the way to help for every little thing. Rooms, amenities, location, and food everything was awesome."
"This was our second visit to the Taj Palace after a fabulous first experience. Disappointingly it didn’t match our first experience. This flagship hotel was poor at best.  From the service to the food let alone pool side . We ate in the masala Kraft inviting friends from Mumbai to celebrate their imminent wedding, the quality of the food was really poor and we did not enjoy the experience. When we attended the golden Dragon which we had made reservations for staff walked past us didn’t acknowledge us and we waited for some time until staff eventually gave us eye contact. We were swiftly then seated - it wasn’t busy. To be fair the food when it arrived was decent but then our plates weren’t cleared away for over 15 minutes and only when we asked. Shamiana was the worst poor food"
We went at 5.30am to see the sunrise over the Taj Mahal and it was an experience that will stay with us forever. It was quieter at that time of day so we were able to get better photographs with very few other tourists in. We paid a photographer to take some pics of us both and it was really cheap for 20 photos in a presentation photo book so really worth it. The Taj itself is so well preserved which could be down to the fact that you have to wear shield covers but we didn't mind that at all. You cant visit Agra without seeing this iconic breathtaking building. 
"From the moment we landed at the airport, this hotel catered to every need and whim of our stay. We were greeted warmly at the terminal by our private chauffeur and whisked away to the most beloved building in Bombay. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the entire staff and shown incredible love. Every single staff member greeted us when we walked by, asked us if we would like something and answered any and all questions we had—which there were many. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the old world charm is wonderful. The pool, the lounges, the restaurants, all top class. Our last night they placed a warm foot bath with rose petals scattered throughout our room, just because. This was leaps and bounds the most amazing and memorable stay I’ve ever had at at hotel, and"
"From the moment we were picked up at the airport by the hotels driver we were reared incredibly well. Hotel is stunning, art lines the corridors, a day around the pool was like an oasis.  Attentive staff highly trained. Our butler even delivered a iced written cake and flowers on one of our Birthdays... you must stay here, worth upgrading to the club rooms for the extra amenities and service.  "
Luxurious place to visit with family or as a couple... Loved the stay here. Was here for my 4th anniversary.. the view from the rooms is breath taking. Would like to visit here once again with my family
"What a wonderful stay Taj mahal might me not the newest fanciest hotel but its a trip into another century where all the palace hotels around the world were the home of famous writers, actors and politicians.   The building itself is an institution, the location is perfect and service is top.  That this has its price comes without saying but that more than fair!  Dont miss to have afternoon tea or brunch at the sea lounge or have a swim in the pool in the morning!"
"Two glorious nights here in March with immaculate service in beautiful surroundings - I hadn’t realised that there were so many antiques and art in the palace wing.  The room was really well maintained and the staff even treated me to a rose scented foot bath when they saw me hobbling from blisters.  The breakfast was sumptuous, a blow dry in the salon excellent.  I enjoyed every minute from relaxing by the pool (and barbecued fish by the pool) to afternoon tea to drinks and canapés... only one thing that marred it was that the dinner in the Indian restaurant was not as good as it could have been.  Many thanks to all, I will return but will need to save up a bit first!"
"I stayed at the Taj on a business visit recently. I had been on my bucket list, given the history of the hotel. I had high expectations, and wasn’t disappointed. The staff were exceptional and the Taj Mahal was beautiful. My only criticism was that my breakfast buffet, unlike the rest of my experience, wasn’t exceptional. I will be back!"
"My wife and I went here with a plan to eat an Indian meal. We looked at the menus to the left side of reception and found them too expensive to justify. We later discovered from our son who visited last year that there were cheaper options available to eat at the hotel! We just had a drink on this ocassion therefore. The toilets were the most plush, luxurious toilets I have ever seen and worth visiting just for the experience. We had a drink in the hotel's only bar which is also close to the very expensive restaurants. I must admit I was somewhat underwhelemed. Not only was it the most expensive drink I have ever bought- I had a draught Kingfisher lager, 0.5 litre, my wife a cocktail which looked and tasted nice. The bill was approximately £25!! I wanted to use the hotel's wifi,"
"We visited the Taj palace and were swept away from the moment we stepped out on the forecourt. This hotel has got everything spot on. Did not expect such grandeur in such a busy cosmopolitan city. Service was amazing. Booked a club room and the club access is definitely worth the extra spend. The club lounge was superb and access to a quiet drink was excellent. The pool was busy and noisy, not for a quiet dip. Restaurant selection amazing. No need to leave the hotel for any reason! Planning a future visit just to stay at the hotel and experience it all again...not worth staying anywhere else in Mumbai!!!"
"Upon arrival you are greeted by very friendly staff; instantly all staff addressed us by our names throughout our stay, which was very personable for such a large hotel! The room was very nice and very clean. The toiletries available are very nice and also the coffee facilities etc..   The breakfast buffet was amazing and to date, we've not had another as good!  Overall, FANTASTIC stay and I'd like to stay in a Taj hotel again!"
"It was an excellent stay and the experience is memorable.  Needless to say the location, right in front of The Gateway of India, this is an iconic property.  The best part is the hospitality extended by all staff members; every service came with a smile and was quick and prompt.  The breakfast at Shamiyana was a feast; the wine lounge on the ground floor was an added advantage. Proud to be part of Tata Family, I am with Tata Capital.  Though not recollecting names of many staff members who gave excellent service, my poor memory, the one who helped me for the check in was Mr. Rishi and escorted to the room, worth mentioning his smiling service."
"I am a loyal supporter of the Taj, have been with them for yr.  My recent visit with them was far from enjoyable.  Stayed at the Palace wing, From day 1 till i checked out, there were issues with the room.  The only good thing was the butler service..."
"Absolutely incredible. Incredible story behind it, after seeing the Taj Mahal in person up close this hotel was so similar and the design is spectacular. Everything about this hotel is truly amazing and known all the history behind it makes it even more remarkable. Beautiful hotel, stunning rooms and tasty delicious food! (The lamb burger especially was the best burger I’ve had throughout my five weeks of traveling through India) 10/10 everything was outstanding. 6 star in my eyes, pure luxury. Hands down. Best hotel in Mumbai! "
Overall a great hotel. Lots of history to it and a brilliantly kept hotel. The staff are brilliant and impeccable level of service. It’s the TAJ and you can expect unparalleled hospitality compared to anywhere across the globe. This is a gold standard hotel in terms of hospitality and upkeep . The bathrooms could be better but they are more than sufficient. The noise levels in the afternoon were a little too much as they were running maintenance tasks. 
Good and comfortable stay. Prices are little bit on the higher side specially the meals. Overall good experience.Nice Hotel and very comfortable stay. Would recommend anyone to enjoy this hotel for a good experience. No doubt Taj Mumbai is one of the best properties of Taj Hotel Group.  
"Legacy can’t be achieved overnight. It is nurtured over the years. That’s Tajmahal Palace.  The legacy n value can very well be seen n experienced in every team member of the organisation.  Wonderful example of architecture n interiors which is amalgamation of Peshwa style layout, European specifications is in perfect harmony.  All in all, it’s a perfect definition of luxury."
"Popped in for food whilst in Mumbai recently, I had one of the best mutton curries I've ever had. My son loves his pizza & the wife had some freshly baked bread. All good was excellent.  Staff were professional & friendly with a clean high standard restaurant. I'd happily recommend."
Called in at lunch time for a drink. You have to go through airport style security in the car park prior to entering. One inside you can only marvel at the spender. Sheer opulence. We went into the bar and the service was excellent. But at a price!! At £10 a pint you pay for excellent service and a jar of peanuts. The whole experience keeps the rif raf at bay.
"This upscale hotel offers a unique combination of being incredibly well run, comfortable grandeur but at the same time, extremely warm and friendly.  You truly feel you are ""home away from home""  The location could not be better.  The breakfasts are delectable....the hotel has a wide array of restaurants, an inviting swimming pool.....and other relaxing public spaces.  If you are visiting Mumbai, I heartily recommend this hotel"
Great place to be in if you think of staying in Mumbai. Views and proximity to everything is great. Staff is helpful and may tell you about cricketers and celebrities staying in the hotel. So who knows you may bump into one of them while waiting for your taxi at the reception.
Stayed in the new tower. Great view of India gate. Rooms are standard hotel rooms nothing special. Breakfast buffet was average we had much better in Bhopal. It’s fine it is not great crowded lobby. The staff are good they are the only thing that makes it special.
Fabulous place to stay and enjoy the hotel room and all the restaurants it has to choose from.  Top notch experience from beginning to end.  Very perosinalized service and very safe place to stay.  Loved the shopping and variety of stores inside the property too.  
"Love old hotels and was booked at Taj Mahal Tower but received an upgrade - so grateful! The hotel is beautiful, the pool area a pleasure (did yoga two mornings, sketched a picture in the garden by pool and swam every day). Breakfast was delicious and included a lovely view! Wedding reception below our room one evening and watched them set-up beautiful flower arrangements - but no impact from the music! A very special hotel that welcomes you, we even did the tour!"
We began working with 3EA as we were on a lookout for a permanent and successful solution. We were facing a lot of challenges within our organization and we were finding it difficult to identify the loopholes. The experts from 3EA made sure to identify the areas of problems and helped us restructure by helping us to deliver projects to clients on time.
"Taj Palace by far is one of the best hotels from the point of view of its location, ambience, grandeur and quality of service.  It has two wings Tower and Palace.  Both are excellent but Palace wing has that old charm.    Breakfast is generally excellent but i took in Sea Lounge where possibly the number of items were less than the other location.  It is an experience you must have."
Very good hotel and services but during the night a party inside the hotel made the windows of the room vibrate all night long for the loud music. This is unacceptable in such a hotel.  Everything else was good 
"Wonderful hospitality. Esp Rina Sheth from guest relation team is fabulous . She took great care of us making our anniversary so special. Imtiaz, shahid from gym, whole spa team Nikhil , Yogesh from pool side the whole taj team is very warm and commendable. They all made us feel so comfortable just like a family. Taj has awesome restaurants like wasabi, shamiana, masala craft , golden dragon they all are our favourite choices in dining. It is one of the finest hotel we have visited throughout the world."
Incredibly skilled staff making the stay perfect. Afternoon tea overlooking the gate of India is a must and the hotel breathes history. Quite smoking area in the courtyard. Sure to come back for a longer stay. 
"On Good Friday bearing the hot Bombay sun we took our 18 month old son to experience a boat ride around the Gateway of India and hospitality at the Taj- a childhood ritual for my husband and me.  We reached around 12 - 12 30 gave our car for valet and made a reservation for lunch.  The hotel was really busy with weddings and guests. Realising that we had left our son's cap in the car and requested your security in charge to bring just that for us instead of bringing back the car. He was very co operative and even asked us to sit in the lobby (which we didn't do) and waited for 20 minutes. When it finally came and I thanked him and left. Another guy at the gate,unfortunately didn't take his name said we cannot leave the premises until we took the car. We explained the entire"
"We stayed in the Palace, not the Tower. The greeting was warm and so personal; the room was beautiful and modern; the service is absolutely brilliant and every single member of the very large staff is on the lookout to find a way to add to your comfort and enjoyment of your stay. It was an amazing experience! And, on top of that, the location is great."
"We stayed at the Taj 11 years ago,since then the tower wing has been added to form a complete and wonderful hotel. It is historic  imposing and iconic and the setting and location are breathtaking. The gardens and pool area are tantric The service is faultless and is delivered by staff who you feel have a real concern to male sure that you fully enjoy the Taj experience . I know I am running out of superlatives so to finish it’s a truly wonderful experience . "
 I was in Taj for my wedding event .but there is no one is to help here properly. The manager of here Mr.mohit(cristal and ball room) is a very rude guy and not co-operative. He has no idea about how to handle the client. Seriously not happy with the services..Plz someone will take action on him.and the security guards also not comparative. everytime they being high and rude.. 
"This is a luxury Hotel second to none, we stayed for two nights prior to getting onboard the Maharajas express. It is situated just opposite the Gateway to India in a prime location , on arrival w were lucky enough to get a room upgrade to a junior suite and what a suite . It is very difficult to do full justice to the Hotel , its décor is stupendous ( the Hotel is 115year old ) the service is fantastic and the food caters for all tastes . We were inundated ( in  a nice way ) with the offer of help as soon as we entered the Hotel . Our room was checked at least four times every afternoon to make sure that we had everything that we wanted , I must say that I have never experienced service like this. There are several restaurants that provide everything from classic Indian cuisine"
"I spent my previous weekend at Taj Palace. Once in a while I do get carried away and splurge on myself. Ofcourse credit card bills do become a challenge later. But so be it.   The landmark hotel with its ornate architecture, its Art Deco stairs and stone carvings takes you back in time. And outstanding service of the hotel takes you back in time where you are made to feel like a King with entire staff at your beck and call.   The checkin was smooth and the entire place was smelling of heavenly roselike smell. Staff won’t share the details of perfume but it certainly was close to Rose.   Our room facing the Gateway of India gave a view of Arabian Sea. And the rooms are large - these are not comparable with pigeonholes that are called suites in  modern hotels.   The high tea at"
"The Taj is a special place - the history of the hotel, the quality of service, food and the building itself is beyond anything I’ve ever experienced! Thank you to the whole team who even gave me a special birthday surprise. "
"Taj Mahal Palace is probably one of the worlds best luxury hotels. It is not a business hotel but a luxury hotel in the middle of a huge city but overlooking the water. The hotel has all the trimmings of real luxury, including lots of staff and excellent service. But it is at the same time an Indian hotel and you can’t help feel that when small quirky things happen. The rooms are large and well appointed and all the facilities are of a very high standard, making it an oasis in the middle of Mumbai."
"Stayed here for two nights and it was amazing!  Such a fabulous hotel, steeped in history and in a prime position in Mumbai. Right from the check in, the staff were brilliant and we were lucky enough to be given an upgrade to from a Club Room to a Suite, it was huge and so luxurious; it was a shame to go out really! Breakfast in Shamaina was a great start to the day with a  lovely view of the Gateway from our table, the selection and quality of food was fantastic and of course, the service was so good; even the chef comes out to chat to you! I enjoyed the Yoga sessions on the lawn in the mornings as well as swimming in the lovely pool; my husband also rated the gym highly. We had high tea and also pre dinner drinks and canapes in the Club Lounge and both were such a treat. I"
"Such a beautiful Hotel......we went there for High tea, there was such a fantastic selection of traditional and Indian delicacies, we really were spoiled for choice. The service is a mixture or waiter service and buffet.  Ambiance was great with a pianist playing throughout. Also a great photo opportunity of the gateway to India.  Prices are extremely well priced in comparison to high teas in other parts of the world. Highly recommend "
The staff was very polite and willing to please at all time. They were always smiling. The architecture of the building and craftsmanship were amazing and to think people then did not have tools and equipment to create such beauty. Best of India..... Everything was awesome. 7 star
"The hotel, location, amenities are really good, but the service provided are so disappointing.Let me write in detail, the staff were so prominent in not allowing outside ,which lead to multiple discussions with the duty managers and they had their own unknown reasons.I accepted it and the thing which surprised me was, that when i witnessed some foreigners of different skin tone where allowed to bring in outside food. And i felt it to be so discriminative nature towards and Indian citizen.Hotels can take there their own stands, but should make sure the rules and regulations are for all. Never expected these discriminative nature from the Tag group of hotels."
"Enjoyed an unadulteratedly luxe stay at the TAJ Mumbai. Historic Wing room - very atmospheric, and a superior choice to that of the Tower Wing - where these rooms were decked out in a Scandinavian pared back style not in keeping with the luxe TAJ look that harks back to palatial India.  Only drawback in the Historic Wing room is the bathroom. There’s all the bells and whistles. Great oversized bath, shower and everything’s marble clad, but the sink is impossibly wide and hard to lean over to perform one’s ablutions and there is zero counter space to place all of one’s toiletries. Instead there are glass shelf inserts but these are small and the hairdryer and my toiletries bag kept falling out of it.. Decent sized room with rose petals strewn in the hallway, giant bed, a/c but"
"I am a regular guest at the Taj Palace Hotel, and every stay seems to be like a new stay with extraordinary and unique experience. I have visited so many hotels in the world, and for me it is definitely the best and the ultimate hotel I have ever stayed. The standards of the hotel are so high that one gets the feeling that the hotels always redefines the meaning of best service and brings it to very high levels. "
Undoubtedly one of the best hotels in the world. 6+ star Indian Hospitality at all levels. First class rooms with Views of the pool area or of course the Arabian Sea / Gate of India.  The history is evident all over the hotel and it just feels special to stay and dine here. Location is also good with Gate of India and boats only meres away and some good bars and shopping in the area behind the hotel.
A legendary and elegant hotel that is still one of the best hotels in the world. The room in the palace wing was quiet and comfortable. The service was outstanding - not only at the reception desk but also in the room and in the restaurants. The breakfast and the afternoon tea were awesome. It is certainly a place to come back !
"From the moment we arrived we knew we were going to have an incredible stay. We were met by a beautifully dressed front desk young lady called Priyanka Bhakti and her warmth and happiness at welcoming us was so lovely. She took us to our room where she had upgraded us to have a sea view but also a perfect view of the Gateway to India. My children had messaged the hotel to sneakily inform them it was my birthday, and the bedroom was decorated with balloons, flowers and was beautiful. I can’t thank her enough for all she did and so much more, she went above and beyond. We ate at three of the hotels restaurants which I will review separately but all were faultless. The pool area was stunning and the staff working there were attentive. The hotel was beautifully maintained and no"
"From check-in through to checkout, this hotel ticks all the boxes. An amazing sanctuary amidst the balmy, hot, hustle and bustle of incredible Mumbai. We were upgraded from a club room to a suite which set the tone for an awesome two day stay. From collection at the airport as promised to gin and tonics by the pool, high teas in the palace lounge and breakfasts at the sea lounge, the staff were friendly and attentive and quality and service was second to none. Our Butler was efficient but unobtrusive. The heritage and historical architecture and detail makes this hotel worth visiting when in Mumbai. Congratulations Taj Mahal Palace. "
The Taj service is not like to be before I didn't except this type of service blus the staff talking with each other in their Hindi language against the gest and we as arab we know Hindi language very well 
The flowers in the public areas are exquisite!  I have never seen a more beautiful display of nature’s bounty!  Our room was lovely and had a great view over India’s Gate.  All the service people were first rate.  Truly wanted to make us happy!  Highly recommend!!
"I truly enjoyed my stage at the Taj. I was counting on the ambience and the sense of history of a heritage and destination hotel and was not disappointed. I still remember the lovely jasmine scent pervading the lounge and the design and architecture that really made my stay there. Lovely staff, too, thank you!"
"Excellent service, Royal treatment to the guest, Daily change of decor, very pleasing ambience. The breakfast was yummmmmy, mouth licking lunch, you get to see traditional welcome, with Tulsi mala, tika on forehead. Loved the experience will cherish it for life time."
This is my best stay ever in Taj Mahal mumbai and got sea view room. Can't express my feeling as it's absolutely wow experience. My family had a great and memorable and spent quality time for 2 days. Thanks to entire team of coffee shop and specially Udai for taking care of us.  Salute to and it's really a Taj of all hotels.
"We came to Mumbai as 4 couples from the UK. We all arrived separately for some it was a quick break,for some it was the final leg of their journey.We opted for a pick up from the airport which was effortlessly achieved by our guide approaching us at the luggage belt and dealing with the luggage.On arrival check in was from our room and the rest of the stay was very fluid."
"The Location could not be better, right overlooking the Gateway of India which was most fascinating from the sunrise at dawn breaks till night time. We stayed in the original wing with sea view, very beautiful room. Daily buffet breakfast is served daily at the cafe overlooking the Gateway, with both Western and Indian choices. The pool bar & cafe, reception, cocktail area looked fascinating, great ambience. Lots of nice famous shops along both sides of the corridor.  The only hiccup was we had to walk  their long corridor to get to our cars at the other end of the building by the Tower. But we do understand their safety concerns after those tragic incidents, notice the security officers/soldiers stationed at the back of the hotel. Colaba market is nearby you can walk out to"
They provide a very awesome service I love it and the hotel room is upgraded the staff member is well trained and there is a very beautiful hotel i like the hotel very much and the room is very freshive no smell
"The hotel itself is splendid and a must see if your in Mumbai. The hotel inside is amazing and has a huge historical significance so we decided to visit it and have afternoon tea, while ashore from our cruise. The restaurant is very nice but nothing special, at the time of our visit there was scaffolding at the windows that spoilt the view of the bay.We arrived early as you cant book so be warned.However we were there for 2 hours and there was always a few empty tables which surprised us as it was not a particularly large restaurant. The service was awful to be honest and we had to keep asking for everything right from the start which actually spoilt our experience as you don't expect this lack of service at such a well renowned hotel.We had to ask for drinks, top ups, more"
Taj Mahal palace hotel located in Mumbai it's lovely hotel I love it and this is my first visit in Mumbai and great to be enjoy there I love it  ...I love the room and good clean room and food is so yumm 
"Having travelled 18 days through India and staying in outstanding hotels, I feel I have left the best for last! This is a large international hotel literally opposite the Gateway to India monument. On arrival we are checked in in a small lounge as we’re staying in the traditional part of the hotel (the Towers part of the hotel adjoins this, but if you can afford the difference stay in the traditional part of the hotel). We are escorted up to our room by a delightful young lady who’s only raison d’être is to make us happy! The room is very well appointed. We are facing the pool with a city view that is absolutely fine. Of course the sea view is preferable but the budget was done by then! The bathroom is lovely and particularly I liked the corridor with the wardrobes that keep it"
Having stayed in the old wing of the Taj 40 years ago wanted to show my partner how nice it is and it did not dissapoint. Still a wonderful iconic building and the service levels are still way up there
"Arring in the middle of the night after a long flight we finally arrived at our destination.  A classic old world hotel built during an age of elegance.  We were kindly welcomed and taken to our room.  We stayed in the old wing which had wide hallways and relics from the past on display.  The room was lovely and faced the water and the Port of India Gate, another reminder of the past. The service was always impeccable.  Breakfast was a large buffet  of Indian and international's items.  I thought the rooms needed a little refreshing, but were lovely.  I did not see the rooms in the new wing so am unable to comment on them.  Great location   You can never go wrong with a Taj Hotel."
It's one of oldest properties of Mumbai suburban and its same place where 26/11 happen but no one can see any signs of the same ambience is very good you can have coffee in lobby no need to go to any restaurant
"On a first visit to India and the first hotel, we could not have been made more welcome. The hotel lives up to its reviews. It is expensive but worth it. We had a view of the Arabian sea and the gate of India and were made to feel very special as it was a birthday celebration. If the budget stretches this is a wonderful place to stay. Ate in both Souk and Golden Dragon. Both excellent. The 45 min hotel tour was interesting but slightly disappointing as we felt it could have had a little more depth. We were hoping to learn a bit more of the “behind the scenes” story. "
"Been to the Tag before but this time retuning from a cruise we stayed 4 nights and went touring India from there. The hotel is amazing the staff are so nice nothing is too much problem. Location is everything and from the hotel you can cover a large area of Mumbai by foot. Although a very busy city I felt perfectly safe. The hotel was a dream to come back to, very tranquil sitting around the pool in the shade was bliss with a large G&T . There are several restaurants within the hotel all of them I can highly recommend. If you have the chance to visit Mumbai you must call in and view the Taj it truly is Fantastic."
"The souk at the Taj Mahal hotel , Colaba , is a great place to entertain guests -  whether business or family . The food is good  and their service is outstanding.   As we were vegetarians, we asked the steward for advice . He was very good and offered us a sampler platter which was a meal by itself .   Highly recommend"
"After many visits to the palace wing pleased to say still outstanding. Discreet service , beautifully presented. I haven't stayed in Tower but if you have a choice, choose palace wing. Recommend swimming pool ... Unparalleled"
My room overlooked the Arabian sea and to the left was the Gateway of India. This hotel property is exquisite and the food and service unparalled. The streetscape below was full of action and i don't think Mumbaites ever go to sleep as there were people enjoying the sea all night .
This was the best one of the best I ever stayed in a hotel globally. Everything was perfect. The only thing that I would improve is the breakfast variety but still it was absolutely great. I urge everyone visiting Mumbai to stay at this hotel.
"We have travelled to 169 countries. I think this qualifies us to say this is the best property in thee world!!! The staff is trained so well and they embrace the experience and make it s obvious that they love their jobs.  Our room steward, AMOL, was amazing. Rose petals everywhere, little touches that we loved and always with such a smile and such a terrific attitude. Great breakfast in Sea Lounge. Ershad is a terrific server and has been there over 30 years. Prabhakar, chef, also over 30 years and makes amazing scrambled eggs with cheese and always knows what one wants, always making you feel special.  Palace Services, especially Janet, exceptional.  Room fabulous and bedding VERY comfortable. Worth upgrading to Palace level, the service is just so good as are the rooms.  "
"What an experience! From arrival we have been pampered. Ms Meghana Pitale looked after us like we were her best friend and I really want to thank her for the attentions she gave us. We have been given presents every single day of our stay from all staff: the room boy always had something for us, even the pool attendant offered us a coffee!! All we asked was immediately delivered. Only one think was missing: decaffeinated coffee!!! We could not find it anywhere, Taj Mahal or Starbucks or Costa, it seems like it is a forbidden item in India. Even at the airport it was not available. Jokes aside, thanks Taj Mahal for a fantastic stay."
"Great experience, good ambience, excellent rooms, Taj has upgraded us from Taj Tower to TAJ Palace which was a pleasant surprise to us. We had thoroughly enjoyed our stay at TAJ and would like to visit again...    "
"hotel is located few meters from the gate of India.   Public areas are amazing, luxury, relaxing and prestigious, full of glory and royalty.  BUT, the rooms are old, very simple and far away from the luxury of the public areas"
"we had a stay to celebrate birthday of my son ,cutie-pie darling Riyanssh, had an wonderful and awesome stay, amazing hospitality, we got beautiful surprises of balloons, gifts and cakes for him that was truly touching and enjoyed our stay with beautiful sea facing rooms, thank you so much  to Meghana Pitale, Guest Service Supervisor,she was really very kind and caring and loving towards riyanssh and also thank you so much to  Satish Gaikwad, Chef Concierge - Concierge Desk he was also  really very kind and caring and loving towards riyanssh, "
"Have always wanted to stay at the iconic property, so finally had the chance and booked 2 nights in a Taj Club room with all the extras. Was so excited to be staying here as it was my dream. Jet Airways informed me that they had cancelled my fights offering no alternatives at 04:00 AM was due to be at the hotel at 08:55 same day. Called the hotel from Goa at 04:00 and explained to them my procurement. Was tole to call back at 09:30 when in house reservations opens to see what they could do regarding a refund. Called back and was told by DM it was policy to charge one nights accommodation, I did explain again it was not my fault, also said could the money be kept in credit as I was travelling back to India this November 2019 and could re book. Was told they would consider it. I"
"Such a nice, peaceful, and beautiful place. it has best swimming pool in south Mumbai, the best high tea, the best Asian restaurant, the best (albeit expensive) hotel shops. Service is phenomenal. Staff exude a palpable sense of pride and joy to be working here, and the memorial to all those who lost their lives protecting guests in the 2011 terrorist siege, including the hotel dog Lucy, is a moving tribute to the sense of family that permeates the Palace."
Memorable experience beyond expectation. The waiters and all staff know how to treat the guests and make them feel special. All very much in tune with the guests’ needs  Worth the price and a return trip Thank you to all that made this stay unique!
"Before I even checked into the hotel, about a few hours after cancellation, I begged for the hotel to allow me to cancel my booking. I wanted to cancel because I felt that the hotel lacked customer service.   I even went to great lengths, to speak to the General Manager of the Taj Palace, and he gave me no option to cancel, that he would charge my credit card for one night's stay if I did not check in. I begged and pleaded, I was in Malaysia at the time and had not even arrived in India. Since he gave me no other option, I had no choice but to check into the hotel.  Upon checking in to the hotel, the vibe was so sad, especially after the terrorist attack in 2010.   In 2017, my team and I had been human trafficked by terrorists, in the middle east, even though we were saved by"
The Taj has made our first trip to India unforgettable. After a delayed flight and long commute from the airport their warm welcome was much appreciated. They checked us in directly in the room which they have actually kindly upgraded making our stay magical. The service we received from day 1 has only been getting better through the trip. Highly recommend this Palace experience: we both managed to completely disconnect from work and the rest of the world to get the perfect break.
We had one after noon at Taj hotel Mumbai. Decor was amazing. Food was great. Display was beautiful. 100 items. View of India gate was perfect. Service was spotless. Once in a life time experience. two_hearts
"Checked in for one night and after 1000 hotel nights in the last 5 years, this is the first where we didn’t get a view - like no windows. Coupled with renovations and drilling that went on until 8pm, it brought the experience down a little. Hotel is beautiful and staff awesome but make sure you don’t get the luxury room. We booked on hotels.com and it doesn’t state NO. VIEW on the website but it does on the Taj’s so be careful. Check on the renovations too. Otherwise, great place to stay, just communications could have been better and I’d have upgraded and paid if I’d have known thumbs_up"
From the moment you enter and feel this amazing smell of luxury to the moment you check out and get a little gift coin to bring you luck everything about Taj Mahal hotel is amazing. You will never regret giving yourself one of the best hotel experiences possible. You don't have to think or worry about anything. Just trust yourself to them and go with the Taj frlow. Everything will be done for you even before you know you wanted it. :) Enjoy it as much as I did. x
"i was feeling like that i am in Paradise. The housekeeping staff in Taj is very efficient and they will maintain your room very well and fulfill all your needs. Staff is usually very courteous and receptive. Rooms are clean and well maintained. Food is Superb, delicious. Best Hotel."
"I was beyond impressed with the service, quality of facilities, food, and general ambiance of the Taj Palace.  The staff were incredible. The butler service made me feel like a princess.  The people assigned to me were attentive, without being intrusive, they were able to solve any issue I had, and they were able to anticipate my behaviours/needs after a very short time as a guest.   The smell in the hotel was delightful, the flowers beautiful, the sushi at the one restaurant - the best I've eaten. Thank you, I really hope to be back. I loved the breakfast chefs.  They went out of their way to make me the perfect India Dosa / Scrambled eggs.  Breakfast was the best meal of the day!"
"What an incredible hotel! From the moment you arrive until the moment you leave, you cannot fail to be impressed. Exceptional staff, care and attention to detail in every way. This iconic and indeed historic hotel cannot fail to appeal to the discerning traveller, with fantastic guest rooms and delightful furnishings. Comfort and luxury abound. Whilst we dined out on the evenings of our two night stay, the breakfast in the Sea Lounge was incredible, and I can only imagine that the food in the many on site restaurants would be of similar high quality. Lunch by the beautiful pool was lovely. Little touches from the staff, from the friendly greetings to the respect shown to their guests is impressive and nothing seems too much trouble. Loved this place, and as a final stop on our"
"Everything in this hotel was amazing ( except from the food at some of the restaurants ) You'll find much better food and cheaper just outside by following other trip advisers. The breakfast was outstanding though!! Still dreaming of the chai masala <3     We had a beautiful room overlooking the gateway of India with a nice little terrace where we enjoyed the memorial concert on the 25 th of November. The staff helped us with booking tours, really recommend the early bird fish market tour- amazing  Its a beautiful hotel, with an excellent pool/garden area, would love to come back!"
Just the most wonderful stay in a beautiful tower room overlooking the gateway to India. The food and wine were excellent and the staff fantastic. Gorgeous pool as well.  It is the most lovely hotel in every way. We had an incredible time.
"The Taj Mahal staff never fails to surprise us with their awesome hospitality and warm welcome. Our third stay at the Taj Mahal Palace, made us feel at home totally. We were upgraded to the Palace wing by Mr. Bony Thakkar as a goodwill gesture. The biggest comfort was having health faucet in the bathroom, the last time we stayed at the Tower wing, didn't have it, but they promptly fixed it upon our request. So I feel they really know how to keep the guests coming back. Keep up the excellent service. The turn down service is neat and makes the room cozy with little flower formations which keep the room fragrant. The breakfast at the Sea Lounge was excellent with fresh croissants served upon request, dosa & puri bhaji, basically i could have ordered anything and got it but we were"
We only stopped for lunch as my wife had promised her Aunt she would visit as her Aunt had done so decades earlier.  We explained this to the man at check-in who then took us on a very friendly and interesting tour of the hotel - such kindness in such a beautiful place.
"Absolutely perfect experience from the moment I arrived, until the moment I left.  The hotel has a classic elegance, yet is fresh and modern.  The rooms are large, comfortable, and beautifully appointed.  But what made my experience at the Taj one of my best hotel experiences ever, is the quality of the staff.  EVERYONE, from those that great you at the car, or escort you to your room, to the wait staff, concierge, or floor Butler, are kind, warm, beyond courteous, and truly go out of their way to make your stay special."
"Very excellents services and very helpful staff, Hotel well positioned for accessing a Marine Drive and other places, This is one our most comfortable stay at any Taj Property. We got a room on the 16th Floor with good view of the sea. The facilities in the room was top class."
"We've been fans of most Tajs around the world and this one is the root to all of it! Opened in 1903, the heritage / palace wing drags you back in time especially with the view of the gateway of India (when it's not crowded)  :)   We've stayed here earlier too but this time the staff has gone out of the way to make us feel so special and have taken all the steps to pamper us in their capacity! The check in process was as smooth as never before - even at Taj! Right from the Duty manager to the butler on duty; all of them have been doing their best to make us feel the best! Thanks Taj ..."
We stayed with family at Taj Palace hotel in the palace wing. The hotel is charming with old paintings and artifacts across the hotel. The famous taj hospitality takes a special meaning at the hotel with staff going out of their way to make you feel welcome. Breakfast place (Shamiana) staff were fantastic.   The two negatives are - there is no space to walk/arrivals has no outside space and security staff are heavy handed. We had Delhi Capitals team at the hotel and whilst players were willing to take pictures security staff were being unnecessarily rude. There is difference in following rules and following rules with common sense which seemed completely lacking!
"If you plan to stay in the original building where the suites are located, this hotel is simply the best in Mumbai, giving the four seasons a good run for it’s money. The staff are lovely, the breakfast and high tea hold a high standard and there is simply nothing to complain about"
Impeccable service with a variety of dining options. Right opposite the Gateway of India. Ask for a room with a view of the Gateway and Bay in the Palace wing.  Nice to retreat to the pool in hot weather. concierge desk is super helpful in terms of activities. 
"I visited Taj with my mother and brother. We have stayed at beautiful hotels around the world, but none compare to the service and attention to detail that this Hotel delivers.  The service is above first class. Every employee is 100% dedicate. We had Fresh fruit, water, and internet is included. Gorgeous fresh floral arrangements can be enjoyed throughout the public spaces. The breakfast is beyond wonderful with a great buffet and service. Our hostess Beauty at Shamiana was wonderful. Restaurant chefs have Michelin stars and the cuisine is divine. Staff is well trained and service is impeccable, gracious, and welcoming. Security is tight with every car inspected before being allowed entry as safety of guests is always important. After a day in the colourful, busy, loud, and"
Excellent stay. We enjoyed very much. Good location and proximity to Gate way of India. Had good and tasty breakfast. Excellent room service as well. We have visited here on many occasions and every time we felt happy smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes 
"This is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms are huge and very well furnished. The bed was extremely comfortable.  The actual building itself is magnificent and is even more beautiful on the inside. All the restaurants inside that we are at were very good although as with most hotels they are very pricey.  What however stood out for me was the service and attention to detail. From the people who welcome you with a necklace, to small gifts in the room, to beautiful decorations made with flowers there was always a new surprise. The staff are incredible and so friendly.  The hotel certainly isn’t cheap but if you can afford it stay here. "
"I have stayed in 5 Taj hotels throughout India including the fabulous Lake Palace In Udaipur.  Taj never fail to disappoint, their charming, exceptional service and attention to details never fails to impress.  We have never stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai before as we tend to try and get out of the big cities as soon as possible and the Taj Mahal Palace is a nightmare up to 2 hours journey from the airport at any time of the day, but we had 40 hours to kill before our connecting flight so we thought we would try.  What a waste of time and money.  We stayed in the Tower which was fine, the room was luxurious with fabulous bed linen and all the usual Taj comforts.  Reception and concierge staff were wonderful as usual. If you have never stayed at any other Taj hotel you"
"Though we have been to Mumbai many times on holiday, the last time we visited this hotel was just before the terrible terrorist attack. The interior refurbishment of the hotel is first class. However, the security set up outside the Palace is very amateurish is design and cheap in construction, whereas the security design outside the tower is very good. Let’s the hotel down baddly. Our room was very modern, though a bit crappy for a sea view club room. We would have expected better as we have travelled around the world and stayed in many club rooms. I am sorry I have to complain about the service which was mediocre. The staff were not attentive and we always had to go out of our way to get their attention and service. The hotel cannot live on its past reputation despite the"
A perfect end to our holiday. A demonstration of what customer service should be all about.  The location is ideal for reaching all the main locations and lovely walks along the waterfront.  Amazing view of Delhi Gate.
"we stayed taj before one week,hotel is completely like palace,if u wanna make your visit laxurious i will recommend this hotel,every thing was perfect from every side,i wanna say thanks specially mrs arti fb associate,who made our visit beautifull"
"The moment you enter into this historic hotel, you are transported to the old world of charm. My experience right from check in till the time I checked out was fantastic. I was lucky to be upgraded to 12 th floor room which was facing Gateway of India with great sea view. Service too was impeccable. Have decided to stay in this hotel during all my future trips to the city of Mumbai."
"Where to begin. Maybe the smell, it was heavenly. The halls are filled with essence of saffron and tuberose and sandal vetiver and lush with floral arrangements which are rotated daily.   We waited a little too long to check-in, there were some high maintenance guests ahead of us, but once the staff realized there was a back-up, they responded rapid-fire, and to apologize, upgraded our stay into the Palace which I am forever grateful! Everyone on the staff was outstanding, kind, helpful, and genuine. I think it was Mahtab who was kind of the queen of all of the staff at the palace (her name reminds me of a Nawab), who swooped in and helped us get checked-in and made sure we were set. She was a genuine hospitality professional with every step and you can tell her staff benefit"
"For the second time enjoying the Taj as a hotel, and several times visiting restaurants and shops that offer so good service and quality. For the first time but I enjoyed the Taj during a seminar, which allowed me to experience a complete new specialty of the offer panel. From the arrival to the departure, various things which are excellent: Excellent food and in great variety. Excellence in cleanliness and maintenance of the hotel interiors and surroundings and finally excellence in receiving the guests with a warm-hearted welcoming and extremely professional team. In each division of the hotel, be it in the restaurant, in the service at the  rooms on the floors, at the reception out- and inside. A real pleasure and must location to enjoy Mumbai fully."
"During a recent trip to Mumbai, my wife and I visited this truly beautiful and exquisite hotel. The aroma of freshly cut and arranged flowers was prevalent throughout.  Just for the experience we had drinks and cakes in the Sea Restaurant and savoured the sheer opulence of this amazing building situated on the waterfront next to the famous India Gate."
Our stay at the Taj was at the end of a wonderful 3 week tour of Northern India staying in some wonderful hotels. It was a perfect way to end our holiday. We had a sumptuous room overlooking the Gateway to India in the old part of the hotel. I loved the galleries leading to the rooms and the artwork displayed was amazing.  We had a delicious buffet breakfast in the Seaview restaurant and enjoyed a delicious Chinese meal from a choice of the various restaurants on the ground floor....we fancied a change after 3 weeks of curries!  We joined the guided tour of the hotel which is given everyday at 3.30. The delightful Meghanna gave the tour and it was really informative. In passing I mentioned it was my 60th Birthday holiday tour and when we returned to our room for our last night
We stayed in the Tower which was already pushing our budget to its limit but we found it to be well worth it.  A lovely hotel with brilliant staff who can't do enough for you.  The pool area is lovely (although the beds were often full) and the location of the hotel is perfect.  We ate in the hotel a couple of times and found it to be quite expensive but excellent quality.  I'd definitely recommend this hotel.
"This place is seriously good. From the beautiful rooms, with wonderful service, to delightful restaurants and bars. It is a luxury establishment but with a beautifully friendly culture which provides a feeling of welcome. This culture pervades everything they do. Of course, whilst the food is well priced, the alcohol is expensive - take care with your choices. Highly recommended!"
My biggest mistake on a splendid fifteen day trip across India was booking a luxury room at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai in the heritage wing. This is just a very personal comment as the majority of reviews for the Hotel are positive. We arrived late from Udaipur to be met with a rushed reception and taken directly to our room on the fourth floor.  The gesture on the surface appeared kind. We had a speed briefing on how things worked. Tired and weary it did not go in. The hotel is currently undergoing some refurbishment and we were reminded of thus at check in. Our room was spacious and despite ringing ahead and asking for a room with a window and view this did not happen. On double checking my reservation was for the basic luxury rooms which don’t have a garden or outside
"I can recommend the Taj Mahal Palace, it is probably on of the best hotels if not the best hotel in Mubai. The staff are extremely accommodating and helpful. The rooms are big, clean and comfortable and the pool area is fantastic! I would recommend to everyone, the perfect place to stay in Mubai is Taj Mahal Palace."
"We stayed in this hotel at the end of a months stay travelling in India, it was absolutely one of the highlights . There are not enough superlatives . The staff were all without exception wonderful . The room gorgeous . It certainly lived up to its reputation . A special thank you to the butler who fixed my shoe."
"What an experience. I really enjoyed my stay at the Taj. Well situated for sight seeing and shopping. Breakfast was really good. Staff was attentive and always courteous. A colleague became ill during our stay and they treated her exceptionally well, making sure she was resting and had all she needed."
"I can't address the overall Taj as a hotel or the several restaurants on the property. My only experience was meeting for drinks at the Harbour Bar. Inferior drinks, grossly (as in 4x) overpriced. I guess you are paying for ambience. (Service was indifferent as well). My rec, if you appreciate imaginative and tasty mixology, would be to hit the bar at the PaPaYa Thai place on the street behind the Taj."
customer service is very good...it's obvious its one of the best hotel in india...we dont have any problem from the hotel staf....hotel staf response is very quick and responsible...we dont have any peoblem...
This a fabulous hotel I like thank all the staff at Taj Mahal palace Mumbai to make stay comfortable and memorable specially I like to thank S Fernandez and Sayonika Das who went extra length to make my wife’s birthday a very special thank you all
"A must place to experience. From the first moment we stepped through the doors of this grand hotel until we left, we were treated with amazing friendliness and courtesy by the discreet and unassuming staff. The food from poolside snacks, breakfast and dinner in hotel restaurants was superb."
"We arrived at the Taj Palace having just left the Taj Lake in Udaipur.  Neither one of us expected it could possibly be as good.  Although we had a reservation for the Palace Wing, our driver dropped us at the Tower Wing and our hearts fell a bit.  It was so crowded and busy.  I began to have doubts but we were promptly checked in and soon in the serenity of the Palace Wing.  The service was superb and I have come to believe that the high level is consistent across the many properties (having just stayed at Umaid Bhawan, as well as the Taj Lake).  Our butler, Rahul, was always there to meet any request.  The concierge staff was on the spot to answer any question from where to go for British tailoring, to what restaurant to try for local Mumbai seafood.  They hit the mark every"
"This hotel is charming, beautiful building which us matched by its fantastic staff. The food is very good and the bar staff are excellent.  Loved this hotel and cannot wait to return. It compares with the other taj palaces in India. "
"We had an amazing 2 night stay in the Palace wing. The service was impeccable - right from our arrival through to checkout. The attention to small detail, the friendliness of the staff and the quality of restaurants and facilities make this a truly grand hotel. A must for any traveller to Mumbai."
This is a  large hotel and the reception area of the Tower is very busy. The bedrooms in the Tower are good but only showers. It is definitely worth getting the sea view. The service can be slow because of the volume of people but the food was good. I prefer hotel that are not so large but that is a personal preference.
"We stayed a few nights, travelled, then returned for a final stay before travelling back to the UK.  We had a Taj club room with city view.  Everything about this visit was superb, from the staff to the room to the eating experiences.  So, where do we start?  Check in, from the very start we were made to feel special.  Room?  Excellent with fine personal touches such as bookmarks left in our reading material.  Dining?  Wonderful.  Best buffet breakfast is in the Shamiana.  Large selection of cooked food along with cereal & fruit, from drinks to pastries and bread of all kinds. We were a little disappointed they had no lassi drinks so we asked our waiter....not a problem....mango lassi made to order.  One of the little extra's for staying in a club room is ""high tea"" and again"
"My wife and I stayed last week at the hotel as tourists from the U.S.. It was an amazing experience of service and luxury from the moment we arrived. The welcome drink flowers and the women painting Zi's hothead with a welcome dot  Believe it or not I had made the reservation in March not February. They made me feel very comfortable and smoothly gave us an ocean wiew 6th floor suite class room. The  amenities were too many to take advantage of; the butler, the welcome treats and drink, the complementary wine and tiered platter of appetizers in the Club style lounge on the first floor, the complimentary breakfast at one of three restaurants in the hotel, the delivered paper to the suite and the Limo from the Ship with the White starched uniform driver is very much a plus and was"
"every element is sumptuous, service impeccable, rooms amazing ( although mine did not have a view ) I wandered around as much as I could in a final 15 hours back in Mumbai from Hyderabad ( second Taj  Palace hotel this trip after Taj  Faluknama Palace ) and again felt I was timeless, in the busy city with UNESCO heritage status.. well this a gem of Victorian Revival meets contemporary. I sincerely hope to return for longer and just hang out here. The decor in each different floor, wing and so on is stunning. Adored the VSOP cheeky chocolate desert and the Dosas in the main dining area wher3e breakfast was also served... the Floating Pink staircase is a dream to behold"
"I recently stayed here with my family and I have to say this hotel is truly fantastic.  The hotel is luxurious, and the service is equally as good.  My two young sons loved the pool and the staff looked after us as if we were royalty.  The room was spacious and spotlessly clean. So many high-quality options for food and drink right within the hotel but the location is fantastic if you wish to eat out.  The gym is top notch too.   If you're staying in Mumbai, you have to stay at the Taj Palace.  Thanks to all the team for an unforgettable stay."
We were there with family and friends.. Very nice place with Royal touch.  Foods are awesome.  Very exceptional experience.  Feeled lucky and honored after went there.. All must visit once in their life there who visit Mumbai
"This is a very high quality hotel where everything has been thought of. There is great attention to detail. We were in the Tower part with an amazing view of the Gate of India and the boats bobbing about on the Arabian Sea. Windows closed, silence while you watch the sun rise or open the window and hear the hustle and bustle below. Food excellent from breakfast through to evening. We loved the Sea Lounge with live music every night and the Golden Dragon restaurant served the best Chinese food I have ever tasted."
"On our trip through Southindia we started and ended our journey at the Taj. After a long flight from Europe we sank in the beds as we would be at home. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable and everybody welcomed us warmly. Fine dining is assured in all different restaurants we tried. Tea and coffee served at any time in the sea lounge were just an other highlight. And the butler’s service on the floor brought my shoes to shine as never before, a service which is missing more and more in other hotels.  Many important places of the city are nearby in walking distance.  Should we come back  to Mumbai, we would choose the Taj without any doubt again. "
"Writing a review about this place is really not needed - it speaks for itself. This is possibly the most luxurious and historically interesting hotel that we have ever stayed in. The staff are always there when you need them, without being too conspicuous and seem to know what you want before you do! Absolutely first class attention to detail. Restaurants and wines expensive but you get what you pay for."
Everyone said you must have a drink in the Taj so we went and were quickly shown to a table in the lounge by a very helpful member of staff. We ordered G&T and it was very good but should have been at the price. This is a splendid hotel but unfortunately outside our price range other than having  a drink. Would like to stay here one day. The view was spectacular from the hotel of the Arabian Sea andof  the ferries going in and out.
"A fitting end to our 5 week holiday in India. We stayed in the old part of the hotel and really enjoyed our 3 nights (club room). The staff couldn’t have been more accommodating and always with a smile. Breakfast was excellent in the Sea Lounge. Restaurants within were reassuringly expensive but not as fab as the hotel (Golden Dragon). Snacks and drinks served in the Club Lounge was a pay extra. If I had to comment negatively, I would say that the snacks were distinctly poor especially the pre dinner ones with drinks up to 7:30 pm. Pool area superb. "
"Amazingly designed hotel. The architecture and the interiors are breathtakingly beautiful.  The staff a very friendly and are quick to provide assistance. Every tourist in Mumbai, has to visit this place. I had breakfast here and it was amazing. The views were superb too."
"I stayed there in 2/16 and back again in 2/19. It was just as grand, great location, surrounded by good restaurants. Above all, hotel staff makes it a great place to stay. I broke a bracelet and concierge had it fixed for me within hours! Grateful to staff!"
"This hotel is in the perfect location across from the Gateway of India, facing the sea, close to everything.  It is absolutely beautiful and well appointed with beautiful fresh flowers everywhere and an extraordinary staff...the bellmen, the check in, the women at the desk, the waiters, the spa staff, the pool help, the shop owners... Everyone was exceptionally helpful, kind and personable.   We had a little bit of a rocky start...We arrived at 1:30 AM to find out that our sea facing room in the tower had been taken.  To make up for this, we were upgraded to a much nicer room on the top floor of the palace.  Our room was absolutely gorgeous with  a large, luxurious bathroom and many little extras that would not have been included in our tower room.  We were completely spoiled by"
"This was my second stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. I last stayed there in April 2013. This time I stayed from January 31 to February 6th 2019. Upon arrival at 04h00 ( check in was at 15h00). I was treated royally. Coffee, water while I waited and I was given the option at a cost to check in earlier. The room with a balcony door that opens. Coming from a cold country this is always what I look for in a warm country.  The bed is so comfortable, great renovated rooms. Breakfast is wonderful. With so many choices including an outside eating area. When it was full we had the option of eating upstairs. I had afternoon tea, at the window of the Gateway to India and it was superbe I also did the heritage walk which was excellent, with stories, museum and the history of the hotel.  I"
We wanted to splash and have a memorable night at this place and that was what we got !! Can’t wax lyrical enough! Everything was superb!  A person I know suggested I ask for a room by the stairs (!) which initially I did not understand but now I Do as you get the best views out to Gateway of India. Don’t miss the breakfast!  Would definitely stay there again!! 
"After all Mumbai is a commercial centre and the iconic hotel in Mumbai is the Taj Mahal Palace overlooking the Gateway to India. Beautifully appointed with the bustle of many people coming and going, but without a real personal feel about it and that was evident on check-in when the staff go through the motions, as they must do hundreds of times a day. Rooms were well appointed, facilities were of a high standard, excellent choice at breakfast and a lovely swimming pool. We had a meal in the excellent Chinese restaurant, for a change and that proved a good choice. Mumbai, like all Indian cities is a wash with people and traffic, so make sure that one has left enough time to get to ones destination as it can take hours, literally!! The Taj is a great place to spend a couple of"
Great Atmosphere + Super Hotel with perfekt Services. Rooms and pool are great. Personal are very helpfull and friendly. Every day new flower arrangements at the Lobby. Breakfeast wonderful. Perfect to visit mumbai and indian history. We love it. We are so happy to stay there and we come back. 
"This is a lovely, well maintained and well run hotel deserved of its five star status.  Everything is absolutely perfect.  We had a helpful and friendly butler who couldn’t be more helpful.  The staff were all friendly and even housekeeping had a smile!  The rooms are clean and well maintained and the little touches every evening made us all smile. This is a happy hotel!  It is worth getting a room overlooking the sea as the Gateway of India is directly in front and the sunset over it is worth the extra cost. The gripe?  We were in executive rooms and were told that breakfast was served in the Sea Lounge. When we got there, on two consecutive occasions, we were told the restaurant was full and there was a wait of up to 30 minutes. We dutifully sat and waited.  There were half a"
I was at the hotel just for a quick visit and not as a guest. So I just could see the shopping and other public areas. The hotel is extremely beautiful and luxury is everywhere from the stone pavements to the wonderful lobby with all the beautiful counters. It definitely worths a quick visit for a tea.
"I wish this hotel wasn't so far away, because it would definitely become my 'go to' place.  From the moment we got out of the car at the door to the moment we got back in to leave for the airport we couldn't fault it. Our room was beautiful, overlooking the Gateway of India, and the service from start to finish was impeccable.  There were important guests at the hotel during our stay, and not once did I feel that we were being treated differently to them.  Please - if you have the chance to stay in this wonderful hotel, take it.   Puneet on reception went out of his way to make our stay as perfect as possible, and we are so grateful."
Wonderful stay for 2 night. Was upgraded to the palace wing of the hotel! Great service of pick up at the airport seamless check in and also got a very nice welcome drink! The room was very good cozy with a great bed to sleep. Also use the breakfast services at sea lounge and also at shamiana. The gym was also very good.   Special thanks to the room service butler Pritesh. 
"Staying at the Taj is as good as hotel travel gets. The rooms, public spaces and grounds are absolutely lovely. We stayed in the old wing, with all the elegance of the British era plus the warm and attentive hospitality of modern India. Lots of restaurants and food choices, including a fun high-tea which feels a bit like traveling back in time. The staff is incredibly warm and professional, and you get the sense that they really want your stay to be special in every way. Which it was. Another plus to staying at the Taj is the fantastic location in Colaba. Charming architecture, quiet streets, the cities best shops and eateries within walking distance. Not to mention the view of the iconic Gateway of India, right across the street from the hotel. Nothing but praise for this"
"I stayed in Mumbai for six nights in a 3 star hotel and booked one night at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel as a special treat to myself. It was even more luxurious than I expected and I will remember it for ever.  I was treated as a special guest and a treasured friend. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff, the Palace itself and the location were all outstanding. "
Lovely experience. Beautiful interiors - retained Raj era appeal. Lots of eating options with 5-6 in-house restaurants. Very courteous staff. Access to Sea Lounge is a big bonus. Different aroma in different sections of hotel is really refreshing.
Experiencing this fantastic classic hotel is a great experience with perfect service and great staff. Hotel also shows their history and has modern art gallery to visit. Perfection into all details and always worth to visit again.
"Stayed here for 9 nights. Check-in was little slow but apart from that all the services are excellent.Rooms are of generous sizes and with a modern touch. All the amenities are of very good quality which is expected from the Flagship Taj hotel. A new renovated gym and good sized swimming pool is for guests .Staff is super courteous . Breakfast buffet spread is very good. All the food items are very good in taste and if you need something extra ,it will be provided with a smile. A very comfortable stay and please do keep in mind that hotel doesn't allow any cooked food from outside ,so if you want to order from outside then it will be a waste. Hotel is surrounded by many famous cafes like Cafe mondegar and Loepold and Bade miyan . Overall a super luxury hotel and they justify the"
"I like decor of the hotel with lots of flowers arrangements, beautiful dressed stuff, beautiful building itself, although hotel situated on quite a busy road, that makes it difficult to have a quality rest. "
It was an real pleasure staying at the Taj Palace. Every single member of staff went above and beyond to make the stay as comfortable as possible. I’ve rarely felt so well taken care of. I managed to take advantage of the heritage tour which is a great option. I would have loved to do the sunset boat tour but my schedule didn’t permit.   The hotel and its staff present a truly fantastic version of what hospitality should be.   Hope to be able to visit soon again.
"Experience the Indian Royal Luxury at Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai. We stayed her at our Anniversary which they complementary upgraded us to even better room. Amazing Infrastructure, service food & view from the hotel."
"We stayed in December and came back in January. The hotel is home away from home!  All the team is AMAZING! Helpful! Smiling! Everybody makes you feel at home! Breakfast - everything you can think about is there. The selection is great and everything is fresh and tasty. We had breakfast  most of the tine at Shamiana , and a few time at the Sea Lounge. Its excellent in both places.  Golden Dragon  - Excellent food and service. Its really interesting to see the cooks preparing the dumplings dumpling! They use old type scales.  We had dinner in Shamiana a few times which was really good. Try the ice cream - The best!  Sea Lounge- Great service ! The afternoon tea and the happy hour is so nice!  Pool- Just beautiful! The room is very comfortable and clean! The shower...the best !"
"I dont usually review places I've stayed, but this requires a review... Since I booked the Taj in Dec 2018, the team at Taj have made error after error after error. Here are some of them: Extremely poor internal communication and high staff turnover - lead to some monumental cock ups that that will never be put right - essentially, they ruined my proposal to my now Fiancee  Booked the palace, got the tower... when asked about this, they claim to have 'upgraded' us into a cheaper room. Cleanliness is appalling, theres rubble on the bathroom floor... i wouldn't expect this from Tra velodge, let alone one of the most prestigious brands in the world.  All in all 2 out of 5 would be generous. Do yourselves a favour, save the money and book somewhere that will care."
"This was our second stay at the Taj Mahal Palace, this time in the Tower, and once again we were not disappointed. Beautifully appointed bedrooms, personable and engaging staff and a delicious breakfast. BBQ by the pool is not to be missed, nor is a dip in the pool! We will definitely be staying here again when we’re next in Mumbai. "
"The Taj experience is one I have always wanted to have. And on our first ( but not only) visit it surpassed expectations. The location in Apollo Bunder is excellent, the seaview room we had was magnificent and the choice of restaurants was tremendous. To have breakfast in the Sea Lounge was something I will not forget ever. It is an oasys of calm and tranquility in Mumbai's madness and the service levels are unsurpassed. We will be back someday ...."
We had such a lovely time at this hotel.  It was very moving seeing the memorial from the terrible terrorist attack.  Staff are amazing.  Hotel is fantastic.  Great location and views over the amazing city of Mumbai.
"endering opulence, convenience and a variety of scrumptious cuisines.Awesome place to stay in..an experience of lifetime. Very well behaved staffs and great amenities in the room. Food in the restaurant is simply superbly delicious. A must place to visit. The view of sea outside hotel is breathtaking. Come fall in love with 'The Taj Mahal Palace.'"
From greeting at the entrance our 4 days were the best we have ever experienced. This gem is at the top of travel experiences.  The hotel is magnificent.  It has art work throughout.   We stayed in the historic wing and it is like brand new.  Large room with all the amenities you could ask for.   The service is unbelievable. Ask and you will receive. Price was very fair and I only wish the American 5 stars could be as nice.  It will be hard to travel again as I don’t think I can match this experience
"We also stayed here in 2007 and fell in love. After the horrific terror attack, we wondered what changes we would see. All I can say is that the hotel is more majestic than before! We stayed in the Palace(rather than the towers which is newer and more contemporary)and would go back in a heartbeat!. Our check in was done  swiftly and in our room By the  assistant manager himself( Mohinder Bhatia) whose professional manager personified Tajness! This is someone who loves where he works and is not afraid to share that!! We were fortunate to get a suite facing the Arabian Sea and The iconic Gateway to India. There was a small balcony with 2 chairs and a table and a screen covering the front part to keep the birds out. We saw beautiful sunrises, the quiet of the early morning to the"
Well yes the overall experience was awesome. No doubt it is the most preferred and awesomw hotel in Mumbai. Location is beautifull and service is great. Sea view in the evening is mesmarizing and fill your heart with joy and happiness. Couples shud visit the place once for a romantic evening atleast I liked it
"The old wing envelopes you in a cocoon of warmth and elegance.  Walk the corridors, slowly, and take in the amazing art collection. And yes, atleast once during your stay, skip the elevator and use the magnificent staircase! "
Do not hesitate! This hotel has an amazing ambiance and lovely staff.  If you are lucky you will get to meet Nima who was absolutly amazing in helping me out with my dry cleaning or you get to meet Salwyn from the Harbour bar. His lifestory is insperational.  This hotel is beyond anyones expectations
"This is not the Taj Tower, which is a modern hotel next door.  You can see it in the picture.  This is the Palace, definitely the grand colonial place that will remind you all the time what luxury you're enjoying.  Large rooms with ceiling fans (and A/C of course).  Great food in the Indian resto and for breakfast poolside.  A wonderful fragrance all through the public spaces downstairs.  And an imposing central staircase up to the 5th floor.  So if you're feeling guilty about all the great curry you've eaten, return to your room via the stairs."
"We had a beautiful sea view Heritage Wing room which was lovely and of a high standard.  Could not fault the service and standards.  The shower was the best I think I have ever experienced in all the hotels I have visited worldwide!    Only small gripe was the swimming pool – there are very few loungers (30 perhaps) and for a 500 room hotel it is very poor and ends up with being unable to find somewhere to sit – they really need to do something about this as there is ample grassy areas adjacent to the pool which could easily accommodate more loungers.  The pool staff were helpful but there really can’t do anything if all the loungers are taken.  We mentioned when we checked out and they are aware of the issue, the hotel was not designed with a pool back in 1903 so space is"
"We have stayed at the Taj Mumbai many many times over the last 40 years. We love it and have always found it an exceptional hotel, it is a complete treat. This time it was rather different. We stayed for 4 nights from the 11th February. I got sick on the 2nd day and was in bed for a day and a half, it was as a result of something I ate at the pool restaurant! After a lot of complaints we were upgraded to a suite, which was very nice but I lost two valuable days in Mumbai. I found the hotel packed with visitors more so that usual, as it is a tourist destination, so much so it was difficult getting down the corridors in the late afternoon. I also found the service not to be up to the usual standard. The sea lounge was exceptional as always."
"THe  Taj Mahal Palace was a dream and most of it was fulfilled by its location, its rooms - or suites in our case  -  and the cleanliness and fabulous bed linen.  However, we were greatly disappointed wtih the slow and inefficient service at  breakfast."
"We were upgraded from the Taj Tower to the main hotel which was a great bonus.  The delights of this hotel are well known and I will not dwell on them.  I will just say that the staff make the hotel.  Everyone we met had a smile on their face and gave a friendly greeting.  It just seemed to come naturally to them.  If we have to single out individuals two come to mind, the Director of Rooms - orientation, Ms Mahtaab P. Sidhwa; and our breakfast waiter, Percy - he was great.  Special thanks to them for memorable service."
"Having stayed 2 nights at ""the Tower"" (separate review) we moved across to our Club Room in the Palace for a special occasion (Club rooms and above give you free priveleges such as one airport transfer, afternoon tea, some cocktails, and after dinner cognac). As our room wasn't ready we were upgraded to a suite (normally 3x the price). What can I say? It made an already exceptional experience in to a fabulous one. The Taj Mumbai was the first hotel of it's kind in India, and is probably still the best."
"Our stay was for business and pleasure.   The service is the best,  world wide with staff anticipating our every need. We have stayed a number of times and service is catered to each guest's needs.  The Shouk restaurant is delicious with phenomenal service.  Yoga and Breakfast by the pool is the best way to start the day and delicious and healthy.  A must do is to chill by the pool.  The lobby is the place to people watch.  The spa....newly built....IS AMAZING.  Just fantastic.  Go early and get in the vibe.  Overall a phenomenal stay, team and facilities. "
"Over any weekend the hotel is besieged by backpackers clutching to their water bottles, sight seers and photo opportunists.  The local secret with taxi drivers is to just pop in the ground floor and use the public toilet there.  Good advice, but not for the residents paying the bill.  Be aware the hotel will charge you for the days you booked, not just for the days you stayed.  It is an unethical, and in Europe quite illegal, racket, to make as much money as possible.  Guests only learn of this rule when they paid a deposit and receive a booking form, and there it is cleverly hidden further down the page.  A disgusting policy!"
"I have taken guests to enjoy the high tea at the Taj several times before and never have these experiences disappointed us in any way. Today however, I was shocked and appalled by the total nonchalance and lack of service that the waiters showed. Everything we finally got served we had to call out for. Nobody seemed to wait at our table as they had been doing the other times.   The warm food on the buffet had more than a third of the serving plates empty and there weren’t many choices of food.   The tea was lovely and so was the ambiance, but today we felt like we did not get our monies worth. The building itself is a piece of art, so I’d recommend a visit there. But avoid the high tea. Unless you’re ready to pay up for mediocre food and service. "
"Our family, 2 adults and three kids aged 6,3 and 0 loved this hotel.  From check in to check out it was sublime.  Beautiful property, great location, luxurious room, delicious food and world class service."
Enjoy the mind boggling view of Arebian sea.A devine feeling under the great Tata group of hotels.A perfect place as you could expect.A dining in any Taj restaurants is way over the top.Excellent place to visit.
Our entire family enjoyed a 3 night stay in the Heritage Wing of this beautiful hotel. The location is perfect with a beautiful view of the water and Gate. The rooms are very nice and the breakfast buffet was always delicious. Great neighborhood restaurants and sights are within easy walking distance.  Ankita Bhatt was so helpful and personable at check in and check out- she is darling. Ganesh Dhanawade was very attentive to our family and with all of our belongings when we had to wait for a very late flight home. Ransom A. D'sa at the Travel Desk was also very helpful. Thank you!
"Our second stay at the Taj – the first being just before the terrorist attack 10 years ago.  There are many reasons for staying in an hotel, from necessity during a short visit, to a never to be forgotten lifetime trip where the experience outweighs necessity.  This hotel rates top of the list in the second category. From collection from the airport, arrival at the hotel, check-in (we were in a Taj Club Room in the Palace wing), and everything following, it is the experience and the history that remains in the memory.  Unlike some other guests who report here less than satisfactory experiences with the hotel, our stay was about as perfect as you could expect, a building steeped in Indian history – good & bad, superb fixtures and furnishings both in the public areas and rooms,"
"Staying here is inconvenient and not a luxury feel.  It is a great, great building but administratively it is living in the past.  Check in - they run you around / Check out is an ordeal (its easier to check out at any other hotel I have ever stayed in), WiFi is extremely hard to work, room housekeeping is inconsistent, and room amenities have been cut (from past stays).    Sad to see it fading.    AFTER I checked out they charged my credit card for a meal which was not mine - never had that happen before in a lifetime of travel!"
We stayed there with our earlier booking . When we enter to that hotel . Nothing can be ignored. From receiving guest  to last day departure. Room has been upgraded to club room with garden view and butler services. We stayed in heritage side. They are hospitable and organized in all aspects. When you are staying there never forget to take heritage tour in hotel .  It was our leisure trip ... from breakfast to dining we did not forget to taste everything. We walked through the surroundings... great experience.  Restaurants and bar ... poolside all are memorable .
This was a hotel experience unlike any other. We only stayed for one night and in one of the standard rooms in the newer part of the hotel but the staff treated us like we were VIPs - I've never experienced such customer service! Upon arrival the front desk asked us if we were there for a special occasion and we said it was our parent's anniversary. Without thinking anything of it we joined the complementary history tour of the hotel and were told to stick around at the end to see some of the special rooms. We got to see 2 of the diplomatic suites and upon entering the third the staff had set up a small celebration for our parents including cake and balloons - it was incredibly thoughtful and it completely made the trip.
The Taj Palace. The name itself says a lot  You get the Royal experience right from the time you check in to the rooms. I had 2 rooms 543 Suit & 538 luexry room. The suit is huge & luxurious with Morden mixer. Luexry room was quit big and luxurious too. Business Club lounge access is 24  hours which is rare interior of lounge was fantastic and rich they serve expensive cognac after 9:30 PM. One of my favourite place in Taj Mahal palace is pool side Restarunt which is only for hotel residence. Must visit hotel in India
We stayed in the classic wing and it’s amazing art collection. Close to the Star of India which was built for a English kings visit. The flowers were everywhere. The food was sublime with the best Indian food we had in India and Chinese food as good as one can get in Beijing.  A classic hotel especially the original building.
"Right from the 90's, I always had a dream to stay here. Then in Sept. 2015 we could. Wonderful and memorable stay it was. The experience was exquisite. My wife being an Inner circle member got a very good offer."
"Taj Hotel is one of the most famous hotels in India which is a location near the gateway of India and it's a great and popular location of Mumbai. With more than 115 years of its grandeur, it has been created many milestones of its services. Just located on the Arabian seaside! Come and experience the hospitality of this hotel once!"
"We found the rooms a bit tired and the staff professional but disinterested. Restaurants the same. We stayed because it is a Mumbai institution, but it’s better to go for a visit (combine with the Gateway of India) and stay somewhere better. Transport-wise it’s not efficient for the city as it’s at at the base of the Colaba peninsula, so you add travelling time for journeys to and from the hotel."
"Excellent rooms, good service , well behaved staff, good location. There is nothing which go against this hotel. They are excellent in each department of hospitality. I love to stay again and again in this hotel particularly Taj palace."
"I can't express my feelings by words as it was superb superb services provided by your team. Everything was great,  Starting from the welcoming  to the departure. God Bless you all. Trust me, in every visit i will certainly stay in Taj.  I have visited more than 30 countries and stayed in deluxe hotels however, service provided by Taj is exceptional !!  no way to compare with others. At the end, i sincere thanks to MS. Rakhi Tanmay who helped me for booking/reservation and also she notify me by phone (very professional service !! ) and one more friend Ganesh Jadhav (house keeping staff) he is another superb guy. The way he was taking care of me as a family member !! all the best both of you and hope to see  you soon in next trip. I recommend every single traveler to visit Taj"
"We recently spent a few days in Mumbai and stayed at the Taj Palace.  Amazing experience and a beautiful hotel.  The art, people and food were all great.  We had a room attendant who couldn't do enough to make our stay comfortable, including a rose petal warm foot bath. The food was very good and the service terrific. From check-in to check out and everything in between it was a great experience.  The art and treasured items that decorate the hotel were the equivalent of visiting a museum.  Entire staff were great including our driver who took us to the airport!  Had an issue at checkout that was not the hotel's fault but they worked through it graciously. The night manager intervened and even walked us to our car after helping to resolve a problem which was not of their"
We stayed at the Taj Mumbai in December 2018 for a wedding. The ambiance of the hotel is superb to say the least. The service and the love that the staff shower upon you is amazing. We loved the gesture when the front desk team handed over the replica of the old minted coin when the hotel was originally built during our farewell at the time of checkout. The breakfast was good- the hotel overall has amazing eating options.  The rooms are nice- however the housekeeping wasn’t the best. We felt the room hadn’t been thoroughly cleaned before or during our stay.  I hope they can better that division of this prestigious hotel.  The size of the rooms is average.  Overall a pleasant stay.
"Taj is always an experience in itself and this time being Taj Mahal Palace, it was really mesmerising. It is really difficult to explain the experience in words, as one need to feel it.   From room decor, to ambience, to feel the royal ness, to experience the Taj service, it is amazing.   The room is just perfect to relax after a busy schedule. The washroom is the best. Being Taj, the amenities are outstanding.   Food, quality and quantity both match Taj standard.   Morning buffet spread is great.   "
"We stayed at Taj Mahal tower hotel for 1 night for our 25th wedding anniversary celebration. The Taj Team did not leave any stone un-turned to make our stay memorable and eventful. We were offered room on the 8th floor with view of Gateway of India. They decorated our room for our 25th anniversary, showered us with a beautiful flower bouquet and delicious cake.  During our stay we had high tea at the famous ""Sea Lounge"" Restaurant, which again was a marvelous culinary experience. We also had buffet breakfast at Shamiana, which has all the breakfast food you can think from across the globe.  Taj Mahal hotel has lots of history,  they offer Hotel tour in the afternoon which is a must. In the evening they have a ritual to pay the obeisance to the setting Sun, and early in the"
"We love this hotel and yes it’s got it issues (older rooms can smell a bit damp) but the hotel is amazing.   The staff offer world class service and the restaurants are very good.  We loved the swimming pool, a proper old deep pool - brilliant. "
We had a wonderful stay ! Right from the time we entered the entire staff was very welcoming and hospitable ! The facilities the food & service at both the restaurants were par excellence . The Souk - authentic Lebanese & Golden Dragon the Chinese fine dine were excellent ! 
"We visited the Taj Mahal Palace for Afternoon Tea.  The hotel itself is well worth a visit, even just to “look”.   As your eyes turn upwards, the floors seem to stretch all the way to heaven.  There is an imposing bust of Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata (founder of the Tata Group) who bought the Taj Mahal Palace in 1903.  There is also a wall with photos and press cuttings dedicated to the accomplishments of past and present owners and heads of the Tata group as well as photos of famous people who have stayed at the Taj.   The dining room was full for afternoon tea.  Tea or coffee was served at the table (extra charge for juices) and later scones, jam and cream (not clotted cream) but the remainder of the afternoon tea was  “serve yourself” from the extensive buffet.   The selection"
"Great hotel.....nostalgic feeling...excellent food and crowd.....their weekend buffet in the coffee shop is to the for....and also if you are a member of raj inner circle, great discounts on food and stay.....and offcourse Amazing sea view."
It is very close to the airport.  So it was convenient when we arrived at 1 AM.  We only stayed one night when we arrived.  It is a bit noisy as it is next to the new subway tunnel being constructed.  Breakfast buffet was good as was the service.
"We stayed for three nights after a busy tour schedule in Kerala and Goa....and the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel did not disappoint. Upgraded on arrival as it was our wedding anniversary, the staff could not have been more welcoming. Tremendous room, wonderful service and an extraordinary new spa completed our enjoyment of the stay. "
"I was mislead by advertisement and PR that Taj hotel is the best in Mumbai. It is simply not true. It’s standards are way-way below. You can judge it by yourself: not clean windows, dirty doors, poor renovation (fractures and bumps all over the place), grey towels (that should be white instead of course), holes on the grey curtains that severely need to be ironed (I have lived in room number 540 and I was unpleasently surprised as it is not how room for more than $450 suppose to look. It’s just wrong!), line with more than 20 person who are “having fun” on staircase waiting to be seated for breakfast. And cherry on the top - absolutely unprofessional behavior of manager Varun Kaundal. He was talking to my PA, took her bank details but still did not manage to deal (despite he"
"We came to this hotel straight from the stunning Lake Palace in Udaipur so our impressions of the Taj Mahal Palace were undoubtedly influenced by that  That said and whilst undeniably  impressive , (we stayed in a grande luxury  sea view room with a view of the gateway to India) we found the hotel to be a little on the soulless side  with lots of businessmen and business going on around us making the overall feel very corporate  We were also surprised to find items we had purchased at the Lake Palace such as wines even more expensive at the Taj Mahal presumably because expense accounts can absorb the high costs That said service was as expected impeccable and our room was lovely although I do think the toiletries should be more luxurious in quality for the price paid especially"
"On my recent birthday my husband and I stayed in that beautiful Palace Hotel and enjoyed every moment of our stay. Not only that I had 2 birthday cakes and lots of flowers in my room, we also felt greeted and treated like friends and of course had a wonderful room in the Palace wing. If we ever again come to Mumbai, of course we'll stay again in Taj Mahal Palace."
"We were really looking forward to staying at the Taj , 28-30th January after 10 days of very intensive tiger safaris.We were collected at the airport as part of the Club room deal by a really knowledgeable driver, so this was an excellent start. However on our first night we had considerable noise from the room next door and it took an hour before the Duty Manager and other staff managed to do something about it. The lack of feedback on  was very disappointing , inspite of being told we would be called back, we had to keep calling to ask what was happening. One response that security staff could not hear anything outside the rooms was ridiculous as I had made it clear the noise was coming from the room next door's television that was on the wall of the room next door right next"
"Wonderful on arrival, I can still smell the beautiful perfume of the stunning flowers  in the lobby now! We stayed for 3 nights, we had a wonderful view from the 14th floor in the tower of the Gateway to India. We enjoyed a High Tea in the Sea Lounge. Yes drinks were expensive but staying here was the highlight of our stay in Mumbai! Highly recommended!"
I wasn’t fortunate enough to have stayed at this magnificent hotel but I did admire it from four sides as I walked around it. It’s huge and a magnificent structure. It would be hard to stay there as it’s constantly surrounded by people and honking taxis. To be admired. 
We had a great two night stay at this hotel which fully deserves its five star rating.  The room was beautiful and spacious with excellent temperature controls and bathroom facilities.  Service is impeccable and there are several restaurant options which were very good.  It is fairly pricey but reasonable for the high quality which is offered.
"From the grandeur of the rooms to the quality of service where you are genuinely looked after in a way you wouldn’t have believed possible , this hotel is a phenomenon. The pool is a wonderful oasis in central Mumbai and you can eat breakfast (the widest selection of edibles ever seen) while watching the sun rise over the Gateway of India"
"Had a room on 6th floor over looking the Gate way to India on India National day, so the area was exceptionally busy with people and security. The room was comfortable. It was interesting to visit the older building and imagine the history of the place. All the restaurants were busy due to the national holiday. So had a barbecue supper by the pool. Note the drinks are about twice the price , compared to other hotels."
"The Taj is a most welcome 'bubble' of safety, quietness, cleanliness and comfort for Occidentals in India. We landed there after a week in Kerala, very nice and picturesque but somewhat stressful... for your eyes, for your ears, for your stomach... As soon as you walk into the Taj you feel safe and can lower your ""guard"" about the environment. The decor is fabulous and I encourage you to take the time to look at the paintings on the walls and a lot of other details that make it a beautiful place. Restaurants, although sometimes quite pricy (eg. the japanese place... excellent but sushi are outrageously priced)... are all very good, wine lists are great and service is perfect."
We spent 6 nights in a Luxury Grand Sea View room.  Our room was lovely and maintained beyond our expectations by our lovely room attendant Anil.  We loved every second of our stay.  The breakfast was plentiful each morning in Shamiana. We will return to the Taj Mahal Palace in the future.  It's truly a destination of its own.  Thank you to all the staff for making our stay magical.
"We had high tea at the hotel.  We paid approx. 2,300 Rupees each.  Having high tea here was on our `bucket list', and we were not disappointed.  You can not book, but we arrived about half an hour early and obtained a window seat.  High sea is between 3:30 - 6:30 pm. The ambience was fantastic, as was the food.  The desserts were amazing - do not leave them to last.  The staff were very professional and one of the chefs came to our table to ask about the quality of our experience, etc.  He was very courteous and was great to talk to. This was indeed one of the highlights of our trip to India.  Highly recommended as an experience."
"Right from stepping out of the taxi to leaving, every small details was through about with regards to our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace.  The room, the service and the Staff, All of very high quality and calibre made our stay very memorable!!!  Really enjoy the little welcome ritual of Taj and also the nice little souviner scarf and embossed card holder."
"We booked the Taj club suite in the palace wing for our anniversary. The package came with compliments galore, which made our stay very very comfortable. The sheer luxury of staying in a 115 year old hotel was transcendent. Each wall holding so much history- it was consuming. The food at each different restaurant was absolutely delicious. Even the in-room dining was such a great experience as samrat (the designated butler) set up a lovely dining table furnished with flowers and the works in our room.  I recommend taking the heritage walk to truly understand the depth of this grand hospitality legacy. "
"We went there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and Taj made it really memorable. From the arrival to departure, they made it sure we keep smiling. The main features to see are the iconic Dome and Floating Staircase. Plus, do not miss the heritage walk at 3:30 pm everyday. They made it sure that our little infant enjoys her stay by pampering her with soft toys and games to keep her busy... All in all an awesome stay at one of the first Luxurious hotel of our Country..."
"In all our travels we have never come across such a well run hotel. The staff are brilliant. The hotel oozes class, sophistication, quality, romance and history, being over 100 years old. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a 5 plus star experience. Well done Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai. "
"Staying at the Taj was a dream.Had booked the tower with the city view with a request for the gateway view which is chargeable which Booking apps do not show.Upgraded to taj palace but room location wasn’t great.The room, service, staff was brilliant.Breakfast buffet was a disappointment as there is waiting & the buffet spread is just like any hotel or maybe less , also staff here not very welcoming."
"We did a 21 day family trip to India from Sydney and stayed at many hotels but this one was truly a unique experience.  You feel special the moment you go through the check-in process. And it only gets better after that.   The rooms are beautifully furnished, the hotel interior is palatial, the staff are brilliant, the breakfast spread amazing and the location is central. It's expensive but if you can afford it even for a short stay then you won't regret it.  Note, the hotel has a strict policy of no outside food or drink.  "
"A Taj Mahal Palace stay is an incomparable introduction to India .. luxury, superb service and attention to detail put this place in a category of its own. I highly recommend this as a first stop in India."
"Spent two nights here before an Indian Wedding at Alibaug.  Staff most helpful and courteous.  It was a busy time just after New Year, resulting in a little wait for breakfast, but handled professionally. My room was in the Tower part of the hotel and consequently quite contemporary.  Would love to have seen a room in the original main building. Pool area  divine.  Shame that I did not have enough time to savour it."
Made to feel special from the moment we pulled up in the taxi.Reception process very efficient. Wonderful choice of restaurants. Lovely pool. Not to mention the beautiful rooms.A place to come back too.
Awesome food and rooms were there. Their staff takes care of every single thing. I really enjoyed there. I want to go again there. Everything was best in the rooms. This is the best place where I took the time to live.
Every wish was catered for. The room was comfortable and well furnished. Service was excellent.The pool area is comfortable and well serviced- choose to sit facing the hotel not the surrounding buildings.
"We didn't stay in the hotel. But the Taj Mahal Palace is an amazing building by itself, one of the icons of Mumbai. It has a history behind (from the way it was build to the attacks that suffered). It's located right in front of the Gateway of India and it's worth a visit from the outside to admire the main building."
"Colonial excellence, lucky we were put in the Palace wing. Room was gorgeous, Harbour Bar great if pricey. Breakfast was good, staff excellent. If I had one downside it would be the tour, if the hotel has a history tell it no mind how black it may be."
"Room was excellent, breakfast superb and hospitality was unprecedented .We had a partial sea view, and watched the Eagles and pigeons play cat and mouse at sunset.Everyone should do this once in their life."
This is the most beautiful and most caring hotel in the world! Made me feel like a real princess! The Sea Lounge is my favorite restaurant and always has been! I love looking at the Gateway of India! I was SO pampered!
"Staying in room 539, very nice as are the staff at various points around the hotel. We came here after six awful nights at the Taj Village in Goa which put quite simply, is a dump. We found Booking. to be better value for money than booking direct with the Taj Palace, which is strange. Bookings. also offered a half board option which we opted for and are sorry we did. The menu offers are limited using half board so after a limited dinner in the Chinese, my wife went to reception to request if we could use the half board credit at the Chambers and pay the difference the following night and the answer was yes. So after breakfast she went to reception to enquire about booking and was told that’s it’s not allowed for half board customers to use the Chambers and the Duty Manager"
"Checked in on Jan 22 and checked out on Jan 24. As i checked in ,my room was upgraded from Taj Mahal Palace Tower to Taj Mahal Palace which was a pleasant surprise ! Staying in the Heritage Taj is a unique experience altogetherr.....Seperate Lounge with 24*7 tea/coffee served, exclusive poolside +  Gateway of India view side room was just amazing ! Expensive if you are not on a Business trip but worth it...!"
Loudest hotel I have ever stayed in - sleep impossible except  between 2am and 6am only. Why on earth would you put people in rooms in stair hall that echoes and amplifies the nightly party that happens at the base of the stair? Terrible - all the historic charm in the world cannot make up for the unholy racket that prevents any rest. Not recommended if you plan on actually sleeping.
"We Had lunch in the Indian restaurant Masala Kraft, service was slow but food was excellent, lovely setting next to the swimming pool. Unfortunately wifi is not available unless you are staying the hotel which is disappointing."
"We are frequent travellers and whenever we are in India we always try to factor in a few days in Mumbai to stay at Taj Mahal Palace, what used to be our favourite hotel in the world. This was our sixth stay in a Palace Club room but on this occasion the overall experience didn't quite come up to the standards we have enjoyed in the past.      Our room on 6th floor was beautiful and our bedding preference had been noted - top marks to Housekeeping!  There was some hotel maintenance taking place so much  hammering during the day which didn't help jetlag naps.  We were also surprised to be disturbed by loud music from a function on 1st floor until 3am.    Breakfast was insanely busy on some days and we tried 3 different venues in the hotel before finding an available table.  This"
"My favorite hotel in India, beautiful rooms and baths, excellent dining, outstanding and attentive staff service with personal check in and knowledgable concierge. Excellent, super fancy shopping within the hotel. Ask to stay in the old wing with the beautiful, old halls and stairways so beautifully maintained. ."

"We only had time to have lunch at this hotel as not in Mubai for very long. The hotel is beautiful , no doubt about it and the lunch we had was delicious...I didnt think too much about the staff, but can only comment on a brief stay and perhaps with guests staying at the hotel you would get a different view. I would say that to encourage another possible visit though, staff may actually be attentive to all guests ? I would have to read the reviews on peoples opinions staying at the hotel to decide on a further visit..For our needs the time, we were pleased to have visited for lunch."
"We had a great room in the original palace building, not the tower. We had a butler on our floor who showed us around the Raj suite on our floor, if you can stretch that “little extra” it is majestic. The building inside has to be seen to even begin to appreciate its glory. It is stunning. We stayed 4 nights and the service was impeccable throughout our stay. Variety of restaurants with excellent service, especially the European/Lebanese restaurant on the top floor of the Tower."
As beautiful as the real Taj. Ratan Tata Sir should be complicated for the compliments this graceful hotel receives. As you enter you feel the richness of royalty the courteous staff with the undying smile to uplift your mood. folded_hands
Just back from an India trip and spent the last two nights at Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai. It has been 25 years since my last visit and things have definitely changed. Still great service etc although I did find the hotel a lot more frantic than I remember it. Perhaps the adjoining Taj tower is the reason. 25 years ago the Palace was a real haven of peace for the recreational traveller in a bustling city - it still retains a dignity but I suppose changing times has meant the hotel has had to adopt much more of a business style focus. Enjoyed my short stay nevertheless.
"The superb service we enjoyed at the hotel began with the concierge before we arrived. All our questions were answered promptly and knowledgeably. In addition I specifically requested a quiet room and was given one that was virtually silent (not easy in Mumbai). The room itself - on the Club floor- was perfect as was the service thoughout the hotel. A special thanks to security who, when I lost a parcel rang, round some shops to try and trace it and then rang me in England.  We ate at two excellent restaurants. The Table, a three minute walk from the Taj and the Khyber an excellent Indian restaurant a 10 minute taxi ride (or a 20 minute walk) away.   We would not consider staying anywhere else in Mumbai."
"An excellent, warm and vibrant restaurant to enjoy amazing Indian delicacies. A must visit place for Muglai food, Kebabs and Curries. Staff in the hotel is extremely friendly and courteous, located right at the Iconic Gateway of India this is a must visit hotel on your trip to Mumbai."
"Taj is really Taj.The Royal ambience, highly talented and polite staff, variety of restaurants.Taj have two wings.Newer one is multi storied building facing Gateway of India,and older one is connected with new wing also facing sea and historical monument."
Beautiful hotel - wonderful Christmas atmosphere.  Lovely service from all staff who we found most obliging and helpful.  Lovely outdoor area with swimming pool.  Make this hotel your first choice for glamour - we will return.
"I visited this hotel 6 time before this and this was my 7th visit. As no need to tell about the beauty and tradition of this hotel. I travel for business I mostly stay with Taj and like tell start from the door of the hotel till the check-out the hotel staff paly a most important role. All the things are well maintained and well polish. This time I like to take about the food which I ordered in the room. In afternoon around 15:hrs I ordered a traditional Indian Dum biryani,and got the biryani I'm my room this was my first experience for trying this type of food.  And I can't wait to tell u that he just open the biryani and served me and the first spoon I put in my mouth and that was a nicez than my room service boy told me to have with out using spoon and I was confused so"
Taj Mahal hotel is very good and beautiful. The service in this hotel is mindblowing. Rooms are a comfort to pocket and availability is so good. Nice to stay in this hotel. Peaceful experience. You know one this I.e the food are expensive.
"Pool is awesome.  Staff are great. Stayed in the Tower for 5 nights - but they put us on top floor right underneath the ballroom - where a very very loud party screamed on until 2am - followed by a tear down and chair thumping cleanup until 4am.  Complained before midnight to reception, they would not do anything to address the noise because of course they were making more money from the party than us.  Entire floor of rooms was very upset and complaining.  So, they moved us to a tower suite to compensate for duration or our stay and did comp us the room for the evening in question. This was an acceptable and kind gesture and we were happy with that.  Then we made the huge mistake of booking the New Year’s Eve dinner and party at the restaurant - at a cost of the t5,000 ruppees"
"I have stayed in luxury hotels around the globe from four seasons , mandarin, oberio and lots more, with out doubt this is perfection, it should be not only number 1 in Mumbai but also the world,  Mr Singh the hotel director and his team work so hard to make sure every single detail is right for all guests , the dining options, the rooms , facility's are such a high standard you will not want to leave the hotel, we are here for 3 nights and still here and I can not wait to wake up to take in more of this luxury , so relaxing in every way , please feel free to ask me any questions on why I believe this is the best hotel in the world.  "
The service was excellent (i's Taj! Duh!) . The food was great and the portion was surprisingly large at Shamiana Cafe. The ambiance was amazing! I would recommend this place to anyone who wishes to experience luxury.
"Quite incomparable, in terms of location and service. A classic hotel beautifully maintained with splendid service levels.  We loved our breakfast in the outdoor area of the restaurant serving breakfast, our dinner with Mumbai friends in the Indian restaurant quite superb.  Our thanks to concierge and travel desks, so helpful.  Whilst not inexpensive we simply could not imagine staying elsewhere.  The Palace Wing has wonderful ambience. Taj Hotels are to be congratulated, we look forward to further stays with them as we continue our journey."
Very good location. Good facility. Pleasant and responsive staff. Delicious food. High level service. We were welcomed and treated in very nice manner. the view from the room was very beautiful. The contingent of visitors is elite.  
"The hotel was recommended to us as a place to visit and we were not disappointed, the garden area is beautiful and the hotel and shops very impressive. We had dinner in the restaurant and sampled typical indian street food without the risk factor. The food was amazing and highly recommended, although the waiter did say he had asked them to reduce the spice on one of the dishes. Service was good and the price was reasonable although you are stung with two extra taxes on the bill and VAT on alcohol which added about 20%."
"Stayed at the Taj Mahal in the Tower wing  in October 2018. The hotel is superbly situated and our room overlooked the ""Gateway of India"". The hotel is magnificent, a notable landmark in Mumbai. The public areas were spotless and the general atmosphere tranquil. The staff were extremely welcoming, courteous and efficient from the point of our arrival to our leaving. A must stay place."
Room- amazing view Surroundings- Gateway of India Food- Nice but the desserts and coffee are awesome Service- Quick room service  Good place for families  Lot of shops don like Louis Vuitton Gucci and many more
"Spent the last 2 nights of our indian trip here.  Have always wanted to, following TV documentary.  We were in the new wing, room small & disappointing.  It did have amazing views though.  Next time would opt for a larger room.  Pool area & service second to none.  Chinese restaurant v good.  Bbq restaurant good, amazing service from  bhavin, thank you bhavin. "
This hotel was built at the turn of the last century and it shows its splendor even after 100 years pass on it. The service was immaculate. The food quality depended on the restaurant. Some were ok while others were perfect.
"This is certainly one of the best and unique hotels in the world. Special atmosphere, excellent breakfast, wide range of restaurants and lovely pool. Welcome really Grant's the visitor a lovely feeling I have never experienced elsewhere. Easy access to nearby attractions and restaurants. Worth the price."
"Great disappointed at The Taj Mahal Mumbai after staying with The Taj Udaipur, The Taj Amritsar, The Taj Chandigarh. Whether it was hospitality, service, concierge they all do not stand par with the name. Very average. One's presence any where in the hotel is not acknowledge by the hotel staff, you get lost in the local crowd. Missing hostess at the restaurants, long wait for the phones to answer was a very common feature. Certainly not a five star service by any standards."
A must at least oance in a lifetime. I am fortunate - I have been there multiple times over 40 yers of time. I will be back. Pool area breakfast is an experiance. The service is excellent. The saloon is cheap if you need a haircut. Give tip - they are verry skilled.
I stayed at the heritage wing of the hotel and spent couple of nights in a very relaxed and pampered style. Thank you very much The Taj Hotel stuff and management. The hotel have all the modern facilities with an elegant look.
"Been to this property earlier a couple of times, but, visited this time with entire family. As usual, Stay was excellent with extraordinary service by entire staff. Special mention goes to Ms Divya Sanil who received us at the entrance, Mr.Wasim and Mr. Varun at the reception who did smooth check-in and check-out, Mr.Chandrakanth from room service who decorated room and bath tub for my daughter birthday, Guest Relationship Executive, Ms. Natasha who arranged cake and other arrangements for birthday at short notice, Mr. Akshay in Shamiana Restaurant for fine dining and entire staff of the property. It is a wonderful experience for our family in total. Thanks TAJ, you are the best."
"This hotel is literally an oasis in a sea of congestion, pollution, and poverty.  Once you walk through the front door you are greeted by the front desk lady, dressed in a beautiful sari.  We are offered tea and candies as we are being checked in.  Then we are led, by this same person, to our room.  On the way we are introduced to our personal butler.  In the room are complementary chocolates and nuts.  Each day, after sightseeing, we return to a bath drawn with floating rose petals.  Definitely worth the splurge."
This restaurant at the Taj Mahal Hotel has been given a facelift in the last couple of years. It moved its location to the lobby level which seems to attract more diners. The restaurant has a black and off-white theme running through it make it feel far more elegant than just a regular all-day dining at the hotel. One wall is dedicated to old photographs from the hotel and its esteemed guests over the years much like they have in their corridor. There is an unobtrusive open kitchen 
"The sign of an excellent hotel is never wanting to leave which is exactly how I felt about the Taj. It’s an incredible experience. We stayed in the historic side of the property where you feel the opulence of a bygone era. The rooms were well appointed, the restaurants had an amazing array of great food, and the pool was absolutely perfect. Threading throughout the stay was the staff - every single person was gracious and welcoming, each experts in their own field. The highlight was when I went to workout for a bit and instead ended getting a personal training session with Imtiyaz. He is passionate about health and helping his clients improve their fitness no matter their skill level. It was such a fulfilling hour of my trip and brought so much happiness. I can’t say enough"
"Having heard so much About Taj Mahal Palace My wife booked this place as surrprise for my birthday. The stay was ordinary, it has great location but i guess crowd they draw is more than what they can manage. Adding to our misery was the navy day celebration. We felt completely ignored at this place.   I would rate Trident to be much much better as an experience. But the great heritage this property has is for real. They surely lack hospitality now. It would be my last stay with any Taj Group property. "
"What a hotel! Right in the heart of Mumbai this iconic hotel has the service to match its amazing history.  Right from check in to check out, the butler service, breakfast buffet and food options are second to none. Reception staff check in the room is very fast and efficient, the butler services are prompt and extremely friendly and the food options are better than most hotels. A must stay in Mumbai for anyone visiting."
"i had the most incredible stay at the Taj Mahal Palace, from the minute we stepped foot into the hotel we were treated like princesses. I came for a business trip stay 1 night at the hotel. Every time we would be greeted with little surprise gifts from Binds when  on the side, to chocolates, flowers, bath treatments etc. Can honestly say this was one of the very best hotels i have stayed at across the world. The service was excellent, the hotel beautiful, the pool amazing, location ....everything "
"Now you can stay inside the Taj Mahal! The Taj Mahal in Agra is one of the most beautiful monuments in the world! ... According to the plans of Ministry of Tourism, people will now be allowed to stay inside the Taj Mahal. Part of the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, this hotel is considered the flagship property of the group and contains 560 rooms and 44 suites. There are some 1,600 staff including 35 butlers. "
"The palace part is small and you have to go to the tower for all the restaurants it is open to the public which means it’s very busy long queues for the rest rooms lounges full very small revolving door into the hotel  no driveway so it’s mad trying to get in and out the food not great and the staff not as friendly as you would have thought I would not stay there again as the pool was small, and freezing cold  they want you to use the tower reception so why charge to stay in the palace then very disappointed with the hotel "
"We were very let down by the Hi-tea experience!  I booked the Maharajas Hi-tea 2 months ago in November, for hi tea in January, personally with the Assistant restaurant manager in three email conversations. He promised he would make the booking, even asked if it was a special occasion and I replied saying it was my husbands birthday.   When I went to confirm the booking the morning of the tea they had no booking and didn’t even apologise. Just rebooked us in with no apology or a smile.   I would say the food was very average, service below average for what is meant to be a superior hotel, and for the £100 plus we were paying for the ‘privilege’ we had to ask each time we wanted tea.  They didn’t leave the pot on the table and never came to offer another cup. We even noticed"
"Excellent all along our stay. Warm and efficient staff, large room in the historical part of the hotel, marvellous restaurants and leisure areas. The staff thinks of what you could have forgotten without needing to ask. For example: if you wear glasses, you find a cleaning towelette on the bedside table ; if you read a book, you find a page holder at the right page; and so on... "
"The best first impression of India. The place is incredibly clean, the restaurants impeccable, and the views out of this world. If you can, you absolutely MUST stay in this hotel in Mumbai. It is, without a doubt, iconic for a reason. Also, I highly recommend getting a masala omelette and chai with breakfast. Don't go for the usual European stuff. That's not what we're known for."
They will kill you with kindness.  And after numerous stays I can tell you they are for real.   Tips  Get a harbor view room  There’s little difference between the tower wing and the palace wing  Hang out in the lobby and at the pool.   If you’re in the palace the smaller breakfast at the pool is fun  Great gym. Massage. Yoga.   Know that this is no bargain. But they won’t fail you.
"me and my husband are very fond of Mumbai monsoon and so we ensure to visit here during that time. during outlast visit in June 108, we decided to experience this place. And what a stay and what an experience. From being greeted at the reception to ensure we had comfortable and luxurious stay, the staff took care of us like we are their family and kids. every time we could return to our room, things were nicely re-arranged, re-filled. Everyone at this place is smiling and courteous. the decor and interiors depict larger than life feel.  PS; do take their property tour, which happens every evening and they told us so many interesting things bout the place. and also shows you around the entire property which otherwise you would not go. Plenty of food options and all better than"
"We stayed at the taj Tower for two nights and everything was perfect, from the room, the staff, the pool,the location. I would definitely return. In the 60+ hotel I visit per year, it easily enters my top 10."
This was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  The hotel pays much attention to detail and tries to please.  The rooms are beautiful and comfortable and all needs are taken care of.  Service at every level was excellent and we were appreciative of the upgrade from the Towers to the Palace.  Definitely a place to return to.  
"This hotel provides you everything. Luxurious living standards, service and hospitality at its best. From the time you check in you are made to feel so genuinely welcomed, ALL the staff are so polite and provide amazing service "
"Absolutely fantastic place to stay the hotel and rooms are beautiful, the staff can't do enough for you they cater for our every need to me this is pure luxury, we will definitely come back as soon as we possibly can thank you everyone."
what a bizar buitifull building! I was amazed by its buity and glad I finaly saw it.Unfortunately again as with the other attractions I visitid the nerving rourguides tuk ruk drivers and souvenir sellers are realy a downside again.They just wont let go when I say no. But you shuold have seen this place once in your libe
The location is incomparable next to gateway of india monument in downtown  mumbai with sea facing rooms and sea lounge which is exceptional. The rooms are well furnished. The service is impeccable. The food in wasabi( Japanese) soul[ middle eastern] golden dragon( Chinese) and masala craft( indian) was great. Some south indian dishes would add variety. The lobby gets over crowded sometimes.
"This was the first stop on my India adventure! This southern city is charming, fast paced and beautiful. The Taj Mumbai had the best staff, pool, and views of the water. Lots of history in this lovely place. "
"It’s the little things that make a difference and separate the good from the great, and the Taj Mahal does this in abundance.   We all know it’s an iconic hotel and location, and the facilities are first class.  However, it’s the people and the service provided that make a stay at this hotel so special.  We loved our stay here and would recommend anyone considering a 5-star Mumbai hotel they choose the Taj Mahal Palace.   "
"Definitively recommend the Shamiana restaurant for all day casual dining. Food was yummy and service impeccable, absolute true to the Taj experience.   It was so touching to visit the memorial in the main lobby."
Coming after about 40 years Taj Hospitality  has lived up to its reputation as ever! Many a things have changed and many have remained the same! The staff make the hotel what it is. If I were to take names the list will be too long! Best wishes to each one of them.
"Was great stay , super food and amazing Hospitality. Big thank you to  Shekhar Chowdhary of Golden Dragon for memorable dinner. Also special Thank you to Rahul Malgudi who has taken care in our entire stay."
"Absolutely spellbound when waiters refuse to provide me and my colleagues water as they have lifted them not realizing our dinner after a function attended by the chief minister and the president of India.  As if this was not enough when someone suggested to get an extra glass of water as we are tea totaller,the staff rudely told us this is the policy approved by our senior management. So much for the  taj hospitality ."
"The team here provide the best service we have ever experienced.  It’s a special event for us and they went all the way to provide the best possible service you can imagine.   The room was so romantically decorated, running a warm bath with rose petals, and celebratory pillows (I challenge you to name one other hotel that does that!)   A truly unforgettable experience.  Reetika, Krish and Rodney deserve a very special mention.  Thank you to this amazing hotel team for providing the #1 service we have ever had."
Amazing staff and organisation on the night. Well rehearsed. Splendid luxury all the way. Stefi Pinto was particularly helpful; amazing host. Well done.. Taj Palace is a true splendor  and doesn't disappoint - amazing location.
"After my solo visit here in March, I was excited to return with my family, having told them to expect serenity, opulence, class and a sense of a bygone age. Unfortunately, we arrived on Xmas day and what we were actually greeted by was noise, crowds, clatter and the feel of a hotel straight off the Vegas strip. There was no welcome, no red dot on my forehead or garland - so we were left to navigate the crowds and make our way to the check-in desk. Our check-in-er (not sure of the correct term and can’t remember her name) escorted us to the exclusive Palace Wing lounge (can’t remember the name of that either) but it was full, so we stood awkwardly in front of the lifts whilst our dots were hurriedly applied, garlands thrown over our necks, welcoming drinks were ordered and our"
"My husband suggested I stay at one of his favorite Taj Hotels when I went to Mumbai. Situated next to Indian Gate where the last British governor Lord Mountbatten, Prince Phillip’s Uncle, departed India taking the entire government with him. It’s history is played over a fifteen minute doc short on the hotel’s channel. The point is the Taj is in a beautiful area of old Bombay now Mumbai and is steeped in history as well as elegance.   I choose to stay in the newer tower building. I know it is cheaper and lacks the Butler amenities of the historic section. However knowing this is a renovated building, I prefer to stay where bathroom and amenities are more modern. My room was very nice, quiet and had a city and partial harbor view. The toilet did not smell. The bed, pillows and"
"Everything was great, hospitality is beyond imagination . The way they take care of guests is beauteous, from checking in to resting, to heritage walk, to dinner, to lobby Christmas celebration  everything was super...."
"Amazing.  The very very best in hospitality, no detail left to chance.  All staff were simply wonderful, working together seamlessly to create a harmony making all of the effort seem effortless.  In particular the reception desk, concierge, housekeeping and catering teams.  We were welcomed at 4.30am, with all arrangements taken care of, and even at that hour, were welcomed with (much needed) refreshments. 24 hour butler service was indulgent!  Breakfast rooms are wonderful with breathtaking views of the Gateway.  Pool area a wonderful space with poolside barbeque.  Only guest access so quiet and safe.  The daily free heritage tour of the hotel is a must.  So much history in this building and a wonderful story behind its foundation and philosophy - Mr Tata built this hotel to"
"This trip meant a lot to me as I was showcasing the city that means so much to me - Amchi Mumbai! I grew up here and my sister and I have such wonderful memories of this city that we love to keep coming back. I usually visit Mumbai on on business at least once / year and this was special since it was my family (including my infant).  Needless to say, the Taj Mahal Palace hotel lived up to its reputation of being one of India’s #1 hotels!  The views of the Gateway of India from our room window with the mighty Arabian Sea lapping it’s waves down below and the ships on the horizon were breathtaking, the ambience is like living in a Maharaja’s palace, the royal heritage of the hotel is to be seen to believe and the amazing tours are informative!  I am a Tata fan and began my career"
"We stayed for one day, just casually told the receptionist the occasion was a birthday and by the time we entered the room it was decorated with rose petals .. Taj never ceases to surprise you.   taking the tour of the hotel alone will take 2 hours."
"A large hotel that can feel a little too big at times, is offset by great service and terrific a amenities.  We stay in an Executive Suite which was recently renovated, and we'd highly recommend.  Gym is very nice but a little small for property this size and stuck in basement."
Excellent. Felt like royalty. Will be back again. Staff very dedicated and eager to make you feel welcome and great hospitality. Upgraded to Taj Palace and what a wonderful surprise. Sea lounge overlooking Gate of India wonderful breakfast. Thank you to all the wonderful staff. 
"As many before me have said, the service is simply amazing. Each day when you return, there is a little gift (face wash, lip balm, bubble bath) left for you along with all your water bottle restocked and flower petals tastefully arranged somewhere.  The best breakfasts I’ve ever had are in India, and the Taj didn’t disappoint. Staying in the palace side, we had two options. 1) The buffet on the first floor in Shamiana(?) or 2) smaller buffet and more table service at the Sea Lounge. They are slightly different.  The bigger buffet has lots of Indian and Western food on display - idols, waffles, halwa, baked goods etc. You can also order paratha, dosa!, eggs and other western and Indian foods.  The Sea Lounge is gorgeous and so old world. It has lush seats and mahogany tables with"
"This is a sensational hotel, and a real experience to stay there . I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it from the warm welcome to an efficient departure.  Having booked a Taj Club room I enjoyed the extra benefits on offer , such as afternoon tea and a brandy after dinner - all served in beautifully surroundings. The butler service and attention to detail were incredible. In particular, Gaurav was very helpful in the lounge and took time to talk about my time in India.  I would recommend the hotel tour, which brings to life the incredible history of the hotel. The pool area is beautiful and I enjoyed a great morning yoga session before the flight home that day.  Thank you to all the hotel."
"Excellent service, we were treated like royalty. Location and view of Gate of India...memorable. We book with concierge service for tour to Elefanta Caves with Shabbir,  and was the perfect guide to learn about the caves and Mumbai. Wish to visit and stay again."
The Harbour Bar is an awesome place to be with your near and dear ones.The views from the Bar are lovely.It is one of the best bar in Mumbai .Ideal for couples and family .The Staff is warm and courteous .
"We checked in on Xmas eve and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Stayed in the palace wing on the 4th floor. Recommend staying in the palace wing with a view of the sea if you can spend a bit. Totally worth it. Breakfast was excellent and you can choose to have breakfast at Poolside, Shamiana or Sea Lounge. All were great. Few hotels anywhere allow you to have variety in breakfast locations. Butler for the room was very helpful and servicing of rooms was very attentive.   Only issue is communication with some of the staff. We had communicated some special birthday arrangement but some info go lost due to miscommunication with various staff members.   Spa was quite good, make a reservation in advance for the couples room."
Amazing experience to stay in the oldest luxury property of Mumbai - a piece of history that has seen its ups and downs. Amazing staff all the way with the traditional customer at the centre approach. Makes you feel warm and welcome.The rooms are spic and span and always well kept and the facilities all the way were helpful. The entry into the hotel at times can be tricky and time consuming while in a vehicle considering the VIP movement and overall traffic in the area so just keep some extra time to arrive and depart.
Always wanted to come here and wasn't disappointed from the moment you walk in the door you are treated like royalty we booked the airport pickup the service starts there first class truly one of the worlds best hotels
"This is the only place to stay in Mumbai. Everything is tip-top; rooms, public areas, restaurants, swimming pool, location and service.   We always stay in the original part of the hotel, which is full of history and character.   Simply wonderful. "
i have married in dec of 2017 at my anniversary dec 2018 i have decided to take me wife as a dinner at mumbai hotel i have taken the mostly support of trip advisor app and i have srprised at the hotel at the night dinner that was the beautiful day of my life.
"I stayed a week in this palace in May 2018. I've stayed in 2 other palaces in the Gulf previously, and in all honesty, the Taj Mahal Palace was the absolute BEST!!! Upon check-in, I was upgraded from a tower room to a palace room with lounge access. The service at this palace is next to no other. Every single staff member I encountered in this hotel was very pleasant and courteous. Many times, staff members were attending to other guests or working on something else, but would stop what they were doing to say Hello or ask how my day was going. I've never encountered this level of professionalism in any hotel I've stayed in and I've traveled to 30+ countries. It was a very personal and touching experience. The property itself is very stunning and has a deep-rooted historical"
"What can I say except that the Taj Palace sets a standard at which all ultra luxury hotels should be judged. Everything, and I mean everything, was excellent; and the staff beyond comparison. I highly recommend this hotel. "
"We spent 4 nights in the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai and is probably the BEST hotel in Mumbai.  This emblematic hotel is overwhelming in its history and architecture.  The location is perfect and our room offered views of the Gateway Of India.  Check-in was fast and very welcoming.  The rooms are modern, very very comfortable and have fast and reliable WiFi. We were on a bed and breakfast basis and the buffet breakfast was very varied (both Indian and European dishes) and of excellent quality. The Taj Mahal Palace (and Taj Mahal Tower) is an expensive hotel (we paid 300€ per night on B&B) and the extra services (restaurants and drinks) are expensive too... but this is a luxurious hotel with personal service and is worth it !"
"This is an iconic grand old hotel.  Spent a night here in one of their grand luxury suites.  They are huge, it took the butler 15 minutes just to show us around.  Service was impeccable, butler was on hand to press your clothes or tend to whatever you wanted.  Sushi at Wasabi by Morimoto was excellent, which was not something that I expected to find in India.  Spectacular location right across from the Gateway of India.  This does mean that there are lots of people and tourists outside of the hotel but security is quite tight, obviously, since the terroist attack."
"After the attack on the palace, security is very tight. More important the food was all just magnificent, service was extremely efficient. The tours and the docents well educated. Our room had a view of the Gate. It was remarkable. New flowers in the lobby pots everyday. A mixture of cultures in the lobby. Very comfortable rooms. Glad we stopped by."
"Hotel is no doubt the best, but the staffs are now quite arrogant. No welcoming no good bye coins. Slow check in process and late room dining. Ambiance is at its best, staffs and specially at reception need to be trained how to behave and welcome the guests"
"Taj Mahal palace hotel is amazing with very friendly and helpful staff. The breakfast and afternoon tea is delicious. The rooms overlooking the Gateway of India and sea was fabulous. Very enjoyable and comfortable stay, thanks to all the lovely staff. The staff who got the foot spa ready for us were very sweet. And a special thank you to Devia for making our stay truly unforgettable. Devia has been very kind and understanding. Thanks a ton guys."

As the name suggest it is one of the most royal hotel in mumbai. We did not stay for long duration as we had to catch a flight early morning but we were offered a complementary massage and it was awesome after tiring day in mumbai!
this is very nice hotel . aslo very clean . better to go in December .also staff was very friendly . the food are good but little hot the rice and curry . very good rooms with tv and all configurable stuff
"I am glad that this property was booked for my stay in Mumbai. Will continue to stay in the same, for me & my families future trips. Normally people choose hotels on offers & discounts But Taj Mahal Palace will be by choice. I just loved the care & affection of the entire team of Taj Mahal Palace Hotel & Towers and will choose it in future for the attention to details & customization to every need of an individual. It will be difficult to name everyone, but each member I met, was very kind and helpful. To name a few which caught my attention : Front Office - Ms. Pallabi Lamatia + Mohinder + Ms. Ankita, Jiyan, Varun, Palace Services - Vinod & Shekkar (4th Floor), Farookh & Manoj (2nd Floor),  Concierge - Sandeep & Anshul,  Sea Lounge - Rohan, Aditya, Sachin, Tixeira, Soniya,"
"I come to India every year, I love to stay at Taj Place , feels like going back home. The public has changed tjrough the years, sometimes a bit too busy , but attentive  service, ambience  and the good food always there . For me the best hotel in India !"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is founded by Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, you can get any type of food here ,having at exactly near sea located in Mumbai near gateway of India. Having All Facilites . The Most of the foreigners are stay here who came to india  "
"From the moment I checked in to the moment I checked out, I was unobtrusively looked after. The efficiency ang the obsequious courtesy of the hotel personnel was ttruly outstanding.The food was very good, but I would recommend reducing the quantity serve with a corresponding cut in prices. At the rate at which the hotel is going, I am sure much food is wasted at the end of the day"
"Its value for money, thats the deal availed as the iconic structure gives you a feel of staying at Taj. Over that, the food at Masala Craft restaurant is delicious. The location is matchless, just in front of the majestic Gateway of India."
A lovely old hotel . Well worth a visit . Afternoon tea was delightful. Great choices of teas. Sandwiches and pastries were delicious.  Great view of Gateway of India from our window seat. Be there early to nab one of these tables. Dress code appeared relaxed.
"Although I say this is the very best place we ever stayed, the history of the building, and the fact that sightseers come to see it, make it special very-large rooms. We stayed in the Heritage wing and enjoyed our stay. The customer service was especially excellent."
"Although I can't say this is the very best place we ever stayed, the history of the building, and the fact that sightseers come to see it, make it special despite the not-very-large rooms. We stayed in the Heritage wing and enjoyed our stay. The customer service was especially excellent-"
"This hotel is fantastic! The service, the food, the rooms, just everything about it! FABULOUS! I would not even look at any other hotels in Mumbai! The service is beyond incredible and elegant but also friendly and approachable. We also booked a day tour with their car thru the concierge and were very happy! JUST FANTASTIC! Do yourself a favor and upgrade to the Club Level!"
"After our first wonderful stay at the Taj in 2015 we decided to return when we could.  This year saw us return for 3 nights in the old wing in the club rooms.  From collection at airport to our check out the level of service was beyond compare.  A wonderful welcome and as my wife had recently qualified as a nurse, they made a lovely gesture by placing a tray of sweets in the room made in shape of nursing equipment.  Room was wonderful. Spotlessly clean and large enough for our needs.  On floor butler staff were brilliant and their service exceptionally prompt.  Breakfast and evening meal were included in the package we booked. Breakfast was exceptional in terms of both choice and quality.  I made great use of the club features, such as free coffee throughout the day. My main"
"We stayed there for 3 nights  in September 2018 a treat from my daughter wonderful well come with garland,we were on the 8th floor of the new building Opp Gateway of India luxurious room fully equipped,its a very busy hotel with different kind of restaurants the food was delicious and bar service was excellent staff very polite and friendly. Over all good stay rather in a very very busy location but it’s Mumbai."
"We stayed at the imposing Taj Mahal Palace for one night in November at the start of our India holiday.  We had room 409 in the newer Tower View block with a view of the Gateway of India arch and the sea beyond and woke up to a hazy sunrise over the Gateway monument.  We had a smart, spacious room with a large comfy bed and a nice lounge area. Dressing gowns provided plus complimentary slippers, tea/coffee making facilities, mini-bar, air con, large TV with BBC World News, room safe, iron/ironing board, free Wi-Fi, laundry services and complimentary bottles of mineral water. Our room was facing the main street so it was rather noisy with beeping horns and barking dogs during the day.  A bit quieter at nights but there was always some noise. We had a turn down service during the"
"I stayed in Taj for 2 days and I could feel the luxury Indian architecture and vibes all that time. Located just  opposite Gateway of India, it is a monument itself. Even though I didn’t like their tea lounge, it seemed over priced and tea wasn’t upto the mark either."
Could not fault anything from anyone at any department we came in contact with. it was the best stay with total overall satisfaction. Great hotel with most gracious and very professional personnel committed to service.
"After a long flight and the busy traffic from the Airport, tranquility and a welcome to surpass all welcomes, and that was only the beginning. We had a wonderful room overlooking the Gateway of India, really friendly and so well trained staff that you wanted for nothing.  Superb food including a Michelin Star Dinner in The Chambers Room on one of our two nights and equally impressive Chinese Food in the Golden Dragon Restaurant on the other, to say nothing of very tasty snacks by the pool. My first trip to India and I want to go back already.  Thank you everybody for making the difference."
"I probably stay in 50 hotels a year....many of those nothing special, but a decent number of higher end luxury properties. The Taj Palace though stands out as really special.  Sure the facilities are great, the room furnishings high quality, the restaurants quite good....but there’s something else special about this place. The ambience, the service....it’s just something unique, every detail about delivering a great experience. It’s a trip back in time in a way.  Sure the neighborhood while historic may not be super convenient for a lot of things today. But stay here at least two nights and just absorb the atmosphere."
"This is my first TripAdvisor review. The reason I'm finally writing a review (and not just reading them) is having just stayed in the Taj Mahal in Mumbai for a third time, it is easily one of my favourite hotels anywhere in the world. Here's why:   1) If you possibly can, stay in the Palace Wing as that's where you fully appreciate this iconic building that oozes charm, style and history. We stayed on the 6th floor (the club floor, and where some of the suites are) which has great views of India Gate and the Arabian sea, plus a wonderful arched ceiling given its the top floor. No matter where you stay in the Palace Wing though, it is littered with wonderful art, and take every opportunity to walk down the grand staircase.   2) The hotel has two of my favourite places to lounge"
"This hotel lives up to its reputation. What a well appointed property, what wonderful service and hospitality . Right from the concierge to the front desk, housekeeping, Wi-Fi , room service and facilities, everything is really well thought through and executed to perfection. Check in was quick and efficient . There was a glitch in my settlement details , but the person at the desk magnanimously said that they would sort that out later ..” please proceed to your room and rest “ …How kind is that ! The rooms in the Tower Wing are a bit small and snug, but everything works well. The toilet amenities are luxurious and the linen and towels are of high quality. I wish they would have a steam iron instead of the regular and cheap version. Laundry was very good and efficient . Room"
My dream come true moment is when I saw first time in my life huge hotel and beautiful moment is Taj built by a English architecture I love it and best is when I saw there are seats there I lv it and my dream come true
Attention to detail butler services is to be commended service by all staff is excellent afternoon tea in the lounge is delightful food is excellent what more can I say it's the Taj an a experience of a lifetime 
"It’s best and fantastic hotels for friends, family, couples, and for everyone. It has great decorations all over the hotel. It’s best hotel and great tourism . It has best tourist attraction all over the world"
"We stayed for one night in November on a 14 night/6 property trip, and having toured in India previously, this review is relatively objective.   We opted for an airport meet & greet and transfer to the Taj - not the cheapest, but worth every penny. Efficient, safe and non stressful, with the bonus that upon arrival, we were immediately whisked directly to our room in the Tower and checked in there via iPad by a most efficient and pleasant staff member.  Our room on the 19th floor provided an excellent view over the Gateway area. Modern and as expected, very well equipped and comfortable, adequately sized, if a little compact.  The Masala Craft restaurant was excellent and is highly recommended for ambience, food and service.  The buffet breakfast was world class.  The pool area"
This hotel is very good and serve many types of world wild foods verites it's developed by tata company on the top floor tata's pent house is very good services giVen by taj hotel place. This place is very owesom
Ecellent service throughout my stay. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I would highly recomand this hotel to my friends. Will be back soon  Thanks for the excellent breakfast Room was amazing thanks to front office for the quick check in
"Me and my wife stayed in The Taj Mahal Palace at Mumbai for two nights ( the old hotel not the Taj Towers) .....  being a regular traveller I have been lucky to have stayed in large number of wonderful properties all over the world to include Oberoi’s, Marriott, Sofitel etc as also a large number of Taj properties all over India. But I can say without a doubt that the service and sense of hospitality that we got here was unparalleled. The team there really believes in treating guests as true VIPs and then to add to it the lovely property and ambiance. Besides having amazing facilities such as the lovely sea harbour bar, beautiful rooms, scrumptious breakfast etc it is also the history associated with the place which is amazing. I would recommend at one and all that a stay here"
"A wonderful introduction to India. We stayed in the Tower, with a fabulous view of the Gateway to India. Our room was comfortable but we found it difficult to feel at home since our toiletries kept being removed from the bathroom to a cupboard. Breakfast was a grand feast - other meals somewhat slow to arrive but tasty.."
"I am a world and a luxury traveler. My favorite places to stay are special and I do prefer unique boutique hotels for its personal touch and service.  Taj Mahal Palace is a big brand hotel that manages to feel personal and unique at the same time. I loved my stay here.   The hotel's entrance is quite disorienting because it shares an entrance with the Taj Tower. Since I did not book it myself nor read about it ahead, I was surprised. The hotel lobby was busy but once we entered the Palace wing, I sense its specialness right away. The hall smelled good and felt quite cozy because unlike other 5 star huge brands with grand and high-ceilings, this has the opposite, perhaps to be expected of a hotel 115 years old.   The club suites are a treat. You have a butler. The building while"
This is a must whenever you are in Mumbai. No excuse is valid enough to pass by and to have a meal in the Shamina or Marsala Kraft restaurants. For the residentschap there is also the Aquarius restaurant at the pool.
"Nice place, one of the 7 wonders in the world, just go and feel the beauti of nature, if you. Want peace than this place is best for you , no other can touch the hight of it, one of the best moments of  my life ."
We were group of ten friends and stayed here for two nights.. Very comfortable and well managed property.every single penny is worth of spent... staff is very helpful and friendly.spot less and spacious rooms... bathrooms r hignic and romantic...food is very delicious.. nothing to complain about.. thanks for wonderful stayed... recommend
"A very nice hotel where you feel valued and pampered. The hotel staff treat you like price and princess. Security is excellent for the entry in the building. Good to note that outside food are not allowed to be brought to be eaten in the room. The hotel is located in the centre of Colaba town where there are many shops, bazaar and restaurants around. To move around the town, there are taxis on the taxi stand next to the hotel. "
I visited on my birthday 25th november. Everything was perfect. Food was awesome. Lobby is lavish. Rooms r beautiful. Hotel People are very nice. Views of sea and india gate are worth watching. Would love to cum bak again.
Nice and this is very beautiful place and he is nice hestrical place of India and very nice place I  visited in evary year my family and friend. I like this place and my friend. L love you this place ok
"Exceptional exceptional service with a smile.  Agreed you have many hotels, but you have to just try it once to experience the Taj uniqueness.  There were several instances which just amazed me.  I would love to list them for you but then it would kill the joy of the experience.  So go ahead and try it yourself, I know you will not regret it."
its in colaba area near to gateway of India. parking is available approx 500 m away from the taj hotel for buses. cars and small vehicle can go near the hotel. Tourist can go easily by walk form the parking. local bazar is situated near the parking
We stayed in the tower block with a view to Gateway of India.  The room was really lovely and a lot of thought has gone into the design.....everything works together flawlessly.  It is a very busy hotel and I think sometimes the staff are a little bit anonymous although very efficient and professional but then you find someone really friendly and your opinion changes.  The pool area and gym are first class with a large pool you can actually swim in and a great gym.  The breakfast buffet was the best we had during our month in India.  We ate at Souks one night which was great.  I would highly recommend this hotel and just wish we had longer than 2 nights.....maybe another time!
"We spent 1 night at the Taj Towers. All facets of our stay was excellent from the front desk, housekeeping, food and beverage, pool, gym etc. Flawless experience and this hotel does it so well. Congratulations to all at the Taj, well done and highly recommend for a becalming, relaxed stay. Thank you."
"We absolutely loved everything about this hotel.  The staff are very polite and very helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them.  There was  a lot of choice of good food at breakfast and you were never hurried to finish, it was very relaxing.  Lunch times and a couple of nights we ate outside near the pool and the choice of food was also very good.  We loved our room and the staff on our floor who took very good care of us, I can't fault them for anything they were so friendly and eager to please.  It is place I would love to visit again......hopefully one day."
"Beautiful property, great restaurants, and greater staff! This is a haven of sophistication and civilization. The sanctuary of the pool was our favourite part, with snacks and drinks! The rooms in the tower are not huge, but perfectly adequate. The array of restaurants is impressive, from Indian to Japanese! We really enjoyed Masala Kraft, a taste of true India. The Harbour Bar is snug and friendly, with a splendid array of gins! I first stayed in the Taj 40 years ago, and it has expanded and regenerated to remain relevant to the present day, whilst paying homage to its incredible heritage! Highly recommended."
Visited the Elephanta Caves and on the way back stopped at the Taj for tea. Great historic hotel where numerous royalty and celebrities have stayed. Thing you can even do a tour of the hotel. High tea is excellent and a step back in time. 
The was excellent very friendly service was great food was great you can see the real Indian hospitality everything was excellent this tge fact the only tyi faced tge rate book.com gave me was wrong tgey didn’t informed us anout 28% extra charges wa should pay. The money exchange when we paid in master card was so high but in any cas every thing was real exciting every one wants to gave you his mac to make you so happy . Room is so clean food was very good nothing to claim.I recommend all my friends to visit your hotel if they visit India Thank you so much for your help thank you so much for everything thank you so much for what been done to me during my trip hope i can visit you once again .After this visit I really love to come back again the people is great hod bless everyone
"Like the Lodhi in Delhi, this is one of the best places ever.  Staff is extremely attentive and welcoming, knows your needs before you do. Rooms are nice with decoration changing every day.  Breakfast can be taken in various places (including outdoor), including a good a la carte choice which I always prefer to buffets.  Pool is large enough for a proper swim, afternoon tea is included (depending on room category).  Hotel is of Course excellently located right next to India Gate and in Walking distance to many of Mumbai's sights."
Really enjoyed spending a few nights in this hotel. Very spacious reception and plenty of shops and restaurants in the vicinity and in the hotel. Was lovely food with a few choices for evening meals but was disappointed in the breakfast. Found that it was often cold and they took too long to see if you wanted coffee or tea. Service was excellent during the evening and the room was well maintained.
excellent location - a true land mark. Lovely interiors and great service. really great pool and outside space. this was our second visit and we will definitely be coming back. breakfast is incredible
"The majestic hotel with a red dome was opened on December 16, 1903 by Jamsetji Nasarwanji Tata, an outstanding industrialist. And since that time, it has become one of the most luxurious hotels in the world. All interior decoration was ordered in Europe. Many celebrities have stayed here.      Tata decided to build this magnificent hotel after he was forbidden to visit the Watsons Hotel, where there was a sign “Only for whites”. Today, the Taj Mahal with its Moorish arches and pillars, huge staircases and galleries remains one of the grandest hotel buildings in Asia, while Watsons is in oblivion.      The rooms are very cozy, but unfortunately, there is a strong smell of mold. In general, the service at the hotel is wonderful, but in the old part of the hotel, renovation is"
This is probably the one attraction that brought us to India and it did not disappoint. Before visiting do a little research on the place as the story of its building is as outstanding as the building itself. This is not just an attraction but a life experience and one not to be missed. 
You must see the Taj Mahal.. The foreniers pay 1100rp the only advantage is that you don't have to line up for hours to get in.. Best time to see the Taj Mahal around 2.30. Don't forget the Taj Mahal museum it's on the left.. and local 30/60rp= it's a shame every where you go in India the tickets for overseas people are 3x the price it really hurts the budget.. Plus tax for recycling_symbol green tax is a joke garbage and plastic every where even the cows which they love so much eat plastic no green grass or food unhealthy and deceased animals in parks.  But I tell you if they only knew how much pollution is killing the Taj Mahal.. The monument is built on wooden blocks it must have water to be stable.. It's drying up and the pollution is killing the marble cracks are appearing every day.  Let
"The hotel was so over priced, I have booked a room for five night with a flexible cancellation and I had to leave one night earlier but the hotel staff refused to check me out without paying for the whole period where I thought that was a cheating way of taking money that they don’t deserve. The front desk staff were so rude and not helpful at all. The whole staff will not help if you don’t pay them. I will never recommend this hotel to any of my friends. The restaurant where we had our breakfast was too smiley that we need to change our clothes after having breakfast plus the staff are not friendly. It was my biggest mistake in my life to stay in this hotel and I will never go back."
"Just stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for 4 nights attending a conference. Really a great place. My room was in the Palace, which is the really classic part of the hotel compared to the Tower. I loved it. Really stylish. Rooms nice with everything you need. Free Wifi is too slow and I need to upgrade by paying an additional amount. This should not be the case in a hotel of the category! Pool area very nice. Staff all great and very friendly."
"Back to Taj Mahal Palace Hotel Mumbai after some years - incidentally over the 10th commemoration day of the cruel and fetal attack on the hotel...Many thoughts coming up, but the hotel is vibrant as ever. No false sentiments but looking forward by offering finest hospitality and service starting from breakfast over High Tea in the Sea Lounge, a lunch the Golden Dragon with extraordinary authentic Chinese Cuisine to a Barbecue at the Poolside. Can’t remember, I ever had such good lamb chops! The flagship remains the flagship."
"Come to Mumbai for business trip and stayed here for 3 full weeks and is loving here! Every staff is attentive and friendly- just make you feel more like home than a home!  1) Prabhat the yoga instructor is perfect! I go to his morning yoga session by the pool nearly everyday. The posture and breathing practice energised me throughout the entire day of work. I had 2 private yoga sessions with Prabhat and he gave me insight which i havent got in my past 1.5 years of yoga practice. (Minor suggestion - The light in the yoga room cannot be shut down though, which is not suitable for the resting/meditation) 2) Jiva spa is perfect! Had two Indian aromatherapy sessions there, the staff is very skillful and i feel relaxed completely 3) Jeff the chef from Golden Dragon is amazing..i lost"
This hotel is one of the best of the Taj Group of hotels.The staff are very friendly and always ready for help.Not to forget the delicious food and the grand dining rooms.The hotel truly deserves a 7 star rating.
"We've always wanted to stay in this iconic hotel and it did not disappoint.  Great service, comfortable rooms and a beautiful building.  Well worth paying the extra for the sea view.  Excellent breakfast, but the one dinner we had was disappointing and costly."
"This place is magical with great ethos. Service is super impeccable and deserves a 7 star. Nothing is impossible for them and always go beyond to please you. Vibe of the place is amazing. Always wanted to stay here as a child born, bought up in Mumbai and it was fulfilled thru this stay"
"One of the best and most iconic hotels in Mumbai, it's worth a visit, one of the oldest and most famous properties of TAJ  group of hotels, service and food is also incredible.. Definitely worth a visit "
"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. It is important to mention that I was staying on the Palace wing, as there is another wing which is the Taj Maha Tower (tall building in the picture). This hotel is PURE HISTORY by itself, as they give you a free tour of the hotel and I believe it is open for public (not sure). Due to the category of my room I had 24 hour butler service, access to the Sea Lounge for included breakfast, free drinks and champagne and chocolate service after dinner. The pool of the hotel is great as well.  The room is ample and beautifully set. Walking distance from many interesting points as it is just in front of the Gate of India. Concierge service was great and they were able to setup a tour for me in no time with a guide and a car exclusively"
Stayed here for 1 night n it was an amazing experience. The hotel it self is so beautiful. It's a must visit of this iconic hotel of the city n India. True to it's class. The sea lounge has perfect view of the sea n the gateway of India. The food was amazing..love to be back here..
"One of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in. We had two rooms. My room overlooked the water and the gateway to India. I could have just sat all day and looked out the window. Airport transfers were great, water provided in the car and WiFi if you wanted. The hotel is large and stunning. It was about to be the ten year anniversary of the terrorist attack and it was hard to think that something so awful had happened here. It’s not hard now to understand the story of staff heroism as we experienced the kindness and exceptional service from the staff at the hotel. We were really looked after. We had club rooms in the palace and our butler was wonderful. Breakfast was lovely and we enjoyed the complimentary high tea, cocktails and the chocolates and brandy after dinner. Lots of treats"
"One of the best hotels I ever stayed in. If you go to Mumbai you should stay at this hotel, but not in the tower. You should stay in the old part which has been refurbished and is excellent. The room has a butler assigned to you who will look after you. The resturant by the pool is very convenient for a quick lunch or dinner. If you like sushi we would suggest that you take a look at the cost: we found it very expensive as compared with other sushi restaurants in the world (Nobu, etc.)"
"After reading the glowing reviews of the Taj Palace I was so looking forward to my stay.  On check in I was expecting the usual welcome drink but this was not offered until we were in our room.  Our room was serviced after our first night but the mugs were not changed and the tea and milk was not replenished. When we returned hot and thirsty from our sightseeing  I had to teleohone housekeeping for supplies, but these took nearly a hour to arrive.. In all other ways the hotel and food was lovely.. it was a shame that these things let down our stay."
"A wonderful stay with my wife over her birthday - service and support could not have been improved. A truly iconic, historic hotel - worth the money to stay here and very little to criticise at all. don't bother with the tower next door - it has to be the Palace!"
"My wife and I spent 4 nights in the Palace Wing. Stunning building, room, service, food and location. We loved the pool and I enjoyed the complimentary morning yoga class. Highest professional standards throughout. We agreed that this was the best hotel we have stayed in worldwide."
This hotel is amazing.  Every corridor you walk down is full of history. The staff are the jewel in the crown.  They make you feel so welcome and are very attentive.  We stayed in one of the club rooms for two nights.  We have taken great memories away which we will treasure forever.  Thank you for making us so welcome.
"If you can, stay in the Palace heritage wing, as opposed to the Towers - it's not that the service, rooms or standards are any different, it's the history and architecture that amaze. You get a sense for what the early 1900's must have been like for a traveler and the artwork and the staircase are essential viewing. The Sea Lounge for breakfast is an oasis of calm within a vibrant and energetic city."
"we are new couple first time come to india, We booked this hotel online, my friend told me about this hotel. really i thank you my friend i enjoyed this hotel last week. my wife more for this hotel view also its very near local market in mumbai, we enjoyed also out side, hotel staff give us some main point information & i enjoyed there, next day in morning very good breakfast and its very good.  highly recommend this hotel."
"The attention to detail and the personalised extras are what makes the stay here a standout. Yes the building and rooms are gorgeous, but it's the staff that make the difference. Steffi in the food and beverage and her manager are both bright stars. The manager for providing a masala tea tray in my room was an unexpected delight especially as he included written instructions with it. Steffi for the special care package left before a trip to Elephant Island to make the trip more comfortable.For me this was a once in a lifetime extravagence, but one I do not regret and will remember. Thank you all. "
"This is indeed and fully justified one of The leading Hotels of the World.  All staff members from bottom to top, with really no exception,  are excellent trained, very helpful and  absolutely friendly. Professionals everybody"
High tea came recommended but found it underwhelming. Service was extremely slow and not as opulent as excpected. Otherwise the hotel was beautiful. Old world charm and friendly greeting. Left before being served for high tea.
"One of the most beautiful places to visit in mumbai,it's connected to history and the beauty of the sea and activities like boating and all will for sure make your day, highly recommend to go with family and friends."
"Taj was an excellent experience, my kids enjoyed this most that is what matters to me the most. I will definately like to visit in future with the family. Overall service right from the enterance untill the exit was superb. Keep up the good service !!!cheers."
"This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The customer care was excellent. However, if you are looking for a quiet poolside retreat the noise on the Mumbai streets nearby can be annoying."
"This is a beautiful hotel for sure.  Expensively finished common areas, several restaurant/bar options and overall efficient service.  Retail opportunities abound.  Luggage delivery and pickup was irritatingly slow and a special request for additional hangars took forever.  It is generally noisy and crowded most of the time and our personal taste is for a more special, intimate experience.  But to give credit where credit is due, they have the best breakfast buffet in all of India bar none.  We also had an amazing dinner in the Indian restaurant  and impeccable service.  Our room was mediocre -- small with a small bathroom and a tiny vanity, not much storage room, narrow hallways getting to the room and the furniture in the room was almost modular in style.  We were unimpressed"
"My husband and I stayed at the Taj Palace Hotel in early November.  I would give five stars for the location, the room, and the service from the housekeeping staff. I would also give 5 stars for general cleanliness.  I would give three stars for how I, in particular, was treated.  I am  US citizen of Indian descent as is my husband.  What I experienced was disappointing to say the least.  The hotel has a very international set, so I was surprised to learn that when they encounter a couple like us, the male partner is greeted and asked how things are but the female is not.  When the chef comes to the table and asks how dinner is, the male partner is addressed and I am not even acknowledged as being present.  This was not true of the light skinned Europeans or Americans.  So Taj"
"We were visiting Mumbai on our India trip and although we didn't book any rooms at this hotel, we still wanted to try out Taj Palace Hotel for an evening meal as we were visiting ""Gateway of India"".  The hotel building is amazing, truly magnificent structure and the lobby aroma was just out of this world.   So, till this point we were happy to be there and decided to try ""Masala Kraft"", one of many restaurants within this facility. From the moment we entered, the hotel staff was listless and were business as usual. I felt they lacked warmth and special attention to us. I had a beer and we ordered food, before my wife suggested that this place is not worth our money (overpriced valuations) and time, so we decided to leave.   To be honest, I am disappointed and would not be"
I would expect nothing short of perfection at a Taj property and was not disappointed. When the staff learned I had a chest cold they recommended an herbal toddy and fetched cough medicine from the chemist. The heritage tour is a must. We also did the sailboat ride at sunset which was a nice retreat from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai that offered unique views of the waterfront. 
"I’m lost for words that accurately could describe  the experience of staying at the Taj Mahal Mumbai. Epitome of luxury, world class hotel, that will take your breath away & sweep you back to ancient traditions of unmatched perfectioned high end luxury hospitality. The hotel itself and the location opposite Gate of India and Arabian Sea is simply breathtaking. The service by the impeccable staff is unmatched from start to finish. The rooms are elegantly decorated with the most comfortable bed and bed linnen that will guarentee a refreshing rest. Highly recommended to book sea view. Thank you to Taj Hotel for an unforgettable stay and the upgrade to Apollo Suite. It was only for one night but I hope to return for extended stays. "
In hotel facility is oswm and most word is a good place in mumbai and one's more visit in hotel and staff and good foods and very good painting in this hotel and every things is normal. So enjoy the hotel and city.
"A magnificent hotel with great service . Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in.A beautiful hotel including much art work and beautiful furnishings.The staff is especially polite, helpful and warm. Great location."
Amazing stay at amazing place.Seen historic Taj Mahal palace along with friends.Had an amazing stay and love the serene atmosphere around the lovely palace.Good staff good crew amazing buffet arrangements
"I had long heard of The Taj as a hundred year of luxury hotel in Mumbai; it exceeded my expectations. The physical hotel is fabulous, but it's the over-the-top service that makes this a memorable experience. The flower petals arranged in a geometric pattern on the entry-way floor was my best memorys Expensive but well worth it"
"The whole stay was a pleasure from the start when they collect you at the airport, flawless checking into our room. Amazing service, Smiling friendly staff, Excellent quality of food, Tasteful décor, 5 stars all the way"
"This is an exceptional 5* hotel. From arriving to the beautiful lobby, to having lunch and dinner, breakfast, checking out, we were treated like royalty throughout and had a taste of true luxury.  Our room was beautiful and clean, with all of the amenities we needed. The food at the restaurant was excellent and I think quite reasonably priced for such a luxury hotel. Breakfast was plentiful and we were very well looked after.   It’s lovely to have the shops on site, the spa, choice of restaurants and pool area - there’s so much to do, we wished that we had stayed for a full week. We really hope to come back one day and stay longer.   "
"The fact that his historical hotel can offer such a high service level is outstanding. We don't remember being spoiled that much before. It started with a pleasant early check-in after a long flight. The next couple of days as Club room members were simply pure please with afternoon tea, pre-dinner canapes and drinks and different activities such as sunset sailing, heritage tour, and dinner in the restaurants. The service and food quality at The Chambers was out of this world and one of those rare memorable restaurant moments. The butler service in the room was discrete, but at the same time with fascinating service offerings, such a rose bath preparation and even a farewell gift.  The rooms are charming, comfortable and full of atmosphere.  The location also allows for nearby"
"Please let me start by saying that I have been fortunate enough to visit many countries and experience some of the best hotels in the World... and the Taj Hotel Mumbai is by far one of the best!  From the minute we arrived to the minute we left we were treated like Royalty! Our room was gorgeous and the staff couldn't do enough to make us feel comfortable, we were given gifts on a daily basis, our room was constantly filled with chocolates, roses and nice treats and Amol kept our bathroom & bedroom spotless!  I was a bit apprehensive travelling to India as it was my first time, however the hotel made us feel safe and welcome. The pool area and gardens are so beautiful and the food in the restaurants was delicious! I honestly can't find one single fault with this hotel. I"
"We had the most incredible stay at the Taj Mahal Palace, from the minute we stepped foot into the hotel we were treated like princesses. I came for a wedding with my best friend so we had a 3 day stay at the hotel. Everyday we would be greeted with little surprise gifts from Bindis when the housekeeping noticed our Sarees on the side, to chocolates, flowers, bath treatments etc. Can honestly say this was one of the very best hotels i have stayed at across the world. The service was excellent, the hotel beautiful, the pool amazing, location ....everything i cannot fault. We were also lucky enough to attend a wedding in the Crystal room. The barstaff remembered my drink order and would be ready with a drink as soon as i got to the bar. It really was out of this world amazing."
"It was a SURPRISE gift given by our Children on our Silver Wedding Anniversary. Thier dream has been perfectly executed by staff of The Taj Mahal Palace. It is a visit for Excellent service, Courteous staff, great Ambiance and ROYAL treatment. MUST for once in life time. Worth the experiance. "
Splendid surroundings. Lovely food in every restaurant and fantastic service by all - particularly Mystery who made our afternoons in the Harbour Bar even more serene and delightful!  We also did the sunset cruise - fantastic! It was like a Duran Duran video but better
"Loved every minute after I stepped into the property. I was there to celebrate my wife’s birthday and everything they organised was picture perfect. Staff is absolutely brilliant and lives by customer experience at each step of interaction. Chef was accommodating our multiple requests for specific food preparation for my toddler. The best thing was surprise they arranged on the birthday night by setting up a red carpet, decorating the rooms with our pictures and ballon with cake. Their pool side Restraunt setup was top notch and is a must for spending an evening. I highly recommend this property if you want to experience the best service, property and food. "
Probably the best hotel we've ever stayed in with amazing service. We will certainly be returning.  Incredible room and  housekeeping details.      And the a staff hospitality was impeccable.  Great fun for sure.                                         
"I had the pleasure of spending two nights at the Taj and was overwhelmed by the hospitality, history, and understated luxury.   What really differentiated the stay from the other luxury hotels I’ve frequented in India for business is the level of service. The staff went above and beyond to anticipate my needs - remembering my preferences of water on the patio, putting chocolates in my room after I commented how much I enjoyed the patisserie, and the quick action taken to anticipate my needs when my baggage was delayed.  The shops were very special as well. While more expensive than the bazaars and shops in colaba, the two dresses I found at Ahilaya are one of a kind and of the finest silks - treasures!  This is a wonderful hotel that I can’t wait to revisit.   "
"This was our second visit and it was just as wonderful as we remembered, staying in the historic/palace wing again. Our room this time overlooked the Gateway of India, which was nice, however still had that musty mildew smell from the air conditioning system. They offered us a different room but from last time I knew that was a pointless exercise. I got them to open the windows, bring in a dehumidifier, however it did little. The next day as I was going out the manager stopped me and said they would like to move us to a Club Room in the historic/palace wing.  It had a wooden floor so maybe it would be better, plus had extra benefits, free cocktails, butler service and free pressing, the latter we did not use. I'm afraid the room had the same smell and also did not have a bath,"
"You can't ever say anything which suffices the charm of this land mark hotel. Every step down the corridors , is like a step down the yester years. With so much history in it's verandah's and porches you can not end being nostalgic . Add to that the Taj hospitality, food and views to die for- and there you have a perfect destination.   Have been to this hotel quite a few times, but this was my first stay here. Enjoyed every bit of it. The only draw back is the non-sea facing rooms- which leave much to be desired for with their small size.  Would love to come back again and enjoy the hospitality."
"We spent 3 nights here at the end of a holiday touring Bhutan and West Bengal. This was the perfect hotel in which to unwind and enjoy Mumbai. On arrival we were upgraded from a room in the Taj Tower to the heritage palace. We were given Ccess to the concierge lounge where we could call in for drinks and snacks.  Our room was amazing! More of a suite, really... an entrance hall with wardrobes, fridge and safe, a big bathroom with separate bath and shower as well as excellent amenities, then the bedroom with a very comfortable double bed. Every day our butler delivered nuts and chocolates. The chocolates were presented on a bed of coffee beans. When I mentioned that I don’t like coffee fresh chocolates were brought and every day after my chocolates were on a plate without the"
"What can go wrong at the Taj Mahal Palace? In one word ..... Nothing. Been to this place on several occasions around the year and it just won't disappoint. The decor immaculate, the staff well informed and polite, the food not only perfect designed but tastes very good.  Finally the coffee and tea that me and my family is spot on. We call for a pot of  brewed coffee and a pot of Jasmine tea.  Both delivered to perfection. Great place and not obnoxiously expensive."
"As a frequent traveller and frequent guest in many Taj hotels, The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai demonstrates the highest level of personal individual attention, service and outstanding and commanding luxury in terms of decoration of rooms and focus on details in all areas of the hotel,from pool to restaurants,from room service to reception. They are able to create an atmosphere being at home."
"Fabulous accommodation, wonderful food in all restaurants and really excellent and helpful service.  Each member of staff will take responsibility for any query you raise.  The staff are friendly and respectful, not over-formal."
"From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty! The staff is beyond incredible in delivering an experience like no other!! The first person we encountered was Natasha at check-in who greeted us with a welcome ceremony and arranged a hotel tour for us the next day, which was given by Harshal. Both of these ladies were so delightful, friendly, and knowledgeable. Parminder greeted us at the door every time we left and came back, and remembered us each time. He also provided us with help whenever we needed it. Each morning, we had breakfast in the beautiful Sea Lounge, and we were provided with excellent service by Ershad, Chaskar, Sujit, and Kiran. We even enjoyed the Afternoon Tea in the Sea Lounge one afternoon for their fantastic buffet. And the hostess, Madonna, made"
Beautiful from start to finish. Service is unbelievable. Pool area is stunning. Rooms are gorgeous. This hotel is amazing and so central. Everything is within walking distance. Would definitely return!
Had a amazing stay at the Taj. The hotel is situated in a great location with plenty to see and do. The breakfast buffet was outstanding and with wide variety. The fresh cold pressed juices were excellent. Supper overall service and large clean rooms.
"Just got back from a 4 day stay and this hotel is lovely. We were upgraded to the Palace and the rooms were perfect. Clean, specious and comfortable. I've never stayed any where like this before and to be honest it was difficult to adjust to the very attentive staff and constant surprises in room service, petals along the bath and mirror in a different design daily anyone!? All the staff were very friendly and welcoming.  The are a variety of restaurants available on site with a variety of good vegetarian options. The concierge gave us a few pointers on what to do in Mumbai, although there didn't seem to be much, but we would recommend the City tour and Slum tour, Ovis and Raz were very knowledgeable and friendly and made us feel welcome and safe in a city they were obviously"
"We spent 4 nights at this amazing hotel & would definitely return!! The history is so interesting, the rooms spacious & so clean, the staff exceptional, the pool so refreshing & all the facilities outstanding!! Sunil, our waiter each morning was absolutely outstanding!! On our last day & gave us a special surprise at breakfast, a bon voyage cake!! We loved staying here & could not fault a thing. "
What a magnificent hotel and facilities for a guest.  You will be treated as a king on your stay at this wonderful hotel.  I believe this the oldest 5 star deluxe hotel of our country and they ensure the amenities and services are catered as per the latest market trend to offer uniqueness and value to their patrons.  Apart from waiting at coffee shop during the breakfast   Everything else was simply fantastic - no comparison in any sense   Cheers
"I was there for 3 nights in September 2018, impeccable service, very caring and polite staff. Very clean, helpful and exceptional decor all over the place. And to boot great restaurants!!! Will definitely visit again"
"We have visited the Taj in the past and it was excellent in every respect. Since then it has been renovated so looks very good. However, the service has slipped down a notch or two. A 15 minute wait to get a glass of wine in more than one of the bars was not unusual. It took 3 successive breakfasts to get boiled eggs in eggcups rather than in a bowl and even then there was no spoon to eat the egg with! The number of business class rooms have been increased, so the club lounge is now much noisier. Still good but not excellent as it was in the pas"
"Another mostly excellent stay at the Taj.  Had booked with Virtuoso and so was upgraded to a Club Room upon check-in. This room, on 6th floor, was rather small, but extremely comfortable and cozy, with a nice selection of welcome amenities including fresh flowers and a bottle of house wine.  It is difficult to find any fault with this hotel. Most employees greet you warmly and genuinely seem to take pride in working at the hotel.   Breakfast in Sea Lounge is a delight, although I was disappointed that the after dinner cognac and chocolates, which used to be so pleasant, is now limited to one small shot of VS Cognac and 4 chocolates.   The only other minor issue I faced during my stay was that check out in the Palace wing was rather slow (I have also found this to be the case"
"We were expecting to be in the tower but we’re upgraded to the palace,it was fabulous,the service was second to none the staff were very helpful and friendly,really enjoyed the complimentary afternoon tea,would certainly stay there again."
"My wife and I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel previously and our only complaint was that we didn’t have a long enough stay. This time we stayed an extra two days in Mumbai, following an amazing journey on the Maharajas’ Express train, just to be able to experience the hotel again. We were not disappointed. This is one of the best hotels anywhere: an oasis in the midst of a chaotic, exciting city. Highly recommended. "
hotel is supposed to b the best in mumbai ... and to me this was the best hotel I have been so far..it is on the expensive side ...But it is not just about the luxury but lot to do with the warmth and the human touch that adds to their service. It is definitely worth the prize you pay for. It is an experience that I can't really put in the form of words.... we totally loved it and we are overwhelmed with their levels of standards in service and luxury .. we wish to get back soon
Taj Hotel is one of the best hotel in mumbai. Specially it's inside architecture is very impressive. I have visited Taj 2 times and I feel like I have stepped into the heaven also I want to mention that it is bit expensive hotel
"Had occasion to travel to Mumbai on work (25-29 Oct) and stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace. The stay was absolutely wonderful with the property affording every luxury to the satisfaction of a discerning guest. While such quality is of course synonymous with the Taj group what really set the property apart was the personal touch afforded by every one of the staff.  Not only were they supremely efficient I can vouch that every individual I  had the privilege of interacting with did just that little something to make the stay personal. Whats more, each of them has great pride in the hotel, which speaks volumes of the leadership. This was one stay I will remember for a very long time. My compliments to the management and entire team."
One of the best properties of world. You will feel like a King here. Little bit expensive in comparison to other hotels but nothing in front of a Heritage property like this. Everything is well maintained and well cared.
The iconic Taj Mahal Palace hotel exceeded our expectations. We had a magical 4 nights here and all the staff went above and beyond. I celebrated a special birthday here and the staff made it memorable. I would highly recommend
The welcome was special and personal. Ensuring we were escorted from the moment our car arrived until we were fully settled in our room. Service and attention to details like nothing I have experienced before. The floor butler ensured we wanted for nothing. Only slight negative was the lack of space around the pool for such a large hotel. Make sure to take the tour to learn some Taj history and enjoy afternoon tea in the lounge. Hope to come back one day. 
"For the amount u pay to stay at this hotel compared to Europe or Australia, would make 5star hotels in those countries look like 3 star hotels.   The level of service is out of this world, the staff are always trying to solve your problem within a few minutes. We were checked in by a young women ‘Cyber’ whose level of service was so good you would not think she was still training.   We were there on our honeymoon, when we arrived there was a beautiful chocolate cake, balloons on the bed and flowers on the floor waiting for us which was very nice gesture by the hotel.  The hotel is very busy as it has a lot of history and where the rich of India come to play.   Hotel is in a great location, near India Gate, the museum and has great street shops and street markets.   The hotel has"
"A wonderful oasis of peace, beauty and excellent service in the middle of Mumbai. It is a fine location for walking to the Gate, Museums, market and sea wall. Very helpful people who were so kind! We stayed in the Tower and it was fabulous!!"
"We had a great stay there, we were upgraded and got a VIP treatment.we had a great time there, everything was excellant.the room as well is very beautifull and adding a personal touch makes it super good."
"One understands why the Taj Mahal Palace continues to be the gold standard in hospitality.  For a hotel that has been in existence for so many decades and has so many guests, the décor is impeccable, service is exemplary and food is a gastronomic delight.  I am amazed at how helpful and gracious the staff are.  I have stayed at many hotels in the ""burbs"" recently, mostly international chains, and I must say this is the shining glory of Indian hospitality.  Wah Taj!"
"We visited the Taj for three nights in July, it should have been four, but that's another story. Our first room smelt damp, we did understand that as we were staying in the old building overlooking the Gate Way to India it would be damp. I requested a lovely perfumed candle which burns throughout the hotel instead they upgraded us to a suite. This clearly was a kind thing to do and kind of compensated us having to pay for four nights but only staying for three thanks to BA our flight carrier. Yes you can have free cocktails, but you are watched and judged, nothing like other iconic hotels where the wine flows freely with a laugh from a happy waiter. The service can be over bearing and forced, rather like you are part of a program and they have a script to follow. All the little"
"The best ever experience at the talk mahal palace last year in August. Although I travel often, this hotel is still the one that has kept me smiling at the memory of the experience. All staff stay true to their motto of “an elegance you can feel”"
"Unequaled in Service and hospitality.   From the moment we entered this modern day palace we were blown away by the ambiance, stunning architecture, room appointments and service.   We were booked in sea view room with a spectacular view of the Gate of India.   We were appointed a 24 hr butler who was  attentive to all our needs.  Plush bedding, hig( end toiletries, chocolates, nuts, fruit were always replenished promptly in our room.   Many inclusions such as opulent breakfast, high tea, cocktails and snacks were included with our room.  The pool was a beautiful oasis of tranquility.  Staff at hotel were a exceptional.  On checkout, I mentioned I loved the flower arrangement in the lobby, minutes later an arrangement was sent to my room!"
"Outstanding performance by the taj hotel,  staff exceeded our expectations.  Would definitely visit again. Rooms are clean and everything that was used was replaced daily .location is excellent,  as well as the gateway to india being on the doorstep there are also plenty of shops and restaurants nearby . "
"We stayed in Grand Hyatt hotel for 2 weeks and today we are leaving. The hotel location is very good, near the airport, BKC, Bandra west(many good restaurants). Food is also great especially China House, best Chinese food in town. The Bell Service is the best I ve ever seen. Thanks to Mr. Anant who helped us book the OLA in the busy hour and made the confirmation with the driver(We have difficulty in communicating with the drivers ). Grand Hyatt is definitely our first choice in Mumbai. We will be back in 2 weeks. See you then."
"Its one of the best hotel in india the interiors of this hotel and amazing the food they serve is mouth watering,they really have polite staff and soft spoken,over all a nice experience the hotel lobby is beautiful "
"Nice Hotel. Excellent Service .  Super Service. Nice view from Balcony Gate way of India. Near to Church gate.food is  very Taste & fabulous.nice welcoming & greeting staffs. really Enjoyed a lot.. Thank you so much for Excellent Service,"
"Have stayed here with family on a short vacation. Really enjoyed our  stay, service, food and location Support at arrival was great. Cleanliness at par/better then a five star hotel in US.Food is great "
"We went to The Taj Mahal Palace for our anniversary, up on the arrival after knowing the occasion, they upgrade us to Taj Club Sea View Kind Bedroom. It was such a sweet gesture. They also kept a complimentary cake & bouquet. The view of sea from room is amazing. Enjoyed the staycation."
"If you stay in Mumbai stay at The Taj Mahal Palace. It is costly but so worth it. We had a sea view room in the old palace part. We had fantastic views over the water, the Gateway To India and all the surrounding activity. Lots of activity all day and much of the night yet no noise in the room.  The room was extremely well appointed. Very comfortable. No sign of wear on the interior fabric of the building All staff were so very attentive. Always a smile, a polite greeting and checking if help was required. Breakfast was delightful, a table with a sea view and a great range of food types. We had in-room dining for dinner as we had a very busy day. Delivered by our very helpful butler. Food was great. Tasty Indian style food well presented. Definitely a place to visit."
"Not only is the location beautiful but staying in the palace itself was an outstanding experience . The architecture, views and overall design makes it mesmerising.WhileIt costs 430 dollars per night the extended benefits like access to various Lounges makes it memorable. However the only flaw which is not too big is that the rooms don’t have balcony , but a sea view makes up for this expectation. To summarise it was an excellent experience staying here. if you get lucky then your check out time can get extended by 4-5 hours , least to say. Don’t forget to mention the occasion you are celebrating when staying at taj, as the staff make it really special."
"We had the pleasure to stay at The Taj Palace for two nights 29-30 September 2018. While all staff were friendly and courteous, I would definitely mention the name of Meghana Pitale, the Front Office Executive who stood out among all other staff. A young very competent manager who very confidently and authoritatively showed us to our room and welcomed us warmly. Throughout our stay she made us feel very comfortable and at home, and constantly checked on us if we needed any assistance. Her attitude was so pleasing that we look forward to once again come to The Taj. We wish and pray for her the best in her life, who has so much potential to rise up to a very high position. Thank you Meghana and best regards from all of us. Eskander Sharifi & Family"
The best hotel in Mumbai and maybe in India - please make sure that you book in the old hotel -Palace Wing- which is just amazing. We enjoyed every single minute of our visit. The location just in front of the Gate of India & Colaba Causeway could not be better.
"Perfection. From start to finish. We have never experienced anything like this. The service was so good, it was actually baffling at times how they even managed to do things such as have hot baths, rose petals, foot baths ready for you after your evening meal. We were upgraded without asking for it, which came with many perks. I have never stayed anywhere where they just get everything right. So many little touches that made this the best hotel we have stayed in. We are from england and will gladly fly back in the future, just for this hotel. The level of care is incredible. You really feel that everyone wants you to be there and genuinely care for you. The staff made us truly happy every minute we were there. The room and restaurants were also exceptional. This is now the"
Wah Taj! is truly said. We got chance of staying at Taj  Heritage property. It was beautiful experience. It is so well maintained and the hospitality is outstanding. There were atleast five people to welcome us in the lobby. Check in formalities were done in the room itself. Since it was our anniversary they surprised us by decorating the room with beautiful heart shape balloons and rose petals inside the bathroom and room too. The staff was extremely courteous to talk and they made us so special to take pictures in different angle in the room. They served me best Ginger tea and biscuits on the house as I had a headache due to traveling.  It was lunch time we decided to have at The souk in the tower hotel. The restaurant staff (Ansleem) maybe spelling error took great care of
"We booked the Bay of Bengal cruise with Viking Ocean. Their pre-stay in Mumbai was about $700 per person. Instead, we booked ourselves at the Taj Palace, with butler service. Our room was spacious and lovely, with a perfect view of the Gateway to India and the water, and the little amenities we all want at 5 star hotels were there aplenty. The hotel was built in 1902 (I think...there's a free tour, take it!) so if you want modern, this is not for you. If you love historic, don't miss this. We couldn't figure out what to ask of the butler...but when we returned from our first day of touring, there were hot footbaths for us both, with rose petals! And my husband had left a book next to the bed. They created a bookmark with the book's cover photo. They brought us small gifts and"
"We have stayed at Taj Mahal Palace  in our recent visit to  Mumbai. We were greeted by a Customer relations lady that gave us a Tulsi necklace and put the bindi(a red dot in your forehead) . The room was spacious, very clean and we could see the Gateway of India in front.  The view of the sunrise from our room was beautiful.  This travel was to celebrate our wedding anniversary and they had a lovely surprise prepared. Our room was decorated with red heart shape balloons and rose petals and a cushion with “Happy Anniversary”   embroidered on it   and a cake. We did the ‘Heritage Tour’ that was wonderful. When we went back to our room, was another surprise waiting for us, this time was a lovely silk scarf and bangles from the housekeeping. The service in this hotel in impeccable,"
"It couldn't be better! I enjoyed my stay at the Palace so much. The staff is simply amazing and makes the difference - so kind, corteous, professional, giving me always the feeling of being very welcome. I met  wonderfulf staff like Emmanuel and Karan (Palace Lounge), Navaz (Reception), Rajendra (Harbour Bar) among others...The Club amaneties (like High Tea, Cocktails and Chocolate) were highly appreciated. The transfer back to the airport was stunning, even the assistance with the bag at the airport  by a Taj employee. Excellent! And house keeping and butlers in my room were also wonderful. I loved the details (chocolate, the small presents in the room), keeping the room tidy during the whole day. I also like the food I had in the different restaurants. ONLY ONE THING: My room"
The hotel is quite good the hotel has a great building which is for photo the room is quite neat and clean the service is also very good so you have to book there sweet deluxe room you all love it the room price is not so high but is moderated high you book in your baget they have variety of different price room so enjoy
"Just stayed for the first time at the Taj Mahal Palace and we will definitely be back. We have stayed in a number of Taj hotels throughout India and have enjoyed them all. The level of service was excellent and the Luxury Suite we stayed in was very clean and luxurious with great views to The Gateway To India. All the staff were extremely helpful and I can highly recommend the Club Sandwich by the pool - probably the best I’ve ever eaten.  Not cheap, but a superb hotel to stay at"
"Friendly staff, beautiful rooms, excellent food, awesome views. We enjoyed every second spent in the hotel. Everyone makes you feel special. The breakfast was simply fabulous. The pool area is gorgeous. Every corner is a photo opportunity moment. The Gateway to India was almost within our reach. And teh rooms were five star quality. Will definitely be back for more pampering!"
"Great welcoming. Fresh smell in lobby and rooms.  Friendly staff. They made an upgrades for us when we check in. Fast check in. Luxury rooms. Comfortable bed and soft bed sheet.Nice view on sea. 2 times cleaning per day , supplying fruits , water,  dental , soap, .....  I like the details they care about. Breakfadt lounge in main lobby is spacious had variety if choices. Other lounge  in first floor at the palace is cozy and had a great sea view. Food from outside the hotel are not allowed . Electrical device like toaster, small stove are not allowed for safety purpose. "
"Our experience in the Taj Palace was outstanding. The staff were so attentive and nothing was any trouble, absolutely brilliant. The hotel itself was remarkable so much to see and so beautiful. We were upgraded to the taj palace from the taj tower which we couldn't believe. We would like to say a special Thankyou to Bony and Anselm who went out of their way for us and made our time in the Taj unforgettable. Thankyou so much for having us. Will definitely recommend."
"There is one gem, Taj Mahal in Agra and here is another Taj Mahal, a gem in Mumbai.  Many tried to break spirits of our country and the people associated with Taj Mahal, but come here, and u will realise it didn’t. Great hospitality and experience.  Highlights: 1. Warm reception for the entire family. Felt so important n nice. Loved it.  2. Briefing of the amenities and a friendly walk to the room.  3. Charismatic hotel decor & strong recall of Indian history, culture and tradition. Reminds of how our kings and diplomats used to stay in India’s 1st luxury hotel.  4. Great restaurants with excellent food and finesse in every dish prepared.   Must visit. It’s a landmark hotel and a manifestation of Indian hospitality. "
"We stayed here for three nights in the middle of September – it had long been on our wish list…..and obviously we had to stay in the Palace Wing, rather than the new Tower Wing.  The check-in and welcome was fulsome and detailed. But, after flying overnight from London, it was difficult to take in all the details about the nine (I think) restaurants and other facilities as we were walked to our room.  Our room was large and comfortable and staff were very helpful at every turn. Staff generally have a good (and some a very good) level of English language skills.  Wi-fi was free and provided a good level of service.  Apart from being a destination in its own right, the hotel is close to the Gateway of India and also provides a good base for tours into Mumbai and also to eg"
"Our stay at the Taj Mahal palace was simply put, the best hotel stay I’ve enjoyed in India or anywhere else for that matter.  From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.  From the traditional welcome blessing to the time our room attendant drew us a bath infused with rose petals to the wonderful breakfast buffet, every moment of our stay was spectacular. "
"Staying at the Taj Mahal Palace was so much more than staying in a luxury hotel. ""It was the experience that is India!"" The professionalism, service and warmth of all the staff we encountered was outstanding. Our room was a delight to wake up in and return to. The Taj Mahal Palace itself, a haven of serenity. .Apologies for the delay with completing this survey. We did complete the survey earlier and had thought we'd sent it. Although as there was no confirmation of the survey being sent or received we did wonder if it had in fact been sent. Receiving a reminder to complete the survey confirmed there had been a technical glitch.  We note, there is no ability to save the survey responses as you  progress through it. The one recommendation we wish to make is that your survey"
When you fly to Mumbai  from the states book the room for the day of your travel so when you arrive your room is ready as you will get there around 3 AM on day of arrival.  The reception is tremendous with a true Indian flavor and spiritual experience. The rooms are superb and the restaurants and other services and amenities at the hotel or superior.
"As it was my daughter's first visit to India, my husband and I booked the Taj for our short stay in Mumbai. We were overwhelmed from the moment we walked through the door. Far too many hotels label themselves ""Luxury"" but they are mostly pretenders. With the exception of very few chains (I had the honour of working for one of them for a number of years) and a small number of independent hotels, most do not offer luxury in terms of service, which is what really matters.  Just a few examples:   1) I casually mentioned that I had tasted florentines for the first time nearly 40 yeears ago at the patisserie. Within 10 minutes, a box of florentines, beautiful wrapped in ribbons, was presented to me.   2) Staff at Sea Lounge went out of their way to ensure I was offered various options"
"We stayed from 15/09-17/09, and it was a real good experience.. My husband, son and I stayed there and really enjoyed the historic stories and architecture of the place, together with the great service given to us, which was too good.. Everyone there was so helpful and kind.. one felt they would do anything to make our visit the best ever.. The room and facilities were top notch.. and nothing was lacking..      The hotel surpassed our expectations in service and also the site was exceptional.. Views from the sea lounge were to die for.. Thank you all for a great experience.. "
A vibrant welcome followed by beautiful property is what actually Taj is known for and they did it perfectly. It’s a very old typically Indian beautiful hotel situated in posh south Mumbai known for riches. Hotel is nearby most expensive home in world  known as Antilla which is Home of Richest man in India M.R. Ambani. So you can guess the environment. Staff is very good and cooperative. Food is not good  but  very costly  too compared to other 5 star properties in Mumbai maybe because of location. Gym was not at all equipped well. One best part is that hotel is just opposite  to tourist attraction Gateway of India which is visible from rooms as well.  Overall it was a good stay but for food it’s very bad and need to be worked on by hotel. Hotel is surrounded by many other good
"This is my second time in India. The first time I went, I sweared to myself next time in Mumbai i was gonna stay at the Taj Mahal Palace. Dreams come true. I stayed for three nights at this wonderful piece of history in Mumbai, and Loved it.  When I started planning my trip to India, I knew my first stop would be Mumbai, and I didnñt look anywhere else to stay in town, just like the tittle of the review, I got into ""No other place to stay in Mumbai"" mode. Found the hotel, set the dates and booked it.  I know it is not an Ibis cheap, but it is not what they aim for, they aim for excellence and premium luxurious service, what the hotel charges is just fair, I ""invested"" in my stay, because I expected I would get what I paid for... Well, I got more than I thought, much more.  As"
They are so much enjoying and ancient time such of things are seen that place and so much beautiful scenery are seen that and tajmahal front side are so awesome pond and pic are clicks that side so much awesome picture are click today
"Our fifth visit to this great hotel. The overall experience is palatial. The staff are a real credit to the Taj, the food is exceptionaly good. Certainly will return when we can. A must is to try the special cocktail at the Harbour Exchange bar."
We visited the Taj for the afternoon tea at the Sea Lounge. Do book in advance for the Maharaja Tea and you will feel like one. Very good choice of food. Too much to eat in one go. Very good music from the Pianist and great staff.
"We have just returned from 14 lovely nights at this iconic hotel.  We stayed in a Palace Suite and it was absolutely lovely.  This is a very special hotel, and they pride themselves on excellent service and as a guest it is much appreciated.  Our room was kept immaculately,  and we always enjoy the large pool area.  At the moment the gym is being refurbished, but I am sure when this has been completed it will be well patronised.  Thank you Taj for another memorable stay.I hav"
"Staying at this place is truly amazing and a treat for the senses!!!Every nook and corner is remarkably studded and decorated with various artifacts and exquisite works of Art.Needless to say, the hospitality is indeed world class as expected at any premium Taj property.Thank you Team Taj Mahal for making this stay truly remarkable and worth cherishing!!!!Kudos..!!!"
"Great service, specially in the restaurant. The chef was incredibly helpul and ensure that my vegetarian breakfast was always ready!  The rooms are decorated very luxuriously and there is always a lot of help around the lobby. Great location for business  I recommend it"
"i have been travelling all around the world and stayed in many different hotels but tja Room is very clean, The staff were friendly and helpful, very attractive treatment, was great place to visit it recommended"
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Taj Highly recommended. The staff were friendly and helpful. Clean big rooms and great food :) the location was ideal and very easy to get transport to the rest of the city.
"On 1st October me and my friends go to tajmahal and it was great place to visit  The tale of love and loss that supposedly sparked the existence of the Taj Mahal (literally, the ""Crown Palace"") sometimes seems as incredible as the monument's beauty. It is said that Shah Jahan fell in love with his favorite wife, Arjuman Banu, at first sight, and went on to revere her for her generosity, intelligence, and the 14 children she bore. She became his Mumtaz Mahal (the Exalted of the Palace), and her love for him was apparently just as great—on her deathbed, or so the legend goes, she begged the king to build a monument so beautiful that the world would never forget their love. Five months later, a huge procession brought Mumtaz Mahal's body to Agra, where Shah Jahan began the process"
"We have been travelling all around the world and stayed in many different hotels. We were therefor very excited about The Taj Mahal Palace. Is it as good as people are writing. The answer is YES. Be booked a nice room in the Palace wing with the view to the sea. The service in the hotel is very good even if there is a lot of people staying in the hotel. The staff in the lounge, breakfast room, the restaurant close to the swimming pool, SPA etc. did a very good job. When you arrive in the main entrance, it was very busy and a lot of people, but if you go to the next reception in the Palace wing you got even a better service. The house keeping did also a good job. Very clean room.  Gave us special service every day. I really wanted to buy the bed sheets because this is one of the"
"Staying at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai is entering in history but also enjoying all the comfort, service and luxury of today. Elegant rooms, amazing breakfast and restaurants with food from around the world, incredible spa and fantastic swimming pool."
"One night at this iconic hotel; felt the greatness of this iconic structure palace, excellent customer services, luxury rooms and delicious foods, it's truly above any modren standards to compare with any other hotels in India. Everything was amazing, no more words to describe this experience, thanks a lot Taj team for this wonderful experience."
"Stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for three nights with my family. From the minute we were welcomed in, the staff were warm and courteous and were always all smiles.  We stayed in the palace in the fifth floor. The rooms are large and filled with gorgeous art. The view of the Gateway of India was absolutely breathtaking. The washroom was luxurious with a very nice bathtub and shower. The beds were extremely comfortable and they had a lovely selection of tea and other toiletries to make our stay very pleasant. There were gorgeous fresh flowers in our room always and were so nice to wake up to. I even visited the gym, which was very nicely equipped with all you’d need  plus they had a nice selection of refreshing wild waters to top it all off.   The breakfast spread was enormous and"
"We had taken the Gateway View room . The view was simply excellent , especially since it was all decked up for 26th January.  The breakfast was really good. Their swimming pool is amazing. It is well shaded hence you can enjoy your swim anytime of the day."
"The palace wing has a very traditional decor. The cleanliness and amenities are the best that you can expect.  The staff is amazingly helpful and very polite. The lobby is beautiful! The swimming pool is large and well maintained. It is an osasis removed from all the Mumbai madness , while , being at the center of it all! The breakfast buffet has an amazing selection. Their ""Baked Yogurt"" for breakfast is hevenly!"
"An experience that I highly recommend for those who really are passionate of luxury hotels is my stay at TajMahal Palace in Mumbai. This splendid historic architectural masterpiece, symbol of the city, is not only a destination hotel with a stunning atmosphere, but also offers a unique hospitality experience in the best location of the city. The standard of cleanliness and service were beyond any expectations. Apart from the luxurious, well equipped, spacious rooms of classy style, I was amazed by the staff ‘s royal treat and exceptional service. They were are all so professional and attentive to every need. As far as the restaurants concerns, there were many choices of high quality and the food was beyond good."
"I guess there is nothing much to stay, it is a must to stay and live the Taj Mahal experience, fantastic voyage from A to Z! Congratulations to you all for your kindness and commitment, you can be proud."
"Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai what an delightful experience. I had the most amazing time here, I cannot fault anything here. Breakfast was out of this world, room service, food and staff are top class.   I loved how I would come to my room in the evening and find little treats and notes. The hotel's interior and architecture is immaculate. I would like to highly reccomend everyone to experience a stay here. Room view was great for me as requested overlooking The Gateway of India and beautiful sea. "
"Mumbai is a crazy city. The Taj however is the perfect oasis to come back to after venturing out into mad Mumbai. The lobby is spacious and opulent with fresh flower arrangement that smell divine. Our room over looked The Gate of India and we enjoyed watching the busy crowds visiting the monument from above. The service here is impeccable, with the staff quick to help and respond at anytime. The Taj was an absolute haven for us and is definitely one of the nicer hotels I’ve stayed at. Also a quick mention to the pool, it was lovely swimming and at the same time admiring the beautiful colonial building surrounding the pool area. We had a memorable stay."
"Stayed from 28th September to 30th September in Taj Towers. Right from arrival till check out the courtesy extended by Hotel staff is beyond expression. Hotel ambience, quality of food, Service and special attention made the stay memorable. It is five star hotel and true to the group pedigree standards, hotel lived up to in treatment to its guests. Would like to recommend strongly. "
My Taj Experience was Awesome with its level of Service and Quality. From Check in to Checkout all had been taken care without a word to say. Rooms were Spacious and Staff will go to next level to help you out with anything and everything you need.
"Received warm welcome from staff at the time of arrival, staff also guided for the amenities present in hotel. Cleanliness & fragrances are good enough to make your mood fresh. Best services touches your heart.Wah Taj..."
"My major problem with this is they are charging 300irp per person and you are not allowed to stay after sunset. The sun hadn't offically set and guards (with sticks) were telling people to get down from the wall and leave.   I felt this was unfair as I was there to enjoy a sunset over the river to absorb being around a world famous palace.   If it wasn't for the guards ushering people out it would be a 5 star review.  Also, just like the Taj Mahal itself,  no tripods security checks."
"I stayed in taj palace tower , good location , nice and clean  hotel and welcome staff , staring from the front desk in the lobby , waiters in the resturant , housekeeping and even the porter , all of helped you with smily faces ..   sure will come back again .  "
Hotels have come and gone but the Taj Mahal hotel in Appolo Colaba is the greatest. It is owned by the icons c house of Tata.it has a historical princely old heritage hotel and other modern building Taj Annex. One of the best socialite clients and famous bars like Harbour bar and Chinese restaurant best in Mumbai and the Zodiac bar. If you really want 5 star luxury and service Taj is best even in location.
"Great hotel with outstanding service. Very welcoming and nice staff, good meeting facilities. Very grand floors (Tower) and inviting lounge facilities. Thanks to the entire team, I will certainly come back."
We booked 2 deluxe rooms for stayacation package in the last week of September. The rooms are lovely with the gorgeous view of gateway of India and the ocean. The rooms had everything anyone would require for a comfortable stay. We chose Masala Kraft which is the Indian specialty restaurant for dinner. The Manager Anant and Captain Shoaib ensures that we have a memorable time. Shoaib suggested the best items on the menu. Service was superb with all details taken care of. Really nice to see that the iconic Taj Mahal retains its take on luxury and hospitality. Well done and keep it up. Thanks for making our holiday enjoyable
I stayed here with my wife for one day on a stacation pacakge. The entire experience was amazing. The breakfast at Sea Lounge and the lunch at the Souk were the highlights of the stay. You can also take the evening guided tour of the palace which starts from near the Swimming Pool. 
The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai still has the charm it had when it all began. I  visited the hotel after a gap of many years but fell in love with it all over again in spite of many new properties in town. The rooms are spacious and the service unmatched.
"We arrived early am  and were ushered straight to our room with the warmest of indian welcoming's.  A Spacious grand room with excellent amenities.  Sea facing view of the harbour and gateway of india was a visual delight from the 4th floor we were staying. All staff in all areas excelled in welcoming an anticipating our needs and preferences. Don't miss out on the daily heritage walk and high tea at the sea lounge and a drink at the harbour bar. Breakfast at the sea lounge was one of the nicest experiences to date.  The lighting of the divas  by the staff around the palace is a great watch too. ""Get a stay at the palace on your bucket list when in mumbai,   Can't wait to stay again when in mumbai.   keep us the good work Taj "
"I recently returned to the Taj after thoroughly enjoying my stay there last year. My room overlooking the sea and the Gateway to India was just as I remembered it - quiet, peaceful and luxurious. I often find it hard to sleep when traveling but not at the Taj as the bed was extremely comfortable and I was able to get a good night's rest. Service was once again superb, with nothing being too much trouble for the staff. I appreciated the little treats that appeared in the room each day as well as the friendly service in the Shamiana cafe. Special thanks to Beauty for remembering my favourite table and how I like my coffee and to butlers Vinod and Dylan for all of their help. I look forward to a third visit."
"Room was amazing, food was even better. I was dumbfounded with the royalness of the hotel. The service is top notch and the staff very courteous. They welcome you warmly and the whole experience begins just as you arrive at the hotel."
"The hotel and its staff and service exceeded our expectations all together. It was a visit we will always remember and cherish. The service we received during our three day stay was amazing to say the least. We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast at sea lounge in the palace wing. The swimming pool and all the facilities available in the hotel were very enjoyable. My husband, daughter and I cannot wait to visit again. "
"Where to start? The place is just too beautiful and grand! Excellent service, nice smelling lobby and wonderful staff.  Restaurants can get jampacked on weekends so be sure to make a reservations - unfortunately, we were not reminded of this on our arrival so on our last night we were not able to try out the Souk resto.  But all in all absolutely amazing place!"
We celebrated our honeymoon here and from the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed and made to feel special. All the staff were very friendly and attentive and we were treated like royalty. We were amazed with all the extra touches we were given and our honeymoon was a truly memorable one! Thank you everyone at this beautiful and special hotel!  
"Beautiful hotel, great location, what is not to love? Stunning lobby, excellent service, very nice and comfortable rooms, shops inside and out, spa. Was a great experience. Fine hotel. Took a boat from right outside the front door to go exploring."
"We, at the TAJ MAHAL PALACE, had the most memorable experience. The Receptionist, Ms. Sayonika Das escorted us to our room and to my surprise, the beautifully arranged room was made to look more beautiful as it was fully decorated for my birthday. We were introduced to our Butler, Mr. Pritesh Hindalekar. The hotel offered us with a complimentary High Tea Buffet. We were invited for the tour of Palace & Sun Set ritual. Our second Butler Mr. Ashish Bidlan invited us to see the Rajput Suite. To my utter surprise, as we entered the Suite, the hotel staff arranged a surprise cake cutting ceremony. We were suggested to have Rose petal ice cream at the restaurant situated on the 20th floor of the Taj Tower which not only tasted delicious but also was best ice cream ever. We enjoyed"
I am staying at the Taj and I booked the airport pick-up service. The car was not there when my flight arrived and I had to take a taxi without knowing the best option. Now the hotel wants to charge me for the service they did not provide.
"For my wife’s birthday, I wanted to take her someplace VERY SPECIAL! We chose a weekend stay at the Taj Club Floor in a sea-facing room in the Heritage Wing. Was it the ultimate? Yes indeed.  THE ULTIMATE in Class, Luxury, Charm, Hospitality & Warmth....truly Taj style! Having worked for the Tatas earlier in my career, I’m sure this precisely is what JRD ( our Legendary former Chairman) would’ve aspired for & how very satisfying to see the Taj banner flying at the very top after all these years. Well done & thank you, everyone working at the Taj!"
"Great iconic hotel. Welcome at the hotel with traditional tilak and Tulsi mala is touching. Best of standards of Taj, as far as stay is concerned. Meals sumptuous and breakfast healthy- huge variety. Lifetime experience. I would give 9/10."
"Spend 3 days here for business and afterpary. Great experience and excellent serice. Accomodation was beyond expextation and to be recommended. Not for from the Hotel one can visit the famous Gate , nice reataurants and nice shops. "
"Another excellent stay at the Taj, this time in the tower wing which didn't disappoint.  It had the best view of the sea, the gate and the palace wing.  The room had everything we could need and house keeping kept surprising us with things you wouldn't expect, lovely facial scrubs, bookmarks if they noticed a book in our room, glasses cloth put with or glasses,  just simple gestures that made us smile each day. The room was decorated for our anniversary,  another gesture that made the stay romantic for us, they did well! We appreciated all of these touches. We were looked after each morning at breakfast by Magalhaes, he knew what we wanted each day and even provided dishes we wouldn't usually try, a very nice man with only our interests in mind.  During breakfast Rahul explained"
"Well what can I say about this lovely hotel, great service from the time you enter the door till you depart with a heavy heart . We were given a refurbished sea facing room on the 6th floor, lovely with modern fittings, great view of the Gateway of India. It was nice meeting Satish Gaikwad my old Shamiana colleague and a few other staff I worked with many years ago. Breakfast great spread as always..service with a smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes"
"Since the time from check in, you will start feeling like a ""Royals"". They have a detail for everything. The true legacy of Indian Hospitality is carried by them which is clearly  reflecting in their service. There will be always someone who is willing to serve you with an amazing smile.I got no words to describe them. I can't wait to stay here again."
nice as well as intresting place these is. iam going to tjhere  sio many time .i love on these place. amazing place i saw in my life a lot change happened when i saw these place . now next holiday i arranged trip to these place
Wonderful stay at this iconic property which has a history and legacy attached.Rooms and services offerings were spot on.With a multitude of options in cuisine wish the stay could have been longer to experience it all.32 names edged on the wall of life lost during the terror attack is thoughtful and makes one emotional too.positively will revisit.
"The Taj Mahal Hotel made us feel like the King and the Queen. They pampered us and spoilt us in luxury. They took care of every minutest details and requirements, went out of the way to accommodate our requests.  Very warm and luxurious hospitality that will be remembered forever."
"I don't know what to say other than, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!  The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is extraordinarily beautiful.  Every detail has been carefully and copiously attended to.  The hallways leading to the rooms feel like you're in the most exquisite art gallery as the halls are lined with paintings and sculptures and beautiful green plants.  The lobby is simply breathtaking.  From the moment you walk in, you feel like you've made the smartest choice of hotel you've ever made.  The flower arrangements alone would be worth staying here for--they're so sumptuous and beautiful.  The pool are is breathtakingly beautiful.  The breakfast room (The Sea Lounge) looks like a set from the series, The Crown.  The staff could NOT be lovelier and/or more helpful if it tried.  But you"
"The service we received during our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace was world-class. From our butlers, who took care of our every need (including restaurant reservations, shoe repairs and luggage repairs) to our room steward Nittin, who made our stay perfect with his attention to details, foot baths and room decor...everything was perfect. The breakfast and evening drink service in the Sea Lounge was also exceptional. Only one area for improvement: the room often felt a little damp and smelled a bit musty. While the AC worked great, it wasn't able to eliminate the dampness and the musty smell from the room. For a five star hotel, this would be an area to improve. When we return to Mumbai, we look forward to our return to the Taj Mahal Palace. "
"We spent a day in this hotel and wish we stayed longer!!! Located on the harbor front and in the heart of Gateway of India, this hotel in fully renovated and absolutely breathtaking.  From it’s lobby to rooms to court yard to its restaurants, food, coffee shops and shops of beautiful jewelry, this hotel has it all.  I cannot express in words how beautiful this hotel is.  As you step out, you are in the main hustle bustle of Mumbai and it’s people.  The shops and restaurants around are in plenty and diverse as India is with its people and culture!!!! Love , love love this hotel!!!!"
"No doubt it is an impressive building, dripping in history and in a great location. It is clean and in the whole well maintained. The rooms are quite nicely furnished and very clean. BUT any, absolutely any, request of the staff sets in motion a frustrating and comical farce and you simply regret asking. Where this is most rediculous is breakfast which, if you didn’t resign yourself to enjoying the humour in it you would become quite vexed. It’s unfair to single breakfast out however as each if the outlets we used provided a really poor experience. Amongst this there are some very very charming staff, but this is because they are charming people. Otherwise it is a complacent hotel, that absolutely takes its guests for granted, without any evidence of leadership and appears to be"
"This is certainly my all time favourite Hotel in the world!!! When you book insist on booking in the palace wing. They spoil you to the core. Paying that extra bit for the sea facing rooms is worth it.  Right from the architecture to the recent history attached the hotel makes it a very unique experience. They offer a whole lot of added features in the room rate which is fantastic. The complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits at the Palace Lounge 24 hours (take care you don't violate the dress code)  The high tea Evening cocktail and snacks hour Nightcap! To top all this they have excellent onsite Restaurants and a good pool as well as the regular amenities. I would strongly suggest that after you do the touristy stuff of visiting Agra, Jaipur etc,,, go to Mumbai, stay at the Taj"
"We were confirmed for a twin bed but we were given a queen size bed instead upon arrival. We got moved to a king bed room with the extra bed. The staff were friendly, breakfast at the sea lounge is good."
amazing property Taj is Taj what a view what a lobby extremely fabulous interior wow ambience i had a great time i would like to visit for a stay soon i just came for a meeting though in the lobby staff greeted me well. 
"I booked 7 rooms in Taj Mahal Tower for my son first birthday celebration on 6 sept 2018. When we entered in hotel a very warm welcome by hotel staff with tradition indian style with arti thali. When hotel staff come to know that we are coming for our son’s first birthday, they start giving us surprise first they upgrade our all room to Taj Mahal Palace.  In night when we go out  for dinner they surprised us again they decorate our room with red carpet, rose petals, balloons and soft toys in the room. They also arrange a special beautiful cake .  They make the day more special and what i say about staff no words, they are superb nice behaviour by everyone.  And special thanks to Mrs.. ( Director- Rooms) sorry i forget her name but she arrange everything very nicely and feel us"
I was availing my Innercircle free night and was upgraded to a Palace Wing room. Its a supper luxury to stay in the Iconic Palace Wing. I enjoyed my stay to the fullest and staff was very responsive at all levels.
"what a design that this hotel had all the staff were so friendly and our double room was so clean with all the offer , they were speak English very well that helped us to knew were should we went there and realized some history about around"
We enjoyed two nights on arrival to India from a long flight from Australia. The staff were so helpful in checking us in and showing us the facilities of the room which was extremely comfortable. The breakfast buffet was very varied and an excellent introduction into Indian cuisine as well as European . The Souk restaurant has a fabulous view especially looking down at the Gateway of India. A wonderful start to our holiday.
"Nowhere on Earth does hospitality like India. We were treated like Queens on our honeymoon when we stayed here Sept 2018. The hotel is magnificent and clean. The pool area and our room were a dream. Sayonika Das went above and beyond to ensure that we had a special time at this hotel. They decorated our room with hearts, balloons, rose petals, a delicious cake and so much more. Sayonika’s enthusiasm, gifts, and grace are something we will never forget."
Amazing hotel. Indian food for our breakfast at Shamiana and Sea lounge were great. FB staffs were amazing. And wonderful turn down from housekeeping. The hotel itself is very beautiful. Ms. Natacha the hotel GSA and the concierge staffs educated us for the hotel history and the Mumbai history. Best Spa and lovely Artist corner. Beautiful Pool.  It is best wonderful first time in India. 
"Cutomer service awsome, free wifi,foods are very tasty room service is good very neat and clean. Management is awsome, free calling. Very attractive place we can also meet some of the celebrities over there."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a magnificent structure and magnificent place to stay I'm sure. We had to settle for a nice window seat high above and over-looking the Gateway of India monument. We were seated graciously by the female Maitre 'D (?) who recognised us after the first day and took us to 'our' table. Two kindly waiters remembered my predeliction for ice buckets and cold beer and simply acted on my nod to bring our drinks. My wife chose either a cocktail or G&T, overall it was a sublime experience. NO, we were not rich, yet we felt like we were being treated as if we were, a weird but gratifying foray into another world. One could imagine echoes of the British Raj life at this famous hotel. Try not to cheapskate as we had to, it's a fabulous journey. I have not rated either"
"Spent three nights at Taj Palace, again in the old wing, and this time I can give full points.  Check-in: smooth, fast, friendly, efficient Room: right wing, facing inwards to the pool (as I always prefer as the side facing the gateway of India it far too noisy). King Size Bed, large Flat TV, separate desk, coffee maker, large bathroom - no complaints.It´s still the old style of a bathroom - good size, marble everywhere, old fashioned sanitary fittings - but everything worked.  WIFI: worked well, although I had to book the premium version for reasons of speed.  Service: enjoyed breakfast in the Old Wing Breakfast room (included) and always had a drink at late evening downstairs at the pool area. Service absolutely perfect, though at a price. Checking-out: again fast and"
The Taj Mahal palace is the epitome of glamour and sophistication. Situated at the heart of the Mumbai the hotel is one of the best choices to the foreign travelers as well as to the people who love to entertain themselves with fineness. I have visited Taj for a business purpose and will always remember my experience. 
"Stayed at the Taj Palace, Mumbai to celebrate my son’s birthday. We were charmed by the hospitality and excellent guest relations they follow. On knowing it was our son’s birthday, they decorated the room with Balloons & flowers and sent him a cake – all complimentary. Staff are well trained, courteous and helpful. Superior customer service, comfort and luxury make staying at this place worthwhile. Right from the time you check in (traditional welcome with garland), you are treated like royalty. We were escorted to our rooms and features explained. Spacious, well maintained rooms with balconies overlooking the city or sea. We were lucky to get rooms overlooking the Gateway of India and it’s a sight to behold both at sunrise and after sunset. The housekeeping staff are friendly"
"We initially booked the The Taj Mahal Tower but were upgraded here since it was our honeymoon. It was absolutely unbelievable, they had planned everything to make these days unforgettable for us. The service is superb. We have absolutely no complaints. We highly recommend.  Thanks to everyone in the Taj Mahal for making our stay in Mumbai so pleasant."
"Taj mahal palace mumbai is amazing,classic collection of luxury at his best.money spent on hotel in staying is worthiness.  Bathroom is really royal type.high quality marble. I stayed in exucutive suite citi view on 2 sep 2018 .iam thankful to taj hotel director of sales for giving me a very good suite room at best deal.  Iam saluting taj mahal palace gm mr taljinder singh for maintaining this hotel.His hardwork giving the very good results for this hotel.  With Regards, Rajesh sharma."
"We stayed in this property for four days, which was a part of my official tour. Me and my husband are utterly impressed by their impeccable service. Ms. Harshal is a name which we will always remember whenever we'll think of Taj. She is the Taj of the Hotel. Her excellent service, impressive hospitality and superb delivery really left us speechless. We received an upgrade, which enabled us to have an awesome experience, with our room facing the magnificent India Gate. Our every morning at Taj began with the majestic view of the great historic monument, breakfast spread was superb. Each and every staff greeted us with a soulful smile, it was a blissful feeling. Their hospitality is one of the best in the world I would say!  Starting from the reception till the end, we've had a"
Stayed in the tower but paid the extra for a sea view well worth it and didn’t disappoint. Lots of little extras with this hotel. Pool was great for relaxing and swimming. Great location in Colaba and lots of dining options on site or short stroll to shopping or restaurants  
"Thankyou Milind to make this happen. Taj inner circle booking. Ritika at the reception at the time  of check in was v. helpful n  made a smooth,fast one. We were Ecsorted to the room. She was so sweet n friendly. The Taj hospitality is gr8. The welcome drink was refreshing after a long drive. The room is elegant n stylish. All amenities are available. Pillow of our choice was provided. The staff are helpful, friendly. A nice evening at the bar followed by food at the room. The food is good.  Just that the veg. Biryani was little disappointing. Overall a gr8 stay. Had fun chilled out... "
"We stayed here both at the beginning and end of a one-month trip to India. The first stay was in the tower, the second in the main building. Both time we opted for a sea view. The tower is good value but the main building is worth the extra cost if you can afford it. Overall this is a stunning hotel with fantastic service all over - nothing is too much for them. all the restaurants are great. The indian food on the breakfast buffet will introduce you to the most amazing selection of india dishes. The location is great, right by the sea. it is also perfectly safe and fascinating to walk round the surrounding area. One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in spend the money!"
"Taj Mahal Palace, opposite Gateway of India is world renowned as one of the best luxury hotels in the world. Great property, every bit of the place is luxurious from common areas to rest rooms. Staff & service is top notch, you can't find anything to complain about. I have always enjoyed my stay here. Based on my experience, I believe that this property is more suited for business visits, and not so much for family visits, as there is not a lot your kids will be able to do other than spend time in swimming pool. Overall, its a great place for a luxurious weekend outing."
"The whole experience of staying the in Palace rooms was cosseting, luxurious and pampering from arrival to check-out. The highlight is the quality of the staff - caring, helpful, interested and polite. It is not cheap, but is so worth it. We had a package that included breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks in the Sea Lounge - this made the stay!"
"Been there many times, and they always provide amazing service, excellent hospitality and would advise anyone to stay there if they want to experience true indian hospitality at its best. Always enjoy having drinks by the pool after a day out in this hectic city.  Cannot wait to be back there again."
"Agra is very beautiful place. And theair story of badsha shajaha and theair begam thear is is beautiful story and culture .i was like thes beause theair besign its so awosome,it is so nice place in world."
"Imagine you're in an Agatha Christies's movie...those were words like elegant, exquisite and fascinate are the base lines.  And the icing on the cake, the amazing and embracing people of this country where ""people smile properly"" with their heart.."
"As usual the services were excellent, food was great. The smiling sent off by ever charming Natasha from front front desk energized enough to relish the journey back to Gurgaon.I could not avail/enjoy much of services this time as stay was cut short due to Rakhsha Bandhan festival. Trying to come back this week, GOD willing.I did miss a lot Taronish, Urmi and specially Rahil in this stay."
"Many hidden fees in this hotel. We were charged 70% more than the original pice we were shown for this hotel, at checkout. The bathtub was infected with fungus. We asked for an extra bed, and they gave us a moldy, worn out, filthy and broken bed to sleep on. Refer to pictures"
"We had one of the best stay at The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai. Felt like we stayed in a palace-the paintings, the period furniture and everything about this hotel is classy, beautiful and oh-so-elegant. We stayed at the palace wing of the hotel. Our room was fantastic with a comfortable bed and the small balcony offered a lovely view. The room was spacious and so was the bathroom. It had all the top notch amenities. The hotel had some of the finest restaurants in the city offering various cuisine. We also used their amazing swimming pool, spa and gym.  I have to specially mention about their service and hospitality as it was outstanding. Each and every member of their staff were helpful and friendly. We had an unforgettable stay and can’t wait to stay there again."
"3 hours wait to get a table for dinner and discourteous staff at evening tea lounge. Overall not a good experience. Compared to same service brands in Mumbai, the hospitality seemed to be suffering from delusion of grandeur! The only plus point being is location and hype."
"I had an excellent and memorable stay at Taj Mahal hotel. Punctual staff with great service focus and attitude to delight guests, ambience, wonderful food coupled with amenities made my stay enjoyable."
"We visited the Taj after watching a documentary aired by the BBC. Our stay was for two nights, upon entering the hotels grounds all staff treat you in a great manner. We were upgraded to another room which was a nice surprise.  The place as per its name is really a palace!  We were not short of choice for breakfast, the rooms although small were impeccable, from the interior to the bathrooms. What really stood out at Taj is the professionalism of the staff, unfortunately many places in India provide service based on their guests colour and status this is not the case here. Each guest seemed to be treated with great respect."
"The hotel is awesome, ambiance is great and totally reflecting the gorgeous taj legacy. We went for dinner and it was delicious. Totally in love with the interior and the flowers in the lobby were so fresh."
Absolutely flawless. This is not a hotel but rather a work of art. An amazing stay. You will not be disappointed . From the beautiful breakfast to the amazing wine selection for dinner to the access to the great shopping. This is a must
"Stayed here again after an absence of a few years. Had rooms this time in both the Tower and Palace wings. Location in Colaba is becoming a drawback as many businesses have moved to other parts of the city and commuting in Mumbai’s heavy traffic is a real pain. The Tower wing rooms are more modern and seem to have been recently refurbished. But what the Palace wing rooms lack in modernization, they amply make up for in sphere and history. Breakfast is very good with a large choice and excellent service. Staff everywhere helpful and friendly as befits the place.  Had meetings in the (I think) members only The Chambers in the Tower wing. Excellent facilities. Also lunch and early evening drinks there very good.  Had dinner once at the  Masala Kraft but must say that I wasn’t"
"It’s been 10 years since I last visited Taj Mahal in Mumbai, or Bombay as older generation lovingly calls the city. I was very much looking forward to my stay as pleasant memories of the past visit rushed through my mind.  There was another reason for my excitement. The hotel underwent a major renovation with introduction of new art, furniture and décor.  Being an experienced traveller I opted for an airport pick-up service organized by Taj. A friendly chauffer greeted me right after customs, and with my luggage in one hand he politely waived in the direction to parking with another. My transfer car featured free WiFi, chilled mineral water, candies and refreshing wet towels. Half an hour later we entered through the gate heading to the luggage screening.   The first glance put"
This is my visit to the city after 22 years. The Taj Mahal Hotel is one of the best hotels in the world. Very good room service Excellent bathroom clean and when there is any note is the attention and follow up the observation professionally and accurate restaurants in the hotel delicious and large and elegant and different tastes and varieties and also security are very concerned with security procedures feeling safe inside the hotel above the perception of you feel The comfort and safety of all the facilities and the delay of the hotel Staff wonderful smile Do not leave the youngest employee to the largest employee sense Warming feelings and that you are in your home Thank you all working at the restaurant at the top of sophistication and morality and humility and spaciousness
I’ve never been so excited to review any hotel as much as I’ve been to review the Taj Mahal Mumbai it’s been a fab stay and I must say a great experience. I along with my mother just came for 01 night to spend my birthday and it’s been one off my best birthdays...from the welcome to the Taj and then to the welcome drink at the Apollo lounge and then the speedo check in by the representative and then the orientation all the way to my room by Harshali was an amazing experience for me and my mom...when we entered the room it was all decorated with balloons as it was my birthday and then the upgrade of the room along with a fab gesture by the housekeeping staff a gift from there end and a cake from the Taj...room was exceptionally clean and quite big for 02-03 pax bathroom was also
"Given the price I hap paid online using hotels.com i was expecting a true flawless experience.  Wrong!  The pictures will prove the horror we had to put up with at $500 per night!  The checkout staff absolutely cynical and polite as they enforce on you the pricey errors of their own system!  I was staying there 2 nights and made my reservation online.  After one day I wrote to the hotel to advise them we were going to be 2 kids and an adult, instead of one kid and an adult, and asked them to let me know if I should cancel the online reservation and redo it, or if they could do it directly, expecting them to respect the online price!  I also asked for a room with a view of the Gateway of India (also expecting them to respect the online price difference of US$30 per night!).  What"
"Enjoyed a 2 night stay at the Taj. Overall great hotel, not quite as modern as I am use to, but very well appointed rooms, and nice service. High security at the entrance to hotel probably not a bad idea considering the tragic history at this hotel. "
"I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel.  Our flight from Dubai landed at 2:30 AM in Mumbai and I was worried that someone may not be there to greet us.  As soon as we exited baggage claim there was a very nice gentleman waiting for us.  Check in was smooth ( we paid for the night before so our room would be ready).  As American Express cardholders we were upgraded to a beautiful suite that overlooked the sea and the Gateway of India.  The room was beautifully appointed, the bed very comfortable and we were in a very quiet part of the hotel.    As you can imagine we were jet lagged so we didn't venture very far from the hotel the first day we were there.  We ate lunch, dinner and breakfast at 3AM the following morning at the hotel. I think we ate at 2-3 of the"
"Can't stress this enough: Go early!! It gets super crowded the further in the day you go. We went with our tour guide around 5:30 and there was already a number of people there so we still had to wait to get in position for the photo I posted here.   I may be acting like a diva here but we were surprised at how the inside of the Taj Mahal wasn't super exciting. A lot of temples have gorgeous insides, but this was mostly just the tomb, which makes sense I guess due to the purpose of the building anyways..."
"The Hotel Is built as such that most of the rooms face the Sea Shore. The Service staff is simply amazing, they are ready to serve you even at the latest hour of the night and the early Dawn of the morning. All the amenities which you require are fulfilled. one must surely visit the Jiva spa it's Quite Amazing."
While maintaining the old World charm the rooms have been renovated to a high standard. We were in a spacious room with a small balcony overlooking the Gateway of India. Th swimming pool area is nice and buzzing. The staff overall were impeccable. Enjoyed the food at the Souk and the snacks by the poolside.The Jiva Spa is very luxurious and the massage was good.
"Courteous staff and nice atmosphere. The only particular thing was that we couldnt keep the window open and the view was also not that good. After paying 23,000 for one night stay, the view should have been phenomenal."
"The moment we enter to hotel that was itself an experience,the way team welcomes you the way we were greeted its was with full of wormth.the time.the time we enter to golden Dragon it was an great service with great team especially Jason and Sunil,I would say I had never had this great experience ever with any hotels."
"We soend a vouple of luxurious nights after a month of guesthouses. The hotel is beautiful, room is very well equipped. Don't miss the breakfast which was full of taste. Most of all, service was beyond words even towards a family of hobos like us .. "
"This historical hotel of Mumbaï have the best high-tea of the city.. and probably ever!  Their suggestion will make you travel: from indian delicatessen to traditionnal european sandwichs.  Of course, the choice and the quality of the teas are just memorable!  "
"The motivation behind our dream of staying a night at the Taj Mahal Palace was not just to experience the opulence and the legendary hospitality; but also to see the famed art-works of the Modern Indian masters. The Tatas (Taj Hotels belongs to the Tata group, for those who were not aware) are renowned art-collectors; which puts them in a class distinctly different from the Ambanis and the Adanis and the Kharcha-Rupaiyyas.  The corridors of the hotel thrive with art; not just paintings but sculptures and exquisite antiques. There is no specific order in which the collection is displayed-so you have to be on your guard all the time-who knows when you’ll walk into a Raza or a Paresh Maity sculpture or an intricate oil-lamp holder from the 18th century. It happened to us after"
The best hitel!! We stayed at the hotel last weeh (August 2018) . The hotel is breathtaking. the rooms are beutiful the stuff is great ang willing to help on  any request. We stayed at the palace and loved it. Dont miss eating in the Masala restaurant the food there is great and the stuff is great. 
"Everything was lovely, the food, the view, the service.. Definitely one of the best 5 stars of mumbai.. The lebanese restaurant called Souk is my favourite.. the food is mind blowing, a must try experience"
"Ideally located in the south of the city, this hotel is the place to be in Mumbai. High quality, excellent service, you will be close to the main touristic places. I would definitely go back to this place for my next trip in Mumbai."
"Now this is one place where you must stay.   I had booked into the Towers and was upgraded to a Sea View room during Check In. The check in was very efficiently handled by Ms Meghna. The room was lovely, spacious and with a comfortable washroom. The view of the Gateway was to die for.   Though I missed the Heritage tour, I believe that's something worth taking.   I had my breakfast at the Sea Lounge in the Heritage Wing and that was another amazing experience. This was recommended during my check in and is something I would definitely like to do again. It's a smaller area so do go early and the extremely hospitable staff ( I was served by a very sweet Mr Emraan) will ensure that you have a breakfast to remember.  I used the laundry services and it was efficient and punctual. I"
"Probably the most exciting thing about staying here of course is how impressive it is historically.  You'll enjoy seeing all of the pictures of the famous celebrities who have stayed there--you can even see where Barrack Obama signed the guest book!  And the building and rooms are of course just gorgeous!!!  But the thing that impressed me the most about the hotel was the service!!  Of course the room service is impeccable, but what was really memorable is when we were eating breakfast and my husband slightly coughed and the waiters came running over with a special hot drink that they thought could help.  And then later when I sneezed, even though I had a Kleenex one of the waiters ran over with a whole box of them!!  I knew they would help me when I had a problem finding a bank"
This hotel is best good staff and provide best sevires The breakfast in this hotel is wonderful and very personalised. The quality of food and service was par excellence.  This has the best location and every evening. 
I will always recommend travelling to mumbai but with staying in Taj hotel because the reson of seeying mumbai beautiful is actull staying in the Taj hotel  The hotel is it self is a history where by walking in it's hall you fell the history. Staff and everything in the hotel was fantastic.  My only advice would be to increase number of big cars for families or may be tie up with an agency which has a big car with driver to make our life easy
"Thank you for everything .. that was an amazing experience .. I like everything there ,even the service and the staff.  تجربة حلوة في الفندق . يهتمون بأدق التفاصيل و في الخدمة على طول .. فندق فخم و جميل و نظيف .. و الاستاف جدا خدومين.. انصح اللي حابين يزورون مومباي يحجزون في فندق التاج ولا اروع red_heart"
"We went her on my bday.. Taj made sure I feel special on my bday, loved each and every gesture of theirs. They properly is so so beautiful.. will take your breath away. And the staff is so courteous and humble that I don’t have words. They have such a beautiful huge pool and steam is also very good. We always love being guests at the Taj. I feel like spending all our special occasions at The Taj only."
"All their Team is excellent and felt their energy positively while communicating My needs, they took care of everything very well, felt special and relaxing  wonderful mix of culture / arts on display throughout the property with full amenities and needs taken care of very well by their whole team"
"An outstanding Hotel in an outstanding location. We spend as a family for twi nights and it was such a great escape from the hazzle and rush of mumbais streets. An incredible 30m Pool, never crowded. Great dining and drinking facilities. A real luxury escape."
"This was fabulous place I had ever gone ,loved this so much  with cool weather and this was my best experience of my life . you will also find the piece of your life with these amazingly beautiful sceneries."
"The Service was excellent, the ambience in the hotel was amazing. The attention to detail applied by staff was impressive and the range of facilities and amenities was great.  You must try the art corner where you get a chance to express your moods and thoughts.  A visit to the swimming pool and gym area is a must. "
We had a wonderful stay. Excellent service and great food. Attentive to details. Just Awesome. We could not fault the hotel and the management was always meeting guests. The service in te restaurant was very good and the food of great quality 
"Excellent for leisure and also for business..... nice ambiance, location, privacy also place to roan around. Heritage property well maintained & preserved ...good food and ample of choices for eating..connectivity is bit challenge but places are accessible"
I stayed here for 3 nights in January 2018.  The hotel is gorgeous and the best of the 3 Taj hotels I stayed at during my 2 week trip to India.  They were very accommodating and the location was very nice even right across the street from a major tourist attraction.  I would go back if I ever in Mumbai again.
"loved the stay @ Taj Mahal @ the palace wing.. if you in south mumbai , this is the place to stay, the palace wing is one of its kind. the service is better than most Taj properties , Sea lounge faces the sea , the view is very unique "
"This is some kind of a legacy. Having stayed at hotels around India, this comes as something which raises the bar. Excellent location, wonderful staff and the overall feel of the place is amazing. Really loved the food choice here and hotel staff members were simply professional. This is the hotel you would like to stay while in Mumbai"
"Stayed here with family on trip to India. Centrally located with fantastic ambiance  Booked rooms in the old wing, only place to stay as you get all the extras. Ie airport pick up, in room check in, breakfast and high tea, cocktails included!  Everyone in the family loved it"
"This is old established hotel which values its guests, provided impeccable service and constantly upgrades its facilities, restaurants and menus. It hosts a lot of vips including heads of state and governments, major stage and screen starsand other luminaries. Given the security restrictions they impose best to avoid when major figures are resident- unless of course you enjoy gawking at them!"
This place has a feel and ambiance that are unique and unforgettable. That is why many repeat guests refuse to stay elsewhere.  Great service from most of the staff - though the ones at the travel desk can be a bit hurried and perhaps involuntarily impertinent because they are a bit too busy. The Masala Kraft is an Indian restaurant which probably appeals more to visitors and tourists than real residents of India.  Their menu could do with a bit of revamping. The sightseeing guide that we got for a four-hour tour of the city was not all that fluent in English and that person seemed to be occasionally plugging the local ruling party’s ideology or culture.  But we are not Indian citizens and so we were polite about it and we let it all pass. Golden Dragon - Chinese restaurant -
"'What's the point of going all the way to Mumbai, from Sydney Australia, if you aren't going to stay at the Taj Palace?' This thought consumed me for months as I agonised whether to spend the money required to stay there...  Sanity prevailed thankfully, so my travel partner and I booked three nights accommodation, with a sea view on the second floor of the Taj Palace.   When you arrive, flanked by tourists like a celebrity, you exit your car and Mumbai's heat and enter a veritable utopia, a polished grandeur, a cool new reality far removed from the world outside.  It's simply grand.  You enter a large reception area and are offered a blessing for a welcome stay. It's the smiles though, they greeted you and warm your heart, that impress. Everyone is immaculate and exudes a"
Iconic hotel on Arbian sea facing the picturesque Gateway of Indian. Very motivated and dedicated staff. Implacable hospitality smooth check in to emotional check out.  The best buffet spread for morn ing breakfast. Fresh baked breads served on table with pleasant smile and touch of warmth.  Thank you for gifting pleasant mornings day after day. Enjoyed every moment of stay.
"The Taj Palace is renowned as one of the great hotels of the world so my expectations were high—and they were exceeded. Everything about this magical spot is truly spectacular: the setting by the sea, the extraordinarily wonderful staff, the splendor of the rooms, the restaurants. Everything! An unforgettable experience. "
"One of the best experience of lavishness is here. Of all the taj i have visited, this was the best one. Excellent hospitality. Really loved the heritage value of the place. Hugely recommended. Overall u will love the place and experience."
"Excellent service, excellent food, excellent environment, amazing check-in and check-out experience. Very good location for outside exploration.  Closely shopping area and approachable variety of   restaurants even outside and near to hotel if someone want to explore."
"I had visited the Taj during previous stays in Mumbai but had never booked in as a guest. It is one of the world's most aesthetically beautiful hotels. A quick walk around the inside of the property reveals all kinds of architectural wonders and artistic touches. My room was both comfortable and well-equipped. In fact, I stayed for 3 nights and was upgraded to a suite for my 2nd and 3rd nights - thank you! This property is a must-see regardless of whether you stay as a guest. Drop by for a meal or drink at least. Even better, book in for a night or two - you will not regret it!"
"Ive never felt so important and appreciated staying at a hotel before until I stayed for 4 nites (10-16 Jan 2016) at Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai. I really felt like a QUEEN there with very fabulous & huge room with a dome over my head on the very spacious king size bed... It was like a SNOW WHITE sleeping in a whole white room. Will try to stay there again. My many thanks for all the friendly staff there from the point I reached there (receptionist), housekeeping team, concierge and all. The food is GREAT. Way to go the Management of the hotel."
"The best hotel in India, I hv stayed so many hotels in India, but this is the excellent , every thing in hotel was excellent and like palace, I always recommend to my friends for this hotel, I enjoyed fully "
"We come back at Taj Mahal Palace, heritage wing, after some year and the experience didn't changed. We booked an Heritage club room to celebrate my wife wedding. The surprise at the arrival was greate. They full the room with colorful balloon and a small pillow with Happy Birthday hand crafted on the bed. The Butler service was incredible and for this we have to thanks Adrian Fernandes, who made our stay more comfortable and happier. Everything was arranged properly, from the fabulous private dinner at the Chambers with personalized menù to the simple reservation for a table at the pool side. I think that Taj is a world leading hotel chain for the services, and the experiences in the Heritage palaces is greater than all the other. The hotel keep the fascination the feel of the"
"Stayed in this hotel for two nights in July. Its a gem. The service is superb, the rooms beautiful, breakfast was amazing. The hotel is well located in Mumbai by the gate of India. I would very much recommend you treat yourself"
"From the moment we arrived until the moment we checked out this hotel surpassed all our expectations.  We had booked a Tower room but as we had our teenage son with us, they gave us a complimentary upgrade to the Palace wing which had slightly bigger rooms. What a treat.  Staff simply couldn’t have been more helpful or friendly and the little turn down touches and attention to detail made our stay extra special. Our son became ill towards the end of our stay and the staff could not have done more to assist and to make sure he was as comfortable as possible.  Probably the best hotel I have stayed in, and I stay in a lot of hotels.  Can’t wait for my next Taj experience"
"Royalty aboard, right from the reception to checkout. Amazing food options, great bf great customisation and attention to details. Nothing to complain at all. Great food options with 4 restaurants serving different cuisine. Gateway of India and other local places must visit."
"Used my complimentary voucher received along with inner circle membership for a monsoon weekend Pros- 1) palace rooms d architecture were mindblowing. 2) electric mirror TV at bathroom was a really ""vow"" - a thing above imagination. 3) a secure lift for palace rooms - without jet one can't operate the lift. 4) lovely flower decorations daily in the lobby d at pool entrance 5) sea lounge restaurant brunch was delicious with lot of varieties  Cons 1) inspite of silver membership no free upgrades available, spent additional 10k for palace room upgrade along with few freebies (high tea at palace lounge & brunch at sea lounge) since my wife was interested to book in palace instead of tower. Felt very dejected since after additional fare also got partial sea view room only. 2) missed"
"Classic architecture, sumptuous rooms and decor throughout the hotel, exceptional service and beautiful gardens. This hotel is exceptional. The only complaint is that I didn't stay more than one night! Absolutely fantastic, for a comfortable and luxurious stay look no further. Very well situated and every need catered for. Did get to enjoy a relaxed breakfast overlooking the garden and the guest service is outstanding"
"I was here in 2016 and March 2017  This hotel is in a league of its own.  What they portray is what you get.  Service is second to none.  From the minute you arrive until you leave you are treated like royalty.  It was not the first time to this hotel and will not be the last If you are considering travelling to Mumbai Stay at the Taj, everything about it is wonderful "
"A fabulous hotel with fantastic staff who make your stay absolutely wonderful. The staff are always on hand to help with any needs and are extremely friendly and attentive. They make you feel special.  From check in to check out, the service was smooth. We had some noise issues on the first night due to roadworks outside and this was immediately resolved the following day with a change of room. No fuss at all and they were also generous to offer us an upgrade, which I was very surprised and pleased about. They took great detail in making sure we had a pleasant stay and even down to being personally spoken to by the manager of the hotel.    The hotel has great ambience, beautiful decor, and ample facilities, all perfectly looked after with great pride and love. I would strongly"
"We have been experiencing India with Taj for a few years now and must say every single time the ‘Tajness’ blows us away!!!! Though the Taj at Apollo Bunder is one of the busiest hotels of the chain, service levels were impeccable, staff makes you feel so special, food was amazing as usual - all in all everything that you expect Taj to be. We had booked a city facing room but upon check-in wanted to move to a sea facing room as it was my husband’s first time in Bombay and the reservations staff were super helpful and in spite of the hotel being fully booked managed to find us a gorgeous room on level 15. I was in Bombay after 17 years and it was a nostalgic & memorable visit."
"Came here as a family of 6, our 3 twin rooms in the tower got upgraded to the palace. Beautiful rooms and views, comfortable beds, good shower, great location in terms of a base from which to walk around the city... could go on forever really.  The breakfast was the highlight of all of Mumbai for us. Would also recommend the hotel tour which was entertaining as well as informative."
"Amazing afternoon tea in the Sea Lounge, we payed 2000 rupees for the afternoon tea buffet, served 3.30pm-6.30pm. Excellent value for money with a vast selection of teas/coffee, hot snacks and scones and cakes, all served with a sea view! No hotel compares for the service and attention to detail at the Taj! "
"Took out my friend for an evening meal on her birthday. She staff suggested rajma Chawal would be a good pick as we are Vegan and also told us that we cant get a Birthday cake/ vegan desert.  To our surprise, we were served Roti- sabzi papad. Once we informed the staff that we were expecting rajma chawal, the Roti's were replaced with Rice. We had to again point out that we asked for rajmaa- after a 10 minute convo, the staff returned wit the same random sabzi saying that Rajmaa cant be prepared without Dairy products.  I didn't want my friend to return home without having a lunch, so we had to eat whatever was served to us. Also not sure why a Vegan option for Desert/ cake is not available?  I suspect there must have been some miscommunication between the serving staff and the"
I went there with friends and enjoyed alot. We stayed there for 1 day and the rooms were spacious and service was amazing and food was also great and we also had breakfast for free and that was also outstanding.
I usually don’t post reviews but had to  this time because of few incidences that made our stay memorable. We have stayed at Taj Mumbai and other Taj locations but this was our first time with kids and it exceeded our expectations. I wish I knew the names of all the staff members we interacted with but special mention to Chetan Konde for going the extra mile to make our little one happy. Highly recommend the hotel for couple and family with young kids. 
"Taj is taj. The property, the food, the ambiance, the services, this is where you get everything. I just had lunch there and  couldnt keep myself from licking my fingers. I would love to stay here some day but cant afford right now. #tajmoments"
"We spent three nights at the Taj and couldn't be happier.  While it was more costly than most other hotels in mumbai,  the experience is worth it.  The staff were remarkable and always eager to help,  they are there at your door 24 hours it seems to provide any assistance.    The breakfast was well done for a buffet.  I had the Indian fare, but my husband had the western food.  We both thought the food was excellent considering its a buffet.  They even made a special omelet for him (which was not part of the offering).  It was my husband's birthday while we were there,  the hotel surprised him with an arrangement in the room with balloons,  flowers and cake. It made his day special.    Watch the TV station about the history of the hotel. If you're lucky,  there will be an Indian"

"The name Taj Mahal, translates to the ‘Crown Palace’ and is one of the most famous and marvelous buildings in India. Located in the city of Agra, Taj Mahal is actually a mausoleum built to house the remains of Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. The building is known for its extensive use of white marble and was completed in the mid-17th century"
"The rooms were very good and service was excellent. No one can beat Taj in hospitality and personalized service, that is delightful.The location (Gateway of India & sea facing) adds to the wholesome experience. "
Your cuctomer have to make a aed currency to charge a cutomer.Not in rupees.Why i am saying beacsue before i am booking i already told that i will pay in online in aed currency.But from account your restervations india currency also charge it not good.
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal palace tower hotel for 3 nights. Checking-in was a breeze, Mr.Harendra Naidu made us feel very welcome after a long journey here and gave us an upgrade for a fabulous view of the gateway of India. Absolutely the best hotel in Mumbai. Hospitality at its finest, from the moment we arrived till the last minute we stepped out. Ms. Meghana Pitale checking in on us for the whole stay, making sure we have everything we needed. All the staff were helpful and friendly. They also offer a heritage tour of the hotel. Amazing food. Conveniently located in the heart of Colaba . Superb view of the gateway of India, right in front of the hotel. Will definitely return!"
"Nice welcome by hotel staff, nice room, nice sea view room, birthday set up was good. My wife feel happy with set up and hotel, what they do for her birthday.  I Really thanks to Taj and there staff, thank you everyone."
"their are few places in our country where you spend the money that too a large amount and get the fullest satisfaction, Taj Mahal Hotel is one of that. The crown on top of the building is still being maintained in services, room standard and in restaurants. Keep it up you are really a TAJ among a lot of others,Modernity with traditions you amalgam both in effortless manner."
"Stayed here for three nights last month and it was a rather underwhelming experience. Every corner of this property is a sight to behold, which, I suppose, all and sundry know by now. And I’d say it is exactly for this reason that staying here did not feel like the ultimate pampering experience as one expects from a property of its stature and price point. There are just too many visitors (and not hotel guests per se) buzzing around at any given moment, which is why, I feel, the staff are always distracted. Having said that, I’m not going to put much weight to this for the utterly impersonal stay that I had.  From the moment I arrived (from another Taj property, by the way, where the experience was completely different — Vivanta by Taj President) I just never felt at ease. The"
"The highest standard of service and quality, as expected from Taj. The Suites were spacious, and the butler was always on hand to ensure our stay was comfortable. The foot spa in the room in the evening was welcome, and the breakfast spread was truly enjoyable."
"This is easily the best hotel I have ever stayed in. It really lives up to its reputation- the staff, the cleanliness, the decor, the facilities, the history - I could go on. We had an awesome weekend here and were very spoilt in every way. Some tips to make the most of it are to definitely stay in the old palace portion of the hotel as opposed to the tower, and to fork out for a suite which (while more expensive, admittedly) gives you some amazing perks which made the stay even better. First- the room is amazing with several living spaces and an envious bathroom plus complimentary afternoon tea in the palace lounge (sooo good!), complimentary cocktail hour + pre-dinner canapés and after dinner cognac and chocolates! We basically didn’t leave the hotel all weekend, spending our"
"Beautiful Property, Beatiful people, Impeccable Service, Excellant food, Souk was out of the world never had better mediterranian fare, Golden Dragon was good but should use less of chillies the menu of Golden Dragon gave no clues as to the spice level of the dish. I think that the time has come for Eateries in India should be sble to offer the same dish from very spicy to bland taste. Missed out on Wasabi as did not get the time slot. Should have an exclusive Restraunt serving Maharastrian food only and should also have an authenic Parsi fare. The premier Hotel should promote more of Indian culture and food than is being done Some Downsides  1) House keeping Service is a little slow 2) Special tables should be reserved in Wasabi for In Hotel Guests 3) Being aTATA Hotel should"
"Since the moment you arrive, the great service and exquisite attention are incredible... highly recommended to stay in the most iconic hotel of India... the luxury of the facilities, the confortable room full of details do that this place becomes unforgettable..."
"Staying at The Taj Mahal Mumbai has been a Childhood Dream Come True. I loved the traditional Indian Welcome with a Basil Garland during the Check-In and the Front Desk ensured to accompany to the Room to demonstrate how to use the Facilities. At I had dinner at MASALA KRAFT and the Veg Biryani had all the right ingredients and tasted awesome. The staff are extremely friendly and customer focussed, they usually go out of their way to make your stay comfortable. The Breakfast in SHAMIANA is something not to miss and they serve the Best Continental Breakfast with an Indian Touch. The Masala Dosas, Poha and Tomato Vermicelli were out of this world. The property is located facing the Arabian Sea and my Room was facing the India Gate and offered me peace and tranquility. I felt"

We were upgraded to a beautiful room in the palace wing ... simply the most amazing experience.... our butler was most attentive and friendly... what stands out is the pool... amazing pool...it is perhaps one of the best pools that exist in hotels... Thanks Devia who made sure that we get settled nicely...
"There are two parts to the hotel--the tower portion and the palace portion.  We initially were booked in the tower portion but decided to upgrade to a suite in the palace--which is the older portion of the hotel but so much more luxurious.  The upgrade was definitely worth the extra money.  The suite is gorgeous with beautiful footed bath tub.  When staying in the palace, you have your own butler--who waits on you hand and foot.  You also get breakfast, high tea, happy hour and ""cognac & chocolate"" included with your room.  It was fantastic.  Hotel is steps from the Gateway of India so you can't get a better location.  Can't do better than this hotel."
The best you can get in Bombay.... Very beautiful view from balcony.... Best food I have ever had... Better than trident ... Cheerful Ambience.. friendly and a welcoming staff.loved the room. Must go for it... 
"This seems to be the best Taj hotel. It seems the company has given the best staff, best service ethics, best food for this property. It’s a pity Yaj doesn’t follow the same standard with their other properties. It’s like they fool you with this exemplary hotel and you go to the other Taj hotels with same expectations and get disappointed.   The pros.... everything is good. Service, staff, food and location. This has the best location and every evening we would walk to cafe Leopold or Mondegar for some beers and a bite.  The breakfast in the Palace hotel is wonderful and very personalised. The quality of food and service was par excellence. We loved the South Indian coffee which was served at our table.  The biggest drawback was when we checked out after 4 days. We didn’t get"
The reviews are all correct.   Taj Palace is an awesome hotel and had a great stay. I was originally in the tower and due to a bathroom problem I was moved to the palace wing. I was glad of the move. It would be worth the extra.   The staff everywhere were exceptional. A real credit to the team. 
"I stayed for the weekend in the Taj. Reception was unparalleled, friendly and swift. The organized yoga sessions were effective, although I would have wished for more space in the treatment room. Food is very versatile in many restaurants. I tried the Indian place and enjoyed it a lot. The Taj is a busy place, so I loved to retreat to the hall close to the pool. Here I also had breakfast and drinks. The old city is just minutes away and the Taj organizes a walking tour for me. All in all a very pleasant experience I can recommend. For Europeans the prices are more than acceptable. "
"The staff makes all the difference to this wonderful hotel. Simply wonderful service in the concierge, check-in, travel desk, restaurants and house keeping. My son’s were truly impressed by the attentive staff. Loved our stay. "
Loved the stay at the Taj. Food at Masaba was gorgeous. the rooms in the new side are not as big. But we had a suite in the group and that was simply awesome experience. Loved the stay and the hospitality by the Taj staff.
"Stay at the iconic sea-facing landmark of Mumbai.Experience true grandeur at Taj Mahal Palace, the iconic sea-facing landmark in Colaba, South Mumbai.Built in 1903, the iconic Taj Mahal Palace stands majestically opposite the Gateway of India, overlooking the Arabian Sea."
Beautiful hotel. A must go when in Mumbai. It’s also overlooking the gateway of India so you can kill 2 birds in 1 stone. Takes about 30-45mins to walk around. Beautiful well maintained interior. And if you have the time it will be worthwhile to dine there or have high tea at the cafe.
"The staff makes all the difference. Loved how the duty manager always knew my name and came over to say hello. If you have to meet VIP's in Mumbai, always pick the Taj. This is the best hotel in terms of security, discretion and luxury for business meetings when you need to be comfortable and entertain high-level guests."
I really wanted for a longtime to stay in this historical hotel for my first visit in Mumbay...and was happilly more than satisfied!!! The rooms are great Hotel kept his authentic charm Service and staff are simply perfect Its a Must in India!!!
My name is ammar ahmad am visit taj hotel staff very friendly and good food room very clean am stay two days for bussiness trip ist dat night time my little fever am inform manager he help him one staff go medical.center he get medicine for me
"The best part of Mumbai was this hotel. Breakfast was amazing, service terrific, the room incredible and a fantastic swimming pool. Everything about the hotel was great, even the gym, not very big, but always empty."
"Attended a full day conference here. The arrangements were excellent, right from the entrance, where event location and directions were clearly posted to the courteous staff. Food was OK. Highlight of the day was the high tea and excellent cookies from the hotel bakery. The rooms are grand, the carpeting detailed and well kept. The chandeliers in all rooms are something else altogether. Must visit for any proud Mumbaikar."
This Mumbai historical place is one of the best hotel in the world. Service is incredible and the hotel carries more than 120 years of history. Don't miss the guided visit of the hotel where you will learn a lot about it.
Great Service and Beautiful rooms The room size was good and very well done. Staff was very friendly and ready to service very promptly . THIS IS ONE OF BEST HOTEL  IN INDIA. Highly recommended . The location is very good with sea view from our suite 
The one who love the architect of the 70s they visit the taj once only the thing is that was a bit of a noise if you stay in the gateway of India facing rooms but the experience were too good the food was delicious I would give you 20 out of 10.
It is always a please to stay at this hotel. Everything is impeccable. The staff The rooms The food The service This time we stayed during the Christmas period (we were a little sad being away from family during this time) and loved the choir singing Christmas carols. And looking around the hotel I could say that all the other international travellers did also. Well done Taj!!!
"Beautiful hotel which makes you feel you are part of History. Beside the location, the hotel is like an island in teh middle of busy Mumbai and definitely the place to stay if you wish to feel the pulse of the city."
"Wonderful stay , amazing food and staff 11 out of 10. Thank you Taj. Went to celebrate our 49th anniversary and Taj made sure we had the best memory of the day. We very well taken care of right from the room decoration and the welcome everything was just perfect. We were touched by the gesture."
Traveled to Mumbai for business and stayed  in the Taj Palace. Checkin was a breeze and love their  basil garland . Also rooms are really clean and spacious ( for Mumbai standard) and mine was overlooking the ocean which was really  awesome. Its a big property with lot of guests staying but you never get a feeling that its crowded. Love the different spread of cheese for the breakfast and the one thing that stands-out is their service. Overall loved my stay
It's one of the heritage hotel of India. Worth visiting once in a while. Food served is delicious and hospitality is splendid. Interiors of the Hotel are amazing. Such a long beautiful heritage hotel.
"Stayed there for a week for conference in April 2017, Taj Mumbai is the best hotel in memory. The culture and style of the staff there are just so different with other places: elegant, amazingly detail-focused, honest and generous. "
"I was so impressed by this hotel, and by Mumbai as well. We stayed in the Palace side, and I would absolutely recommend that to anyone with a sense of history. Loved our room with a view to the Gateway of India and the harbor filled with boats every day. We could even hear the waves crashing in the morning while lying in bed. That was a surprise. The Taj breakfast every morning in the Sea Lounge was absolutely great (only exception being the first morning when hostess seemed a bit testy...she apologized the next morning and that was appreciated). The Taj certainly has some incredibly talented pastry chefs as the croissants we had each morning were top notch and reminded me of Paris. Also, service staff was efficient and friendly, always there to offer refills on coffee or water."
"We had a wonderful stay with smooth check-in within few minutes of arrival. Met the Director of Rooms during the check-in process and we experienced a warm welcome from her. Food, Services were all absolutely perfect. The stay was superb and memorable. We would definitely return again."
I was gifted this by my family for our 5th anniversary and I was booked in the Tower Wing but the hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade to the Palace wing. The staff was great overall and made us feel very special on our special 5th anniversary
Everything perfect. I had not heard NO from any one from staff during my stay .check in and checkout was fast and smooth .Breakfast was near perfect. Overall very good experience. Please continue spoiling US 
"No word better suited for this place than iconic. As u pass along with white corridors u r reminded of the dignitaries who once stayed at the hotel. And it's a list of the who's who of the world. The walls, corridors, staircases, hallway - everything in the hotel is tastefully decorated and nothing is out of place. "
"I went to the hotel for lunch. Before i enter the restaurant, i did ask whether they serve ala carte or no. They say yes. I order some juice and a pizza since most of the food are not available during lunch because they focus on buffet only. It's ok i try to understand. I come with my friends. They also order some of the food that available. When we finish, we ask for separate bill/receipt. Suddenly the waiter, his nama is Rajendra, show his angry face and say this is iconic hotel, it's hard for them to make a separate bill. I explain that we nees separate bill because we need to claim to our company. This is the procedure. Then he just shake his head and go. He purposedly delaying prepare the bill. We wait for 20 minute and he give the bill and at the same time showing really"
Hotel atmosphere is very fresh and positive. The staff is very polite and cooperative. When enter the hotel you feel relax.....  Hotel Rooms are very clean and service is very good.  My advice is visit this Hotel.  
"If you are looking for a hotel that makes you feel on top of the world when you wake up in the morning then this is the one. You get a view of the sea and the gateway of India, a look that relaxes you to the fullest. Great services as always. Overall a good place to stay."
"Perfect location, absolute stunning decor, A1 butler service, friendly staff, delicious meals and several fine dining options to choose from, history (the old building is the best part), many shops inside the hotel with luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton. You feel pampered from arrival to departure. Stay here. :)"
I was there for 4 days with my family.Thorighly enjoyed my stay there.The bed and the pillows are one of the best i have ever felt(if anyone knows the brand-i would love to buy some for my home).the panoramic view of the gateway and appolo bunder from sea lounge and souk was a treat to the eyes.
"Was an excellent experience, The best in India, one the best in the world. Staff was courteous & prompt in service & humble. One Sandeep service Supervisor at 6th floor was an outstanding deserves promotion out of way."
"You will get a feeling of Royal as soon as you enter the hotel. Courteous staff awesome location. I tried all the restaurants and each one of them serves excellent food.   For the breakfast, you should try RS floor or Sea Lounge if you want to enjoy your food with a good view."
"This is one of the best hotels which provides luxury and essence of long history . With very classy interiors n friendly staff , this hotel gets considered at the top 5 places in my list . Very good n favourite "
"I have stayed in various taj hotels and many other 5 star hotels as well but this one sp far is the best of the best. Amazing service facilities rooms staff, everyone here is so lively. Will come back again very soon"
"I stayed at Taj Gateways during my planned vacation for IPL playoffs and it was the best someone could ask for. Checked in early at 10am which was graciously accepted by the management and we were upgraded to Palace club room. The rooms were class apart from the luxury being offered across the world's and not even comparable in my earlier vacations in Europe, Americas, South Africa's and to the far east. Truly emaculate with extended offerings and services. Best part was catching up with Sunrisers XI during our stay which was icing on the cake. The buffet spread was excellent and the chef hand made Gobhi paranthas were mouth watering. Evening cocktails on the house will definately make you high on life and high tea sessions were one amongst the best highlight. Location wise you"
"I have honestly stayed in some of the supposed most prestigious hotels in the world and literally nothing comes close to the impeccable service received. The hotel staff go out of their way to greet and make you feel welcomed. Considering this hotels monumental history, its kept in pristine condition with continuous maintenance bring done in an orderly manor. Check in was a breeze and we where shown to our room by the same staff member at check in. To our room within the palace section with a sea view and partial gateway of India view. Room was exceptional and more than comfortable with an almost perfect bed. Bathrooms was grand as well. The in room ammenties were all perfect and of great quality. Rose petal designs made on the floor, all our cables/cords/chargers etc was neatly"
"The Taj Mahal Palace hotel is one of the best hotels for us in Mumbai. The place is full of history, and bring the old world charm with modem amenities.   The rooms are huge and spacious. The facilities at par with the best hotels we have been in.  The service is par excellence.  It also has some of the best restaurants in-house for a luxurious meal."
"This is a beautiful hotel, the rooms are well sized, well equipped and beautifully maintained. The pool area can get a bit busy when the hotel is full, but is still a great place to relax and swim. As always the staff are universally excellent, friendly and knowledgeable. The fact that standards have not dropped when so many other luxury hotels are penny inching is a credit to everyone at the hotel and its management. I will be back yet again for sure."
"The hotel is located at historic place of Mumbai, Overlooking the Gate Way of India. The breakfast spread is amazing and the taste too is superb.Only issue is the reservation needs to handle booking with more efficiency.Little more too need to taken in respect with laundry service."
"Spending three nights at ' The Taj ' was a wonderful way to finish a tour of Southern India. We had a Sea View Club Room with views of the ocean and ' The Gateway of India ' which afforded access to afternoon tea and cocktails. We did not try the in - house restaurants.  Once we were through security and the lobby area, we found the rest of the hotel very calm and efficient. The uncrowded pool area was welcome after tours of the city and a Mumbai at Dawn trip.  We have already recommended ' The Taj ' to others."
The food at Seaside Lounge is superb .The ideal place to spend time with near and dear ones.The Service is par excellence .The view of sea is beautiful.The dishes are authentic .Live misc is beautiful.You can never get tired of the way .
"This is a beautiful hotel we didn't stay there but we had the privelege of seeing a lot of it first hand The outside is wow material inside it's awesome except the memorial to the victims of the terrorist attack We saw the pool area, high tea being served & the beautiful stairwell to name a few highlight We had a personal Amish of Mumbai Moments who was the best which made it even better"
"We booked this hotel as we have seen it featured in National Geographic Channel as ""Hotel India"". We were not disappointed. The very first thing you'll notice here is excellent and efficient customer service. From the booking and arranging of airport transfer, this has already became apparent. As I booked through a third-party online booking system, I was communicating with them through email for an airport transfer. When we reached Mumbai one hour late, we easily found two hotel staff in their good looking hotel uniforms waiting for us near the arrival gate. They cheerfully escorted us to the vehicle and off we went. Inside the car, we were provided water, candies, refresh-tissues and wifi. When we reached the hotel, we were greeted by our personal receptionist who gave us a"
"I'm visiting this hotel since 2012, what happened today (21/05/2018) was unexpected. As I didn't have time to eat at restaurant, I brought my food to the hotel. Security at the scan refused to allow. Mr.Rahul, one of the manager told, as per government policy they can't allow cooked outside food. I asked for that govt order, then he told its Management policy. After a tiring day,I didn't want to argue and ended up eating the food in front of their gate, literally near the road. I came to know that they allowed one of the foriegner to carry out side food. Even I saw one Mc Donald's guy was standing near the gate to deliver the food to room guest. Is this your policy...? how can you justify..? Thank you Taj Mahal.. Salute to the great brilliant policy maker.. keep it up.."
"Most famous hotel in India and in my opinion the best. Congratulation to the management staff to have such ptofesional teams at the front desk , restaurants, swiming pool, spa , house keeper. Thanks to  all of them I spent 3 wonderful days. If you are looking for a hotel in Mumbai  this is the ONE."
"This hotel is one of the most beautiful & luxurious hotel at mumbai ,   All amenities provided by hotel like gym , spa , all indoor games , bar , and many more things,   as the food quality is ultimate good   overall hotel is good"
Mindblowing experience best food best laundry services best housekeeping service best room services I enjoyed with my friends it remember those days experience lifetime I suggest to all experience and enjoy
"The room had a good view of the gateway of India n the sea. Cleanliness maitained very well n the staff are very professional. In addition to the room, the hotel has various attractions like the beautiful n contemporary paintings etc which are must see"
"Very well located, prime property, particularly if you get the Palace room. Rooms are rather small but well designed and luxurious. All amenities were good and excellent ambience. Just walking through the corridors is an awesome experience. Food tends to be a bit expensive (though exquisite taste) but there are a lot of places around the hotel which can be explored for reasonably price good food. One could try Bade Miya just around the corner for Mughlai food. Retrieval from valet parking can be a challenge. It took me 20 minutes to get the car. "
"We had the most amazing stay in this beautiful period hotel, surrounded by such history and beauty. It’s in a great location right next to the Gateway of India, and a short drive to everything else you’d like to do such as the Crawford Market, the boats to the Elephanta Caves, The Queens Necklace etc. The staff were also amazing and everything about this hotel is 5 Star, including the restaurants and food. I even trusted this hotel enough to have ice in my drink..not something I did anywhere else in our trip to India. There are cheaper places to stay, but not with this service and quality. Treat yourself if you’re in Mumbai. "
"The heritage property is a landmark in itself in Mumbai and we loved every bit of it. The sea lounge had a very good buffet spread and has stunning views of the sea. Our three year old had loads of fun. There are some ongoing renovation works, so expect some waiting times for your car or the valet. Other than that everything was smooth and the staff were really helpful. Would certainly recommend this property to anyone visiting Mumbai."
"Came for business and pleasure everything about this hotel is amazing from the moment you arrive to moment you leave. Nothing is too much trouble and the service is just so good, and after  day on the streets of Mumbai to come back to the Taj is immediate relaxation in itself.  Had a Club Room so was able to take advantage of High Tea, Cocktails and Cognac and Chocolate, aswell as the amazing breakfast in the Sea Lounge. All the staff are amazing, and they all seemingly know your name, but special mention for Kiran who not only looked after us in the Masala Kraft restaurant at lunch but also looked after us at Breakfast and sorted out an amazing authentic Indian breakfast on each day. If you have never tried an Indian Breakfast give it a go - it will set you up for the day. This"
"Fantastic location for the Southern highlights of Mumbai. Certainly lived up to all expectations. We booked a Club Room for our stay, excellent package with various facilities including one way airport transfer, driver with full whites including hat and gloves!! Room spacious with full facilities and accessories. Staff amazing especially waiters, pool  and room staff. Iconic hotel only disappointed was some minor works to front facade had scaffolding erected during our stay so the once in a lifetime photo will need some editing!!"
World's Best Hotel I ever visited.The service is very great.Big rooms and gardens.Special guest services. Rooms are very big and great facilities. I want to live there long time. Fare not so high.It provide better environment.
"We have had a thoroughly enjoyable few days at the Taj Mahal Palace. The building is magnificent - beautifully maintained and embedded in history. The staff are sublime. Expert in making you feel special, they are happy to help, with exceptional courtesy and efficiency. The food in each venue is varied and all of the same impeccably high standard. Our room is large and spotlessly clean. There is sufficient furniture without appearing cluttered. The bed is very comfortable with luxurious linen. The marble bathroom is spacious with a terrific shower and a lovely bath. Finally, the pool is huge, warm and never particularly busy. It is absolutely perfect after a stroll through the fascinating streets of Mumbai. We would thoroughly recommend the Taj Mahal Palace to everyone, and"
Whenever you visit mumbai and wanted to visit gateway of india then do stay at taj. From gateway of india you can easy go to elephanta cave. From hotel window the seashore and attraction for tourist is awesome. Mostly you will be spending day time outside hotel but when you comeback after the whole day trip do join the club inside taj for a beautiful night and food and classic drinks. Stay at home comfort.
"For More Than 25 years Going To INDIA ,,Nothing Bitter Than Taj Palace In MUMBAI,The staff and services Are the best, And Taj Managment realy Have The Best Welcoming and helpful staff. Ihave been to alot of diffrent states in in India and stayed in many diffrent hotels but i always looks fir taj branch because they realy cares,,"
"This iconic hotel lived up to it's reputation and was located in a great location in the gateway to India, close to all main attractions with excellent views of the harbour. The hotel is lively and the service is exceptional. The Japanese restaurant by chef Morimoto is a must do and was also exceptional. I loved the history behind the hotel and it's connection to the city. I believe it's the only place to stay in Mumbai...."
For me its more than a 5 star glowing_star this restaurant deserve this.. For me if any one get time from their busy schedule in life they should visit at least once with family... U ll get a different feel one u are inside this 
"I do not know what I can say that hasn't already been said.  From the moment you walk in you are treated like someone really special.  Staff cater for you all the time, heaven help you if you try and do something yourself!  Rooms are superb.  I got upgraded to a Club room (there was some work going on in part of the hotel not that you would know from the inside, but could see from the road), and had I known I would have gone for one of these rooms as you get so many perks with them. All staff were great and even when I had a free late bookout at 3pm they still came and serviced the room which hardly every happens.  Loved it.. yes it is expensive, but if you can treat yourself, then do so!  The only thing I was not keen on was the main restaurant which was a bit cafeteria type"
My wife and I stayed two nights in the tower of the taj hotel to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. The staff from start to finish were exceptional. You can tell that they are well trained and genuinely enjoy their work. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The taj is amazing and steeped in history. The food is delicious and choice plentiful. The concierge staff stood out for me their assistance was greatly appreciated. You can have a wonderful hotel and be let down by poor staff. The staff really are the stand out memory for us at the hotel. Management shud be proud of them. 
"I have resisted staying in the original Hotel for years. I told my wife why spend so much just to sleep and eat. By chance we were in Mumbai on the night of the terrible terrorist attack of 26 November 2008 and after over 30 trips to India I gave in. There was a recent BBC series about how the staff are trained, their loyalty etc. The hotel has been restored fully, a miracle in itself, and quite beautifully with great subtle taste. I have to admit that I was quite wrong as it is superb. Certainly the staff are well trained but there is absolutely no feeling of subservience, waiting for tips etc. It is faultless and feels homely albeit on a scale beyond our normal lifestyle! i always make a comment for people with mobility problems. Yes, everything is perfect except for one thing"
"An Exquisite hotel with impeccable service.  Morning breakfast in the Sea Lounge looking out over the water is wonderful.   The shops were a little too pricey for me, but it was nice browsing and dreaming.  "
"One of the most beautiful hotels I've ever stayed in, with impeccable service, customer focused service and beautiful architecture and decor. This was a very special 1,5 days stay for my mum's birthday and we were treated with a free upgrade to Club rooms, her bedrooms was full of treats to celebrate her anniversary and we felt very well looked after. The pool was fantastic, they would even offer you mist and towels for a bit of a refresh. Absolutely wonderful views and the whole setting is just out of this world. We stayed in the main building and would certainly not be open to stay at the adjacent Tower. Well done Taj. Keep it, as is, forever."
"Outstanding, stunning, simply the best and most amazing hotel I’ve been. historic palace with a great and impressive architecture. everything in the hotel goes down to the smallest details, it’s really so special and precise. what excited me most was the warm and caring attitude of the hotel staff. they so charming and helpful, whatever you need they will be there for you. the rooms are beautiful and huge with a great view. the entrance to the hotel is very imposing, it’s a big wow.. the lobby is beautifully decorated and again you can see it in every corner. for me this hotel is the best because all those amazing people that work there."
The heritage wing has old world charm. The corridors have beautiful paintings which make you feel like you are in a museum. staff are very courteous and efficient. Good food. Unparalleled location and views.
"Stayed here for business while in Mumbai. Beautiful hotel and amazing service. Stayed in a suite and which exceeded all expectations. Great restaurants, bars and shops within the hotel. Fantastic swimming pool"
"Needless to say, the best hotel in my life I ever visited. Amazing food, amazing ambience, and amazing service. I would advise when you are booking this hotel book it with 1 meal, so that you would be able to enjoy food at considerable lower price."
"We've stayed at this hotel 4 times now....each visit has been as memorable as the last. The staff are attentive and they strive to make each trip unique. Yes we faced a few niggles but every place has that. This trip was for a 50th birthday trip. I'd recommend to anyone to book a club room, having access to the club lounge is a god send! Somewhere to unwind to get away from the heat and hustle and bustle of the city. Can't wait for the next trip!"
Impressive building located close to the Gateway to India. Impeccable furnishings and comfortable. Wonderful experience to listen to the grand piano being played whilst dining. The food is of the highest standard presented well and very tasty. Service faultless all staff so friendly and polite.  Of special note are the most beautiful displays of fresh flowers that are abundant throughout the hotel. Highly recommend.
"It was a very pleasant and memorable stay at the Taj Mumbai. The front office executive, Mr. Khushnood Ahmad attended us very nicely and took enough care of us to ensure that the heritage tour, dinner at masala kraft and the overall experience was perfect. He was very attentive to anything that we needed. A charming and caring person.  Thanks"
Staying at the iconic Taj Palace in Mumbai is an experience in itself. We were upgraded free of charge to a room with a sea view and a splendid view of the major tourist spot of Gateway of India. The room was spacious and comfortable. The staff was very courteous and made us feel very welcome.  The breakfast at Shamiana was a big spread and we could really indulge.  The pool is quite well maintained and big.  I happened to know a staff member of the hotel and he took us on a tour of the hotel and explained to us events which made history which was the highlight of our stay.
"We booked 3 luxury rooms directly  with the hotel for one night stay at the Palace Wing, while we were arriving from Bhopal and were to take onto our further journey back to Houston (TX USA). We checked inn very very late in the night at 1 am.  One of our guests a French guy, was not keeping too well, we requested for late check out, but were straight away denied by the Palace wing staff ! No one seemed to understanding as we stayed less than 12 hours while paying for the full day.  Finally we ended up with the duty manager to consider and he got us a 2 hours of extension for one room only for the guest who was sick !  Such and excellent stay came to an end with very unpleasant sort of memories of my guests.   Thinking seriously whether or not to use such an Fantastic Property !"
"Wow wow wow this 5 star property is so Beautiful and full of History. From the moment you arrive no matter what the time is, your treated like a VIP. Breakfast buffet is the best we had in India. The staff from Security to Reception to The Porters, to the Resturant staff to the Cleaners are all Fabulous. I recommend the Hotel Tour you can do each day well worth hearing and seeing the history about the Palace."
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for a week to celebrate my husbands birthday. Living in Dubai we stayed at luxurious hotels before, but this one tops all of them with it's Indian Charme and it's amazing history. So many positives,that I don't know where to start! We treated ourselves to a suite and it was just beautiful! We even had a night and day butler, we felt like royalty. Breakfast at the sea lounge was a treat every morning, even though the breakfast buffet isn't the biggest, we had everything we wanted and the most attentive staff made it even more special!! When it wasn't too busy the chef himself brought the cooked breakfast to our table,what a lovely gesture!! Access to the club lounge was great, free coffee and tea and at night time free beverages with a small"
"I booked this hotel for family dinner on 24/04/2018...it was prior booking for 9.30pm but I got the table @ 10.15pm shockingly the table linens were not cleaned..table & leftovers from prior customer was cleared only after I requested it..never had such experience from 5* hotel.The table attendant was extra ordinarily Rude,When I asked him to suggest for Soup & Starters his response was ""Anything from the menu you may order""..,He spilled while serving & wasn't apologetic about it...To end our nightmare any further I decided to cut short the dinner & went to another hotel for the main course & better/ pleasing experience."
Arrived in to a warm greeting and escorted up to room 508 in the Tower. Pleasant room with a great view of the India Gate. Relaxing in room later in the day I began to hear the occupant of the room above clattering about.  This is due to the use of hard tiled floors. Why do hotels do this?  It made for a very noisy evening with the herd of elephants above.  To ensure a good night's sleep I resorted to a pair of earplugs.  The basic requirement in any hotel is to be able to sleep in peace and quiet.  This hotel fails to meet that need. If you want a relaxing stay in Mumbai then this hotel is not for you.
I had lived in India as a small girl and have a memory of the Gateway of India which I always wanted to revisit.  So at last I did it.  We stayed in the Tower wing but still had access to most of the hotel.  The view from our window was just what I had wished for - a wonderful view of the Gateway. The hotel offers a heritage tour to residents which is well worth taking.  My husband had his birthday while we were there and we returned from a day out to find our room full of balloons and a cake!  The thing that makes this hotel outstanding is the staff. Everywhere in the hotel but with a special mention to room service and the Lobby team.  We could only stay for 3 nights and then moved on because it is expensive but worth it for the experience.  Oh - and do the use the pool it is
"Ordered a full course north Indian meal for four people. There are very few restaurants which can get the serving size correct, and Shamiana absolutely nailed it! The phulkas were freshly made and served hot."
"I have wanted to visit the Taj Mahal Palace for a very long time and it didn’t disappoint. Even though we weren’t staying there and it was too early for high tea we went to the Sea Lounge for tea and cake. The service was amazing, along with lovely staff who took their time to talk to us and made us feel special. Be prepared, it isn’t cheap but for a treat it is really worth it. If there are only 2 of you, sitting by the window is a must because you can watch the world go by and see the gateway.  Just wondering through the hotel is special enough with beautiful staircases, ornate ironwork and stunning floral designs. I would do it all again if I could. "
"Visually this hotel is fantastic and is the only place to stay if this is your first time in Mumbai. The rooms were large, clean and room 521 has a great view of the pool. The bathroom has a large shower as well as a large bath. We also had the Club Lounge access which was fantastic as you get unlimited tea, coffee, soft drinks all day, plus you have high tea, canapes and cocktails, cognac and chocolate at various times during the day. This was great and all the staff in the Club Lounge were great and certainly know what customer service is all about so thank you to Nam, Dylan and everyone else there. There is currently building and roadworks going on so you cant access through the Palace entrance and enter via the Tower entrance which was a bit of a disappointment. The pool is"
"This is my 19th visit to India and more than 80% of these visits have led me to beautiful Mumbai but I have never had the privilege to stay at the Taj Palace until now. Life of a documentary filmmaker is always full of unexpected surprises and this surprise a weekend at the Taj Palace topped them all. Everything was perfect except for one thing that made me wonder how come the number one hotel in Mumbai and possibly in India doesn’t have any basic international tv stations, I went through about 50+ stations and couldn’t find even one English news channel no BBC,CNN,Sky News very puzzling indeed and definitely needs to be sorted ASAP. Aside from that everything was grand can’t wait to be back one day of the stars align again."
One of our favourite hotels for a 1-2 day break ! Stayed at the Heritage wing in a beautiful room overlooking the spectacular Gateway of India! Cleanliness upto the mark 10/10.  Service too good!! Staff courteous and polite.  Overall an amazing short stay
only issue check-in...not up to the mark had to gather all the info regarding the services again from the reception. breakfast & club lounge facilities which were included in our package were not shared with us at the time of check-in.
"An Epitome of Luxury and Excellent Service, The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is the best place to stay in Mumbai. Right from the time of Check-in the guests are treated like Royalty. Small gestures such as welcoming the guest in traditional Indian style to treating kids with yummy treats and toys, The Taj Mahal Palace makes your stay memorable!  We were staying at the Heritage Wing or the Palace Wing of the Hotel. This place is an art collector's delight. It is like staying in a Museum with unique artwork and masterpieces dating back to 17th and 18th century. The rooms are large with high ceilings, very traditional yet contemporary. The staff are attentive without being intrusive, ensuring the guest have an amazing experience during their stay at the Hotel.  The swimming pool is well"
They stay here made our trip. Fantastic service and staff. Wonderful experience and I can’t wait to visit again. Transfers we’re easily arranged.  Great range of restaurants.  The decor is outstanding and the rooms are very comfortable.  Defo worth a visit if you are in Mumbai.
"This is a ideal location, excellent view of Gateway to India and all the tourist boats docked there. Most beautiful at sunrise and sunset. Customer service excel.. Manager and staff were always pleasant and ready to serve with a smile. Thanks to Shaheen Director of Sales, for making me feel the warmth Taj Mumbai hospitality., Sunil Chowdry of housekeeping, came with a smile everyday and made sure  my room was spotless clean everyday. All meals were a treat but Tea Time /Pastries daily, was the best. It not just a five star hotel but your home away from home. Nothing beats satisfaction., love the Taj.. Liz Mandol- Toronto- Canada  "
"Stayed here at the end of our three week trip of India. Wow what a hotel just amazing...so luxurious. Our room had the most fantastic view overlooking the Gateway of India. The room was a good size, very comfortable bed with luxury linen and luxury complimentary toiletries, plenty of bottled water available. The pool area is great to sit and relax after busy days of sight seeing. We dined one evening in the Chinese restaurant and had a fabulous meal quite pricey but well worth it, great breakfast and plenty of choice. The staff make this hotel, attentive, polite and friendly, always with a ready smile. The trip had been for my birthday and the room was decorated with flowers and balloons, there was a cake and a few small presents..very thoughtful. Staying here was the perfect"
The  hotel on an authentic Indian joyrid mad mumbai choice street with its revving rickshaw bustling bazaars temple and colonial this is history lovely .the staff is nice great lobby find and great stay 
This was a once in a life time 2 night stay for me and my wife`s first trip to Mumbai. Truly amazing hotel with great history and iconic location opposite the great gateway of India.The hotel food and decor is stunning and i recommend all to atleast make a visit for a meal if not a stay overnight.You can also try eating at one of the recommended kebab places behind the hotel or visit nearby Delhi Durbar restaurant. Hotel food was cost you around £100+ for a couple whereas some of the local restaurants will cost you around £10 for a 2 course meal so good to mix it up a bit. We stayed at the JW Marriott Juhu for the second half of our stay and this worked perfectly otherwise being permanently located in Colaba where the Taj is too far to fully explore the city as Juhu and other
"This hotel is truly beautiful.  Walking in from the chaos on the street in a stark contrast.  The hotel staff were very helpful and the accommodation was great.  Rooms are large and the butler service was very attentive.  The Gin and Tonic by the pool one afternoon was also memorable.  We had breakfast in the We ate at the Shamiana Restaurant a few times.  The Kathi rolls were good there.  We also had the traditional meal at the Shamiana and it was delicious. We also ate by the pool which was nice, room service was efficient and the Souk restaurant was probably the one we didn't like that much - waiters weren't that attentive and the food wasn't as good as other restaurants."
"We only had two nights in this gorgeous hotel and everything was perfect for us.   On arrival there is strict security and screening which was very comforting after the terrorist attack back in 2008.  There is a gorgeous waterfall in reception with the names of the people who lost their lives as a remembrance to that awful attack.   We stayed in the Palace side of the hotel and although had booked a sea view room, we were given a city room - we were told to take it up with our travel agent.   The room was comfortable, not over large but had everything we needed for a two night stay.   The swimming pool area is stunning and relaxing and we managed to spend an afternoon there after our tour.  The staff were all attentive and very friendly.  Would do anything to help.  The hotel"
"Stayed in the old wing of this over 100 year old hotel which has been modernized and  wonderfully maintained.  The rooms were very comfortable and offered up close views of the Gateway of India.  The food in the many restaurants was tasty, with a wide selection for the breakfast buffet.  Free Wi Fi.  There is a pool and a gym.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the service was excellent.  It was a very pleasurable experience spending two nights in this very charming hotel in an attractive location."
We went for celebrating our anniversary. They made the whole experience wonderful. We would never forget the room decorations and cake which was complementary. I would love to bring my whole family again.
"I found the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel to be exceptional. The staff, the food and the ambience were a breath of fresh air amidst the hustle of Mumbai. A true oasis! The best breakfast I have had anywhere! I would not hesitate to return. I recommend the Taj highly."
This is my fourth stay at the hotel and as expected the service was amazing. The hotel went above and beyond to make my 35 birthday a special memorable stay. I cannot fault how the hotel runs and operates. It is for this reason that every time I leave I think about when I will stay at the hotel next. Thankyou for such hospitality.
"the yard  with ..the pool make a  point ,calm place inside a crowded ....oh god the bathroom.....inside lobby the sculpture and space designs made me just feel beauty of the world..in fact i didnt got room there but i walked along lobby and by getting permit ion i could visit inside yard and bathroom..it was short time but worthless"
"We came to this iconic luxury property with very high expectations. I am happy to say that all our expectations were well met. The room was very comfortable, good size but still cozy, with a nice sea view. The historic part of the property is simply beautiful, and very well maintained. It is a real joy to walk up the grand staircase and along the corridors. The pool area is a nice oasis, and a good escape from the Colaba hustle on the other side of the wall. We enjoyed the Sea Lounge both for a night cap and the breakfast buffet, and it is hard to imagine a better setting for hotel breakfast. Since we were celebrating a big wedding anniversary, we also received some special attention in the form of cake, flowers, red balloons etc. Very well done Taj! I think we will come back"
"We stepped in to this beautiful hotel coming from the incredible peace and tranquility of Taj  Lake Palace in Udaipur.   When we arrived in this bustling city we were amazed at the beautiful exterior and large reception area.   We could hear loud music which was a party or a wedding on the roof.  We were quickly shown to our room on 15th floor.   It was clean, tidy , modern and functional albeit small.  After a tiring flight we decided to order food in the room which was delicious.   We decided to have an early night and put on TV although could still hear music at 11.   I assumed that there would be laws in India in terms of noise pollution and it would stop shortly.    It didn’t.....I eventually called reception about 2 am and was told the music volume would be turned down!!!!"
"Wen you enter the hotel, you feel worth, staying. Great view, facing the sea. Awesome service, cozy surroundings. Would definitely like to stay each time I visit Mumbai. Over a satisfying stay , with all the luxury"
"The staff were all excellent, attentive and courteous. Everyone we contacted looked after us very well. The breakfast buffet is great, especially the India specialties. Our suite was well appointed, comfortable and most attractive and spacious. Our only complaint was exterior construction noise (the hotel was working on its facade and seemed to be also installing electrical or other services) I would definitely recommend staying in the Palace Wing over the Tower if you enjoy antiques and historical architecture."
"Great location, the service was amazing, the staff will provide you with what you need and even more! The best food you'll ever find in Mumbai is in this hotel! My fav is shamina and masala kraft.. You have to try the aftetnoon tea at the sea lounge as well! Amazing amazing amazing!!"
"Firstly we were greeted on arrival, and then at reception by a beautiful lady Meghana Pitale who immediately made us feel very special by upgrading us to a suite from a standard room in the Tower Wing. This lady especially and all the other staff were magnificent. The service, the food, the amazing breakfasts were unbelievable. I felt like a Maharaja the way we were treated. We do not normally stay in such expensive hotels, but this was a special treat for us and we will never forget it and it was worth every Rupee. I wish I could have stayed longer and if ever I can go back, then I shall not hesitate. Only hope Meghana Pitale is still there. How come it is only 5 stars? did they run out? 10 out of 10"
"Having stayed at multiple Taj properties over the years, I certainly expected impeccable service (which is the TAJ way). What came as a very pleasant surprise was the attention to the smallest detail (which is also an Taj hallmark). Arriving after a 18 hour journey from NYC, I was greeted with such kindness and care that I felt like I was coming home. Each day continued in the same vein: faultless housekeeping (they left me shoe bags and perfumes sachets for my clothes), small touches  from housekeeping like shoe freshener lint cloth book mark.world class  service from housekeeping .tower newly renovated  room amazing.. delicious breakfasts, great bar, good gym and the most gracious, helpful and caring staff.special thank to Tusar housekeeping manager his care and empathy for"
"This is a very hyped hotel with lots of mythology around it, but I do think it lives up to all that hype. Staff are constantly surprising you in a good way with their service and the entire building is such a delightful place to be. The floors are crammed with museum-quality artefacts and the hotel is full of the most delightful smell. It is a truly beautiful place to be.  Our room was fairly basic, but very comfortable and housekeeping added little things to our room on a daily basis that were always very nice surprises.  Food in the restaurants is excellent, though can be eye-waveringly expensive even for 5* Mumbai.   The pool is superb and unusually deep. The shallow area is quite small and the pool quickly becomes deep. This is not a pool for children unless you are"
"By far the best hotel I’ve visited. The staff were unobtrusive, yet so helpful and considerate. For me, the best area was the outdoor pool and lounging area. It really was like a private palace. It is only accessible for guests which was a shame as we were back in Mumbai for a day and would have loved a high tea sitting on the wide verandah! There are many options for meals and we chose dinner in the lobby restaurant and breakfast up on the 19th floor. The view would have been amazing except for the smog! It is located across the road from the Gateway to India monument and the ferries to the islands. The flower arrangements are a sight to behold."
"We stayed here for two nights and it was a hard to beat experience. De staff is more than super, the room we had in the palace (not in the tower) was outstanding and the quality of the food is the best of the best. We felt like the king and the queen with a lot of servants to make our stay as pleasant as possible. They really succeeded is giving us two"" never to forget"" days!!"
"This is the first time I stayed in a hotel in Mumbai, having relocated  out of Mumbai after 40 years. So while I have visited Taj Mahal hotel numerous times over the years this was time I was staying at the hotel.  I have heard many overseas guests who stayed at the hotel talking effusively of the “old world” charm as well as personalised service of the hotel but this time I experienced it first stand. I stayed for 2 nights for business, though these days most guests are what in hotel parlance are called free itinerant or independent travellers ( on leisure) as business travellers have moved from south Mumbai to Mid-town and North Mumbai. Staying in Taj Mahal Palace wing, does give you feeling of staying in a palace even though the rooms have been fully modernised and are"
"Hotel has an amazing ambience. The cleanliness and the ambience give awesome feeling. The staff is very humble and would rate hospitality to excellent. Although the food served was very nice.This is one of the best hotels I have ever seen. The service is exceptional, the staff happily go above and beyond to make your stay..."
"We had high tea at this stunning hotel, it was a very special experience and for only 1950 rs per person. The setting was beautiful, lots of hot and cold food to choose from and so many cakes. An experience everyone should have."
Hotel has an amazing ambience. They maintain traditional outlook. The cleanliness and the ambience give awesome feeling. The staff is very humble and would rate  hospitality to excellent. Although the food served was very average and needs improvement.
"This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The service is exceptional, the staff happily go above and beyond to make your stay extra special.  My Friend and I were lucky enough to be upgraded on arrival, and we were able to indulge in the complimentary additions that this room had to offer, something we wouldn't usually be able to afford. It was the perfect end to our holiday."
"The hotel is an absolute gem in the center of old Mumbai. It is an authentic palace matching with the surroundings.  Service is amazing, so many restaurants to choose from, pool and spa.  The rooms are comfy, clean and luxurious. The price, put in euro or pound is absolutely decent for a palace I definitely encourage you to stay there."
"Hotel taj having restaurant for all who are staying in hotel or people who only come to experience luxury.... nice food ,wide range of variety and you can enjoy with your family and friends.... not too much costly must visit once if you plane to visit Mumbai "
"We booked the Maharajah High Tea at the Taj Hotel as a surprise for my wife's birthday, as we were staying in Mumbai at the time. When we called to make a reservation, Vinod Nair and his colleagues were very helpful and accommodating. We requested a table with a view of The Gateway of India and the sea and upon informing them that the booking was for my wife's birthday, Vinod arranged for a bouquet of flowers and a cake to be presented to my wife on the day. On arrival at the hotel, we were given a very warm welcome by the staff and were ushered to our reserved table by the window overlooking The Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea. The quality of the service and food was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed the Maharajah High Tea, as there was a wide selection of delicious"
"We cannot fault this hotel. Fantastic location, excellent attentive staff, spacious, modern rooms and a wonderful building.  Throughout our stay we were looked after exceptionally well. I cannot praise the staff enough. In every department they were dedicated, helpful, always happy and the attention to detail was outstanding.  Food in the hotel was also of a high standard with a number of restaurants to choose from. The pool area was also very good with a good size pool to swim in. Availability of sun beds was a slight issue when we were there but again the pool staff did all they could to ensure people were not booking beds etc. I cannot fault this hotel the building itself is also very ornate with a number of boutique shops inside. If I was ever to visit Mumbai again I would"
"For such an iconic property steeped in history there is an expectation of standards and service that surpass the ordinary, that even surpass normal 5 star levels of service - sadly the Taj Palace fails miserably on all fronts. Having spent 2 weeks in India at various top class hotels and having stayed at many iconic hotels all over the world, we were looking forward to 3 nights at the Taj in the Palace Heritage wing. We had booked 2 interconnecting grand luxury rooms with a view of the Gateway to India for ourselves and our son and took the trouble to confirm these could be provided before booking and twice subsequently to booking and ahead of travelling.  We arrived late on the first night of our stay and initially were surprised to be kept waiting in a vast Hiltonesque lobby"
"I love this hotel especially the swimming pool that has the maximum depth of 3 metres. We enjoyed staying in the beautiful rooms in the Palace section and also enjoyed high tea and happy hour drinks in the lounge. The hotel staff are all friendly and met the expectation of the Taj brand's service quality. I personally only wish that some staff did not obviously expect and keep waiting for tips all the time. People say this is India, but I felt more relax (in this particular matter) when staying at another Taj hotel - Vivanta by Taj in Delhi - where the staff did not seem to wait around for tips, like here. All in all, you will love this hotel."
We really enjoyed our stay at the Old Taj. Excellent property  - a combination of old world charm with modern amenities. It really lives up to its reputation and reviews and is truly one of a kind in India. 
"The splendour of the hotel is second to none, but the staff make it even better. They have  a commitment, dedication and attention that is ever present but not interfering. It reminded me of the Ritz in London. The Concierge was extremely helpful on so many occasions and out performed even the best. They organised a very good tour through to booking restaurants and organising delivery of packages to a local address for me. The rooms are not huge, and our room only had a (large) shower not a bath, but the quality and range of bathroom accessories was first class.The windows are double glazed but the ones on the front with the best view (of the Gate of India) you can hear that noisy Mumbai traffic in the background. Great location, great food in a number of different restaurants."
"I do not know any place/ anybody on earth after my parents that has pampered me this much. Hotel is a piece of heaven. You can not think about this hotel without the staff as they made me live the very best times of my life. Starting from the entrance to the hotel room, i felt like i am a princess. Everybody is so kind and helpfull. It was an amazing trip for us. Special thanks to housekeeping services, i love you all. The reception? Wuhuuuu they make you fly above the clouds. Thank you very much for everything Khushnood Ahmad. Will be back so sure in a very soon. Burcu Gergerlioglu- Huseyin Cahit Gergerlioglu"
"Probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Everything from the initial welcome with a cold drink and garland until checkout was perfect. We had a palace room overlooking the Gateway to India. It was spacious, well furnished with a supremely comfortable bed and efficient quiet aircon. Breakfast was excellent, as was the lunch we ate sitting by the gorgeous pool. What really made the stay special though was the staff, who anticipated our every need without being interfering. Every one was gracious, helpful, and a credit to the hotel.wish we could have stayed longer."
"We stayed for two nights after a tour of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Goa. We arrived straight off the overnight train looking disheveled and scruffy! The welcome was wonderful and genuine, we felt like celebrities not the messy pair we were! Obviously too early for check in we went to find the baggage store to be told check in would be fine - we were in the tower wing overlooking the gate (a bucket list item I can now cross off) The attention to detail and cleanliness not just in our room but everywhere was amazing. When learning it was our 25th wedding anniversary the staff gave us flowers and cake. Staying here was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I am so glad we did it, I cannot praise all the staff for everything they were so professional and friendly. We loved our stay."
"This is the finest hotel I’ve stayed in. Not only are the rooms plush and the restaurants amazing - but I’ve never seen this level of service anywhere.  Every employee goes out of their way to anticipate your needs and make your stay memorable.  I was here 3 nights and wish it had been a week.  If you can swing it, it’s worth staying in the Palace building for the opportunity to take breakfast in the Sea Lounge.  The view is gorgeous the the buffet was plentiful and well presented. If you book a club room, you’ll have access to high tea, evening cocktails and light bites and the night time cognac and chocolate service (as well as early check in and/or late check out). The 40 minute heritage tour of the property is worth taking but sign up early, it’s limited.  I didn’t use the"
"On our private tour of Bombay, while stopping to see the Gateway of India, our guide encouraged us to stop in to see the Taj Mahal Hotel.  We listened beforehand to our guide tell us information about the hotel and some of the past history. We thought the hotel was very beautiful and, of course, I loved the architecture, so proudly landmarking this important part of Bombay.  While highlighting Bombay, this is a must to see, even if you are not staying there, enjoy a visit with a photo stop."
"I was young, just out of college and only had enough in my budget to stay one night......but I have been cherishing that event for over 40 years!!! This return visit, I was able to afford 3 nights in a wonderful Gateway of India and ocean view room in the heritage wing.  Everything was superb! The Taj continues to live up to it's iconic reputation.......may it celebrate countless more decades.  "
"We were there for some event on 9-11th apr...rooms were nice but too small...equipped with most of the amenities... overall we had 5 major meals other than breakfast.... plus had two cocktail sessions...   Attitude issue - literally speaking it felt like a roadside restaurant have better customer sense than the so called TAJ MAHAL HOTEL... for a crowd of 300+ I have not seen more than 2 or 3 servers who are not able to walk even 10 steps with there trays as ppl were hungry... they stop serving as per there convenience. ..not enough cutlery for the guests(limited spoons)they care a damn even after so much escalations n requests...either highly under staff or they don’t bother  Food quality - If they claim to have the finest and best chef, then I think they are serving non-"
"The hotel and experience were everything I imagined it to be. I wish we could have stayed for longer, but other than the Masala Kraft, which is just an average restaurant, from the welcome to the departure, the staff, hotel and ambience were perfect."
"This hotel provides excellent comfort, safety and relaxation in the midst of the bustling Bombay streets. Overlooking the Arabian Sea, the room was spacious and clean. The food is also extremely good however I'd recommend eating out to experience the culture of the gateway."
"This hotel is stunning. Everything about it is superb, I would return here without a doubt. The staff, the food the ambiance, first time class. Lovely shops in the arcade although somewhat expensive, but certainly a visual treat. The hotel is located directly opposite the Gateway to India .  What an experience !"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a fabulous hotel overlooking the Arabian Sea and the Gateway to India! I had a wonderful experience here. Great hospitality and service.  My room was very clean, classy and spacious. Someone with whom I was travelling encountered a problem but staff seemed to take it seriously.   The pool area and garden were luxuriant. Common areas are also very nice. I ate at Souk, a top floor restaurant is the Taj Mahal Palace's more modern tower. The dining experience was fantastic.   I really enjoyed my stay at the Taj Mahal Palace."
"The Overall Experience was nice. The Staff at the hotel was very courteous. The food was good and ensured that it was served hot. There were various instances when I had needed some assistance, and the staff went out of the way to assist to provide and exceptional experience. The service provided was worth the money spend here."
"From the moment you enter its spacious lobby suffused with warmth of color and friendliness, you feel treasured and welcomed. No waiting in lines to check in; you are invited to sit and sip coffee/tea while the forms are prepared for your registration. Everyone smiles, and it's the most authentic welcome ever. Then you get to your room, where everything is elegant and hospitable. We took a photo with our Front Desk Executive, Meghana – we like to remember the names and faces of those who take care of us – and a copy was presented to us later that evening, framed. You are offered rose petal foot baths and every evening fresh flower patterns festoon the entry of your room...there seems to be no limit to how the Taj Palace and its lovely people can cherish you as a guest. Even the"
Stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in the Tower wing. Everything about the hotel is excellent.  The staff are very friendly and attentive. Hotel is spotless and rooms spacious. Breakfast is very good and the pool side restaurant has some great food. Loved the vegetarian lasagna!!!!  A good drive from the airport but worth it. We got an excellent rate as we were attending a conference so it was excellent value.
Stayed two nights at the Taj mahal Palace hotel. It is an iconic hotel and has a rich history. Building is well maintained despite being quite old. All the amenities are world class. Absolutely very high standard of upkeep. 
Great view of Arabian Sea And Near to the Gateway of India Good to visit . Amazing food Flavour . Olden Style hotel with awesome feature .Easy to reach Free parking Facility . Laundry service . Children friendly
"This was my first trip to the Taj Majal Palace in Mumbai and it was an outstanding visit.  From their meeting me at the airport just outside of baggage claim to their personally escorting me back to my flight leaving Mumbai - every experience with the Taj personnel is five star plus.  The staff of the Taj is the most friendly, helpful, even going out of their way to make my stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.  I stayed in the Heritage section of the Taj with its magnificent Colonial style yet every modern feature you can find in a hotel.  The room was spacious, the linens on the bed and pillows extremely fine, and the service outstanding - even down to the ornamental flowers arranged each morning on the marble entry way inside each room.  The breakfast buffet is"
"Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, this hotel is considered the flagship property of the group and contains 560 rooms and 44 suites. There are some 1,600 staff including 35 butlers. From a historical and architectural point of view, the two buildings that make up the hotel, the Taj Mahal Palace, and the Tower are two distinct buildings, built at different times and in different architectural designs. In 2017, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel has acquired an image trademark. It is the first building in the country to get intellectual property rights protection for its architectural design.  The hotel has hosted many notable guests, from presidents to captains of industry and stars of show business. "
115 year old iconic Hotel and the first Hotel with Electricity in India. The hospitality is top class. This stay is in my bucket list. The architecture and luxury is top of the world. The Hotel conducts a heritage walk and explain every thing. You have a personalise floor butler in this Hotel. Spacious room with luxurious wash room with bath tub. Room lighting is excellent  One should stay to enjoy the Taj hospitality 
We spent one night in this hotel which was amazing.  We stayed in the old part of the hotel (heritage wing) which is stunning and had breakfast by the pool in the morning.  I did yoga by the pool before eating.  This is a stunning hotel and I would recommend it if you are going to Mumbai.
"This is a must do, even only for one night. The hotel itself has a lot of history and the architecture is breathtaking. One can not fault the service and the facilities are second to none. Breakfast was delicious and there was a wide variety of dishes from across the world.  Rithun Ail was particularly very hospitable and helpful during our stay. This is definitely one of the best hotels I have stayed in and will definitely be going back."
"This is probably my favourite hotel in the world. It's uniquely Indian and Mumbai, it wears its heritage/legacy/history so well but at the same time is very contemporary. Special mention to the beautiful pool and location at India Gate. But the welcome and service and genuine nature of every single staff member is what makes it extra special. "
"Endless beauty and hospitality. This is the nearest you can come perfection. We have stayed in quite a few good hotels, but this is without comparison the most comfortable, beautiful hotel ever experienced. Despite all the beauty that meets your eyes, it would not be worth anything if it had not been for the professional, yet charming and helpful staff!"
"Since the heavy damage the hotel received in 2008 Terrorist attack it is now back to it's very best and you would never be aware of that terrible time apart from the heavy security to enter the hotel.  As a family we took two rooms in the Palace Wing overlooking the pool area - Good bedroom, comfortable bed and modern bathroom with separate shower and inviting bath.  If nothing else the one thing we will remember is the excellent service from the people who looked after the rooms. Cleaned twice daily and a different surprise each day. The willingness to please follows through the hotel with friendly staff in the restaurants.  The outside verandah is attractive in a colonial way to relax have drinks and even eat.   Beer and wine seem to be excessively expensive for what it is and"
"This hotel has the most attentive staff, very comfortable beds and is walking distance from some major sights. The one colleague that really stood out is Harinder who checked us into the room at 4am in the morning. Highly recommended and will definitely be back!"
"We stayed on the 16th floor of the tower block with a magnificent view out over the Gateway to India and the Indian Ocean. Our room was lovely with lots of space, a comfy bed and the great view.  We also had access to the magnificent older part of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.  The complex is amazing, we took advantage of the lovely central courtyard, the pool and the restaurant in the gardens and also had a lovely meal in the Indian Restaurant on our last night in India.  A very special place with delightful staff, amazing breakfasts and great service.  Can't fault it and would love to stay again!"
"If you stay in the main luxurious section of the hotel, it is truly DIVINE with the most amazing rooms and artwork along the walls, like being in an art museum. The restaurants and breakfasts are expensive but incredible...delicious. We stayed in the tower one night and it was pretty nasty with the smell of mildew and a bad view with bars on the window like a prison. It really needs an upgrade. Overall, a nice historic property with solid heightened security since the bombings.You feel absolutely safe being there and well taken care of. "
"Iconic hotel, facing the India Gate.  Mesmerising views from the Tower rooms, a more modern but equally lovely addition to the original hotel.  The staff are wonderful, helpful. You can move between the original hotel and tower via the corridor with designer shopping. The pool and bar area also sell snacks drinks and bbq. The Tower restaurant serves huge buffet breakfast with infinite possibilities for all palates.  Nice touch from housekeeping, some bangles, earrings and scarf left as a gift, and bookmarks. We hired a hotel driver for 4hours ho drove us around the sights of Mumbai. Kumar was brilliant, giving us information, and time for photo stops,  Looking after us so well "
"Visiting India recently we decided to go to Mumbai primarily because we wanted to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace. Knowing of the hotel by its reputation, we really wanted to see if it as good as it is said and what it would be like to stay there. It is better!  From the very arrival at the hotel we were made incredibly welcome. We had chosen to stay in the main palace rather than the tower and the check-in was swift and efficient whilst being friendly too. Our room was spotless and pristine and the view of the Gateway to India and the harbour was amazing!  We ate at the poolside barbecue on our first evening which was amazing! It was a fantastic meal and the service was second to none. On another evening we ate in the Shamiana restaurant which was also exceptional.  On our last"
"For the price you can take the building room with sea view. It's in front of ""gate of India "" amazing . Service is  the best . Facilities are the best . Decoration is assume  . One of the best hotel in world. "
I must confess to not going inside this building although we had a good look around outside. I think the history of the building of the hotel is quite amazing.  After a wealthy Indian businessman (Tata was his name I understand )  was not allowed in to his own conference at another hotel because he was not white he built this amazing monumental hotel to get back at them.  Wow. A beautiful building 
"We stayed 5 days and 3 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace, enough for a good assessment. The location is perfect, next door to the India Gateway, on the seafront.  The building, the old one – not the Tower - is magnificent. The furniture and decoration are outstanding. It is a pain that the service is not up to the level. The staff is numerous, but obviously not adequately trained, and sometimes of a questionable English fluency. The service in most of the restaurants, at least at the Sea Lounge, the Aquarius, the Shamiana, and the Souk, was abnormally slow.  For the breakfast, even when the salon was not crowded, we had to wait 10 to 15 minutes to get a cup, or a pot of tea. The menus are quite limited, and the lunch buffet at the Shamina, was not what you should expect. We saw the"
"We had seen good reviews of the Taj online, and also watched a UK TV program about the hotel, but we really were pleasantly surprised by quite how good the hotel actually was. We live in Dubai and are used to the high levels of service that UAE hotels offer, but the Taj surpassed everything we have stayed in and also was significantly superior to the other hotel we stayed in whilst in Mumbai. Special thanks to Sabnam Shah, Sayonika Das and Vaibhav Sangle who all went the extra mile to make our stay extra special....  We can’t wait to stay there again at the end of our holiday!"
"It is just located right by the Gateway of INDIA.  It is in Colaba, end land of Mumbai. It is very famous for his luxury and hospitality.  Mostly  Top class people are coming here. My friends they stayed here. Fantastic stay and experiences ."
"Services are beyond 5 stars from the reception to room service to restaurants and everything else  I Loved this hotel. The service here is outstanding.Staff are professional , respectful and so friendly !The pool area is in the iconic Palace part of the hotel & is absolutely gorgeous."
Best place for evening timing which provides a beautiful view of Arabian Sea and city. Customer service is beyond expectation and I went to celebrate my hubby's bday so post our dinner they provided a complimentary cake which is usual in good restaurants but the thought to share. Had Lebanese food and was good.
"Extremely security conscious and with good reason.  The friendliest staff make sure no matter where you go or what you do, someone actually cares that your stay is perfect.  We had a lovely suite and were celebrating our anniversary.  The hotel put roses in the room and lovely heart shaped balloons to help us celebrate.  The butler took care of all of our needs and we had a fantastic stay.  We wish we had stayed longer.  The location is perfect, the choice of dining is magnificent, the bar is fantastic and most important, the people will take the best care of all your needs.  Thank you to Mr. Singh and all the staff for a perfect experience."
The hotel is 100% luxury and a total escape from the outside world .We can not fault the hotel or the staff . The only part of the hotel system we were disappointed in was the booking staff that were not interested in explaining the hotels position truthfully .
"The Taj is probably the most legandary hotel in India. It is located right by the Gateway to India in Colaba. The hotel pool is incredible and the gym is huge and you can have yoga or fitness instruction. There is also a lovely spa. There are a large number of restaurants to choose from. I went to the first floor modern wing restaurant for breakfast, where there was an incredible buffet and a lovely modern ambience. I also had cake and coffee and then drinks at the sea lounge which overlooks the harbor and is fantastic with the loveliest staff, who gave me a table overlooking the harbor. The palace wing where I stayed is gorgeous with beautiful antiques and craft objects throughout the floor. The rooms are great with beautiful bathrooms, and wonderful service. Next time I would"
"Our family of 4 adults travelling the 'Golden Triangle' in India stayed for 2 nights in the Taj Mahal Palace Tower Wing which is modern, light, elegant, buzzy and functional in contrast to the original amazing, stunning Taj Mahal Palace building; we were so thrilled to be here. However, mostly all amenities are available for all guests in both buildings. On arrival we were told that we were unable to have our interconnecting rooms as requested, but then this was soon resolved and with an upgrade, which was greatly appreciated! The service and attention to detail throughout is excellent. A special mention of thanks to members in the Aquarius restaurant manager Arkshay, and chefs Sanjit and Sandeep who cook a sublime spaghetti Aglio di Olio, so impressed that we all ate this both"
"We had our partners meeting at this wonderful hotel, unfortunately stuck in the meeting rooms for three days, albeit beautiful rooms.  Stunning pool area, unfortunately half a day is all we had, the service was wonderful  The bedroom was lovely, a little on the small side but one should remember that we were in the old wing of the hotel, which is stunning.  Certainly I would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel over the Oberoi Mumbai which I had stayed previously."
"With respect to location and a historical perspective this is the place to stay. However, our room was extremely disappointing in that the humidity and musty odor Was terrible. Our clothes in the closet were damp and it was quite unpleasant. When this was addressed to the staff, one assured us that the cleaning staff would freshen it up, ultimately we were told that it was simply a very old hotel and nothing could be done....I again mentioned this upon checkout only to be told I should have complained and they would have given us another room???"
"This is truely one of the most iconic and splendid hotels in Mumbai and definitely worth the experience at least once.   We had a basic standard room and stayed for two nights. The rooms are palatial and even though I wasn’t feeling very well, the setup helped not get me down.   We had room service which comes with extras such as bread and finger bowls.   The turn down service adds the little extra touches such as a glasses cleaner, wraps your mobile phone charger up, ensuring there is plenty of water for you and a little treat (fruit and chocolates) before you go to bed.   We ate at what was billed the meditearraen restuarant which we thought was more middle eastern. The chicken sharwma was to die for.   Had the signature cocktail at the Harbour bar which came with the usual"
"This is just such a superb iconic hotel to stay in. The staff are exemplary and service is excellent in an iconic building that exudes comfort. Would I recommend? Absolutely would I return? ASAP   The restaurants of which we tried three are also excellent. Ie the Mediterranean, Chinese, pool side.   Make sure to get a room with a view of India gate or the sea. "
"We splurged for the sea view palace room and don't regret it.  Feel like a pasha coming back to this place after a day in Mumbai.  Some parts are new, but there is still enough history to appreciate.  Best sheets ever."
"All team members were so welcoming, and sincerely interested in serving us. We dined in several hotel restaurants and found them to be excellent. The hotel has a great health club and pool area. The views of the harbor were added value. The public space was very clean and well maintained."
"As soon as you enter the hotel you are overwhelmed by the aromatic jasmine scent and beautiful flower arrangements. This is extremely large and busy hotel, but well maintained with plenty of staff to fulfill their guests every wish. Still be prepared to wait for the concierge assistance, because they are always busy. Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. Palace part of the hotel is much nicer than the Tower and staying in Palace includes additional services such as afternoon tea and pre dinner cocktails. We didn't have time to try the cocktails, but Afternoon tea was great with variety of hot drinks and small dishes to choose from. Breakfast was amazing when we had it the Palace, but one morning we made a mistake and went to the Tower restaurant for breakfast because we"
It seems that the staff have changed and so have the approach. Indians are made to feel unwanted in view of the visits of Dignitaries from all over the world. Before a couple of years the experience was different and we had decided to visit the hotel again. But this time it seems that the hotel is keen on receiving Dignitaries than Domestic customers and the approach of the executives has changed. However the Hotel is the CROWN of Mumbai situate opposite the Gateway of India. The Ambience and maintenance of the interiors and the rooms are second to none. The food is delicious and the staff takes care in the hotels maintenance. Housekeeping and room service are always ready to serve with a smile.
We have experienced afternoon tea around the world and this was unique in that it was more like a hot & cold buffet as well as  the usual cakes & sandwiches served in a wonderful room. We took the opportunity to look around the hotel which was magnificent and the rooms were not that expensive.
It's all been said - this is a beautiful hotel on the sea front in Mumbai. A landmark and must-visit hotel.  Public spaces are as spotless and classic as they are beautiful and peaceful. Will come again and stay next time. 
"We stayed in the palace wing and our room overlooked the gateway to India. The Tom and view were spectacular. Could not find anything not to like about this hotel. Staff excellent. Rooms spacious, clean and comfotable. We had drinks in the Palace lounge in the evening which was very nice,  Breakfast was amazing. A few nice boutiques in the hotel if you want to avoid the hustle and bustle.  Try this hotel it is wonderful."
"From the moment I arrived to the minute I checked out I was transported to another world, a world of days gone by where luxury abounds and time stands still. I stayed in a sea facing room in the original part of the hotel and all I can say is WOW. They have thought of everything, and then some. And while I was there I popped down to the spa for a pedicure - a royal treat indeed."
"Absolutely outstanding. Worth every single rupee. We stayed for four nights in the palace wing which is stunning. The rooms are luxurious and each day we’d excitedly opened the door to see what tiny gift had been left!!!   Wonderful smiling staff who could not do enough for you. Amazing breakfast overlooking the gate of India. The pool area is a joy, including the constant delivery of cold water and chilled towels.   The booking included a few extras such as high tea, late afternoon cocktails and evening cognac and chocolates which I wasn’t clearly informed of on arrival but discovered later and availed of. We also loved the hotel tour however were not advised we had to prebook a time but were accommodated on arrival one evening.   None of this detracted from the stay. We loved,"
"Well this hotel doesn’t disappoint in anyway, beautiful building, amazing staff and fabulous food. We really enjoyed our stay here and it was a great place to start our holiday in Southern India. The team cannot do enough to help you and are so nice and a big thanks to you all. Highly recommended if you going to Mumbai and fancy a little pampering. "
Spending money in India is difficult- either you soend little for tatsy things or a bit more for great things...   Business hotels are expensive so why not spend a little more and stay at the famous Taj Palce near the Gate of India..  We did and did not regret it!!! Make sure you dont stay in the Taj Palace Towers but the traditilnal one.  Gate of India 2 mins walk. 
"Stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace towers in Mumbai. I can only say this is customer service at its best. Additionally, location is amazing, food quality and taste is exceptional and it is one of the finest hotels i have stayed in. When you leave your charging cables for your iphones loose and you come back to find them all tide up neatly with zip ties and put where they belong. This is exceptional service. When you don't have to even stop by the reception desk to check in and all they escort you to your room to do all check in procedures in the comfort of your quarters, this is outstanding service.  Well done!"
This hotel is the best. Awsome services. I love this place Good service offered by them and I love this hotel so much.i love it This hotel is awsome and best hotel in India. They offered good service. 
"Great experience as always. Percy the head waiter has been extremely kind to my son, accommodating young child in such a high style location. Great tea and coffee, perfect view of the sea. Highly recommended. "
"Beautiful Lobby, Charming Front Office & the Staff The rooms aren't as grand as the HOTEL itself, particularly Bathrooms, mine had a risen tub(couple of steps to climb),extremely inconvenient & one can see an imminent fall, if not taken care while taking a shower...Would have also loved an alternate to paper tissues at WC. B/F & Quality of Food Excellent."
"I have just spent 13 nights at this hotel, and I think it is my fourth or fifth visit.  I have no  complaints.  The staff are extremely polite and willing to help if you have a problem that needs solving.  I stayed on the Club Floor which is well appointed.  The Club room downstairs has improved vastly since my previous visit, and the current team work well together.   This is an iconic building which surprisingly does not appear to suffer from maintenance issues.  The pool is large, has a deep end, and again is very well maintained.  As far as the restaurants are concerned, we found the Chinese restaurant to be well above average and it exceeded all expectations."
"Suggest if you are looking for some good comfort in style and it be luxurious , opt for the rooms in the palace wing and not the tower block .... though this hotel has various rates offered against various room categories and even for rooms that face the sea , which in my words is not a fair practic indeed ... especially never to offer iot from VIP guests and Platinum Guests ! The entire hotel is clean and neat with friendly staffs some who are real professionals while few aren’t and may mess up your day or in giving a correct feedback .  The choice of restaurants is truly amazing , hence plan your day as to which and what kind of food you would opt for and block the table ... while my strong recommendation is not to give a miss to one of the finest lounge in Mumbai called the"
The first business trip where I wished I was on holiday! The hotel is beautiful and the staff are Super helpful.   The rooms are very clean and well decorated. My room had a view of the gate which was stunning.  The spa was nice. I had a massage but it wasn’t great considering the price.  The gym on the other ha d was better than some ‘paid for gyms’ I have used in past!
Iconic hotel which on our visit it certainly exceeded expectations. Security to access the hotel is extremely tight for obvious reasons but the hotel has managed to integrate even this process into the whole Taj experience with staff who smile are friendly and genuinely seem pleased to welcome you to the premises even though they are doing a serious and important job. Our room on the second floor of the palace wing was wonderful. Very comfortable with quality but understated furnishings and we slept soundly which was just as well given some of our early starts. All the staff are attentive but not intrusive and the hotel has a wide range of restaurants which means you can enjoy pizza and fries or splash out and treat yourself to wonderfully presented and tasty Chinese or Japanese
"The Taj Mahal Palace is A 5 Star Luxury Hotel Which is located in Mumbai Town, Apollo, Colaba Opposite Arabian Sea And Gateway Of India  This Hotel Has Best Restaurant Like Souk, Masala Bay, Shamiana And Specially Starbucks Inside it at the back entrance of the Hotel along with few Shopping Facilities In It.

"wish i could rate this with even more stars.  each guest is treated like royalty.  so many, many special touches for us as we celebrated our fiftieth anniversary - arrive to a room filled with red heart shaped balloons, rose petals on the bed along with beautiful red_heart pillows!  and more and more!"
"I stayed in the hotel in November 2017 for five days on business and used their conference rooms for our event. The hotel is centrally located and overlook The Gateway of India. I stayed in the Tower rooms which are more contemporary in design but are beautifully appointed with very comfortable beds.  The hotel staff are great, friendly and very accommodating.  I love the welcome and the personalised check-in on arrival.  They have a variety of restaurants but I like Wasabi and the Chinese restaurant.  These are the two that I've tried aside from the all day dining restaurant for breakfast. I had a great stay at the hotel."
"We stayed in the modern tower part. The large room had a view of the Gateway of India and was superbly equipped. It should be for the price, of course, but the great thing about the Taj group is that the staff are attentive without being obsequious (i.e. over-doing it). I recommend booking onto the 'heritage tour' so that you can see the ballroom, the main staircase (with bust of Mr Tata) and other original parts (which had to be restored after the outrageous attack in 2008). It is delightful to have breakfast by the pool, which is in an enclosed garden like a cloister. The only downside was the queue to get through security at the entrance - but sadly that is necessary these days."
We started our trip in Mumbai and on arrival we were upgraded to a lovely room with view overlooking the harbour and Gateway to India. The room was beautiful with plenty of space for sitting and relaxing. Staff throughout were superb and always keen to help. Security was excellent and very reassuring. A really beautiful hotel.
"Booked a couple of rooms with friends to celebrate a birthday. I had an amex voucher which I used and got a city facing room as it was for one night only. Budget time I guess. When I reached the room I reached out to the phone and requested if they could give me a sea facing room. To my surprise they obliged and swiftly transferred me to the sea facing tower room. Then I requested that it was my friends birthday and they made our night one we would never forget. So from celebrating one birthday in the Yacht to the midnight in the taj with chocolates, balloons, cakes, biscuits. All of us felt very special and I guess Taj is one of the best hotels in India. Top class service, top class Hospitality. "
We stayed for 2 nights at Taj. This stay was just for an experience. We heard so much about Taj. They really made it special for us. Here are few pics...We booked sea facing room. Room was nice with a view of Mumbai’s busy life. Good eating places and cafes around. If you are into street shopping then Kolaba market is the place. the market is just behind the hotel. You can pick souvenirs for family and friends. Overall heavily recommended!! Thanks to hotel staff!! 
"Whilst staying at the Heritage village for 2 weeks we decided to visit Mumbai. Caught a flight and was there in no time.Had a guide called Siddhi , I have lost his card but his company may be called dreams. He was fantastic and took us to all the main attractions including the Taj hotel which overlooks the sea and near to the passage of India. Beautiful area with lots to see. A must visit. "
"What a welcome to India on our first day. We stayed in the tower wing with a fantastic view of the Gateway of India. Everything one could possibly want in the room. Service and food in the cafe was good, with a choice of “low spice” just to ease the digestive system to India. Highly recommended as a treat but don’t forget how the real Mumbai lives. "
Top class hotel - all you’d expect and more.  Not cheap but worth every penny. Staff are all superb and the flower displays throughout the hotel are simply stunning. Check out the Harbour Bar for great cocktails - if your favourite is not on the list the expert mixologist bar man will happily make it for you.
"We stayed here for two nights at the end of a 3 week tour of India.  The hotel is incredible - it has style, luxury and a true heart to Mumbai.  The room we stayed in was in the old palace wing and was fabulous with views over the sea and Gateway to India - magical.   The service was generally excellent and the staff only to eager to help. In the 1st floor restaurant however, it was sometime difficult to get the staffs attention - they seemed a little aloof at times compared with some of the other luxury hotels we hav stayed in in India.  As has been mentioned the rooms do smell faintly of damp - but this is doesn’t spoil the experience.    One thing to be aware of is the noise at night - if you are on the front of the hotel at weekends it does seem to be a place where people"
"The staff at the Taj Mumbai is lovely. I mentioned that I was travelling with a friend for my 60th birthday and upon my return to my room I found balloons, cake and roses. The staff at the front desk made my first trip to India very memorable."
"Cons: Although I emailed them for an airport pick up and got a confirmation, they forgot to arrange a car for us so we had to wait at the airport in such chaos, call them and wait for them to arrange a backup car. Not what one wants to do after a long flight at 5 a.m.  They have a big humidity problem both at the tower and palace wing. We stayed at the palace wing and the rooms smelled like a humid basement and beds were moist. Quite disappointing.  Egg dishes at breakfast is just not really up to standard.    Pros: Staff is friendly and they try to help in every way they can.   Make sure you try the barbecue by the pool at least one evening.   The general feeling is very grand.  Every evening the girls from staff light the oil lamps by the pool exit of the palace wing with a"
"I couldn't recommend this hotel more highly - everything from the staff (thanks Rahul for looking after us so generously), for whom nothing is too much trouble. To the aesthetics and design of the hotel (to die for), to the beautiful facilities including restaurants, bars, high tea salon, swimming pool, spa.. everything feels special and all the small details have been considered and executed perfectly. In addition our check-in and welcome ceremony were delightful (i wish i could remember the ladies name). As someone who travels regularly around the world, it is rare to gush this much but i can genuinely say i don't think i have ever had a nicer hotel experience from start to finish. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the signature suites which was the incing on the cake to"
"Our stay at the iconic Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai was a bucket list ambition. I'd been to the hotel many times over the years for meals and drinks but had never stayed there. This visit was to celebrate a big birthday later this year and it certainly didn't disappoint. We were there for four nights during which time we were pampered and cossetted  every step of the way, made to feel very special by each and every member of staff. Breakfast near the pool was a particular highlight, staff there anticipating  our every need, uncannily at times! It is undoubtedly a beautiful hotel, old school luxury and grace at its best. Location, too, is second to none.  Biggest bargain at the Taj is the afternoon tea buffet in the Palace Lounge...very yummy indeed for around 850 rupees...."
One of the best hotels located in South Mumbai. It's a treat to stay at Taj and this one was special as we were able to stay in the 103years old Taj palace. The interiors have still been preserved and there is a tour conducted for the palace residents to know about the hotels history and story. Overall experience wad brilliant! Highly recommended.
This was our third time at the taj and it is allways a pleasure to stay here everything from the moment you arrive to leave is magical!! The staff are so helpfull and the grounds are stunning ! We also used the spa for the first time on this visit and had an amazing massage ! Suprisingly was very reasonable !! We has a sea view room in the palace and had views directed at the gateway of india a truly amazing sight at sunset !! Will definately be returning and staying again !!! 10 stars would not be enough ! 
High Tea at the Sea Lounge - wonderful experience and a beautiful view. So much food!! Room was beautiful as was the presentation. The Indian street food was delicious but so filling. Masala tea was also delicious.
The last time my wife and i stayed at The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai was for One night and for my 50th Birthday back in 2015 and it just wasn't long enough. and we both agreed when we next came to Mumbai we would stay here again but for that bit longer. We availed ourselves the Hotel's car service both to and from Mumbai Airport and it was well worth the time and money for what were impecable and seamless transfers. on our arrival we were greeted by  Ninad Bhosle  of the Front Office team  (Thank you Ninad for your genuine and very warm welcome to both Anina and myself) and given a traditional Indian welcome to the hotel and then taken onwards to our room where Ninad  explained everything to us. i had initially requested Room 1706 again as we had stayed in this room in the Tower
"When planning our first trip to Mumbai, I knew that there was no other option than to stay at the Taj in the Palace wing - and it was beyond expectations! We had the Neptune suite, a beautiful collection of rooms with a screened porch and spectacular view of the Gateway of India and the bay beyond. Our night butler told us that it is his favorite suite in the entire hotel. It was well-worth staying in the Palace wing, which is the original historic part of the hotel. The Grand Staircase is a sight to behold, as are the corridors, and fabulous public spaces. Being a swimmer, I very much enjoyed the pool, which is spacious and probably at least 25M long.   Within our suite, we had all of the modern conveniences one would expect, but with the charm and elegance of a grand hotel"
"I have stayed here twice now and loved both experiences.  The team is friendly and goes the extra mile to ensure a pleasant stay.  I stayed in Club Rooms in the Palace each time and the rooms are lovely, as is that wing of the hotel.  The food was great in each location - breakfast in the sea lounge, the poolside cafe, and dinner in Wasabi.  The spa was enjoyable and the pool is a pleasant respite within Colaba.  In each stay the staff accommodated special requests from me.  I look forward to going back again!"
"Great selection of food , great service , very attentive , enjoy the election of tea , nice atmosphere , if what to indulge yourself do try Afternoon high tea . If your in Mumbai you must visit the Taj ."
"Superb, relaxed, comfortable environment and staff amid the bustle and drama of Mumbai. The Club Room whilst not exceptionally spacious, was complete and very comfortable. The Club Services team were as close to perfect hosts as one could wish for. The Club hours aren't overtly generous and there is no Indian cuisine available during the cocktail session, but that minor criticism aired, we had fun and enjoyed our stay tremendously."
"We went to Mumbai for a couple of days while staying in Goa, we were staying at a different hotel while in Mumbai but wanted to visit the Taj Mahal Palace hotel while there, so we booked for lunch, the dining experience was lovely the food was excellent and the staff were very good, It was such a relaxing atmosphere, after lunch we walked through the lower floors to the shopping mal , this was brilliant , would like to visit again sometime and stop here,  Paul and Julie Jones"
"Service is attentive and friendly from the moment you check in and the blessing is a nice touch . It’s a large grand hotel and the public areas and restaurants reflect this . We ate at Souk that had a huge Middle eastern menu ; complimentary dips were fresh and tasty and refreshed during our meal , portions were large and the food very good but prices especially for meat are pretty steep even for 5 start luxury ( 2 starters and reasonable mains , wine and gin and tonic about 14000 rupees ) The facilities come at a price . Good wine list with some reasonable value Indian wines that have been well chosen . Breakfast is very good in the modern restaurant , with loads of choice ,and well cooked food to order alongside the buffet . There are also great restaurants in walking distance"
"We'd been looking forward to staying here for a long time and it lived up to our expectations.  Lovely greeting and characterful room with stunning views (Luxury Grand Sea View).  The public areas were as beautiful as we expected. We found housekeeping to be exceptional with many special small touches and the location of the hotel is perfect. (Many sights/museums/restaurants within easy walking distance although crossing roads in India was a learning experience for us!).  The food was excellent although we did not sample the fine dining restaurants.  We would not stay anywhere else in Mumbai and look forward to returning soon.  The only comments I would make would be that as previous reviewers have noted, breakfast can be slightly chaotic - on the first day we were seated and"
"Booked this hotel as soon as we booked our flights to Mumbai for the start of our 3 weeks trip to India as this was one place I absolutely wanted to experience . I definitely wanted to stay here as seen documentaries on it and somewhat of a Mumbai place to be. I knew it was 5 star and based on the behind the scenes work that goes on , was expecting to be wowed....  Arrival was good - we arrived at 2am and the staff ( from the doormen and security through to receptionists) was very welcoming. We had a traditional Hindu welcome with bindi and a blessing ..very nice touch. We were shown to our room after a very quick check in and room was nice and decent size. We had a luxury sea view room in the main palace and it was very close to the Gateway of India !   After that I spotted"
"I was looking forward to our stay at this iconic hotel, The Taj Mahal Palace as the cherry that would top our Indian trip on our way out from Mumbai. While the hotel boasts grandeur, and promises “An Experience of Excellence” in a “House of Firsts,” it lacks compassion!  As I went this morning (2nd day post arrival) to the reception to notify them that I have been charged twice for my entire stay on my credit card. The lady informed me with a forced smile that there is a difference between being charged and an amount being blocked on the card, and that yes there was a mistake of double blocking the full amount which will only be cleared upon check-out. While I know that there is a difference between blocking and charging I informed her that the “extra” amount of an entire"
"I stayed here before, compared to my last stay this time it was crazy busy at the hotel!  Of course because of the landmark status of this hotel there are a lot of none guest wandering around the lobby and restaurant just to take pictures.  If you want a relaxed quiet stay, avoid the lobby area.  Great cocktails in the bar (but expensive)"
"my friend are enjoying to much and i will be very happy to stay there  very promptly staff  also  specially thanks to all f&b staff  also house keeping staff are excellent ,,, best hospitality manage by group and all staff"
"booked in for our anniversary and wifes birthday and have to say it is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in the suite upgrade was fantastic and the amount of apologies we got for the cockroach was way over the top  everything about the hotel was top class service, food ,cleanliness  our frustrations came about from communication ,my wife asked three different members of staff about the afternoon tea and each time was told that it was the same service in each restaurant, this is not the case but found out only after taking tea in the ground floor palace lounge . we then came to checkout and this can be done in room we were presented with a bill that amounted to just £80 this was ok but when i asked what the items were we were being charged for they didnt know so off we"
"Fantastic hotel which pampers to your every need, last time I stayed the main hotel had just suffered the terrorist attack and was still shut so I stayed in the tower, refurbished main hotel is fabulous it looks and feels colonial. Ate at the Indian restaurant which was OK, then at the Chinese which was great, I then went to the bar / club which was good. Rooms, pool area and staff were outstanding, highly recommended."
Be careful to lock your door when you are inside. A house keeping guy entered the room at 6.30am without knocking when we were fast asleep saying he thought it was check-out time. There was no cookies / fresh fruit in the roomr no welcome drink. We were refused the heritage walk saying there were insufficient headphones! I felt like Indians were neglected in the hotel built by JRD as an object of Indian pride. 
"Staying the the original hotel is truly a step to the past with luxury.  The rooms have been updated while keeping with the original feeling of the structure  We enjoyed the ""club"" room, located on the main floor and again, an ""antique"" experience with elegance.  We booked the ""old"" hotel to experience the Gate to India's view and were rewarded.  The modern tower is a different experience for those who want modern and views from on high.  We started in one of the tower rooms and it was really really well done, but we chose to ask to be moved to our original reservation and the fine staff were able to do a middle of the night turn around to comply with our wishes.  Frankly we would have very been happy in the tower as these are very nice indeed, but we like to live in the"
"Taj : Undoubtedly the best hotel to stay in Mumbai. after so many years they have still maintained their standard , they really know what is guest comfort. the old wing is better than the new wing . Lot of restaurants  with different cuisine , shopping with in the hotel is also good."
"This hotel is one of the legendary in the world. It has a quiet elegance to it, particularly if you have a room in the old section. I would have given it 5 stars but it can be hectic during peak tourist season, so finding a seat for breakfast or a spot by the amazing pool can be an issue. Hang out in the lobby in the evenings to see the best dressed and bejeweled locals arrive for the parties."
"Excellent buffet lunch with family and friends. One of the best in all Taj hotels in Mumbai. The spread of food, beverages, desserts is huge face_savoring_foodface_savoring_food  Approx expense per person around 3000-3500 for veg buffet."
"Stayed at the Taj on 14th February, 2018. A bit of awe always when you enter it  but then there are smiles which touch the eyes to greet you. immediately the comfortable feel and one gets ensconced in the Taj experience. Wonderful rooms, service and a lot of activity happening all the time. It is a huge place and the palace rooms are a walk through the corridors. The restaurant is busy even at midnight and the breakfast time is a melee...but all this in that comfortable way.  The service is very warm and in a very understated way. Class is written all over this. This busy place profuse with lazy elegance is an ideal stay at the gateway to the hustle bustle city that is Mumbai."
"This hotel is expensive.  We stayed in the tower section and requested a view of the historic India Gate.  We could not have been happier.  The view was great. The staff are extremely professional (as you would expect for the price you are paying).  The location was great for walking around and we actually never left that particular area of the city.  There were shops, restaurants and things to see all within walking distance.  The hotel was so nice that we wished we had saved Mumbai until our last stop on our India voyage because nothing else quite measured up to the experience.  The hotel has a great swimming pool located in the palace area of the hotel and offered free morning yoga classes.  They also offer a hotel tour as well every afternoon, but you need to sign up in"
Only three nights out of a six week trip through South India and Sri Lanka and it is the Taj that I long to see again.  It's a fantasy from the moment you enter the fragrant lobby and that spell is never broken.  Our room in the Tower was beautiful and comfortable.  We were thrilled to be able to book a room there just two nights before New Years Eve and watching Mumbai celebrate the New Year from the 17th floor was an unforgettable experience.  The historical importance of the Taj infuses every corner and the lobbies are world-class people watching experiences.   Magnificent way to start the New Year.
"We nipped in for a little wander round the Palace, thru the extravagant corridors and did a bit of window shopping.  It certainly is an awesome venue, obviously fantastic views of the Gateway and a good location for Mumbai, all very secure but very extravagant too, so be prepared to break the bank if you fancy a cup of tea or a snack!"
"Great 3day stay , great service, it doesn't get much better than this. Every little detail is covered by the welcoming staff, lovely pool , superb breakfast what more could you want, most certainly will return."
"The service is tremendous, the place is beautiful and everything is just right.  Perfect example.  Went to the health club to work out and came back to my room.  Within 5 minutes someone was at my door with a cool glass of tea to refresh me. How did they know to come up at that exact time? Just one example of how they handle guests and make them feel welcome.  Clearly best place in Mumbai and one of the top in the world as I've stayed in numerous top 50 places."
"From airport arrival to departure, my stay was smooth, attentive, efficient, friendly and faultless.  For such a large hotel, it is remarkable that such a personal level of service can be achieved.  My name was remembered at each breakfast and my table and meal choice recorded ech evening in the Marsala restaurant."
"Had been meaning to visit this flagship hotel for years. Finally now retired and with time on our hands we had the opportunity to do so. Not an auspicious start-- our flight from Dubai was delayed and extensive queues at the e-visa gates meant we did not arrive at the hotel till 03.30 hours!! We had booked an Executive Club room but they upgraded us to a suite which was an unexpected and welcome surprise, especially as the room turned out to be the size of a one bedroom flat with an enormous free standing bath in the en-suite plus a large shower room and fluffy bathrobes. The room itself was on the second floor overlooking the pool on one side and a side street on the other, and contained a separate study and relaxing area plus a dining table with complimentary fruit and wine,"
"From entering to leaving this hotel, is a great experience. The hotel staff are friendly and professional.  Breakfast is a super experience with a wide variety of choices.  try to go before 8am to get a window seat overlooking the harbor.  To walk in the vicinity of the hotel is also a great experience with several art deco buildings. rooms are really well planned and spacious.  gym is a great experience and the pool area is rather private."
"Nothing is too much trouble for you in this hotel. It is grandeur deluxe. Every detail is exceptional. Lovely walking distance to lots of markets, restaurants and shops and our view from the room was the gate of India. I highly recommend this hotel if anyone is visiting g Indis. "
"This was the first time I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel - its a perfect blend of modern facilities and a historical landmark. The fact that the hotel takes care to preserve and display its history - speaks volumes of their respect and affection towards their roots.  The service is great, the facilities second to none, and the view - unparalleled. This is a hotel you must visit and stay in, because it takes you back into an era when the world was still more real and grounded. And it brings you back to the current reality, seamlessly.  I left the hotel feeling pure admiration. And knowing that I will come back for sure."
"What can I say. One of the best places to stay in India. First time I came here at the age of 21, and since then I come here regularly. I am 55 now. Hospitality of the staff if of best standards. This time specially we went to Gym and had a massage from Imtiyaz. Very professional. Made us feel relaxed gave me a body massage. Breakfast was amazing. I would highly recommend Taj hotel to experience the Tajness.  Thanks to all the staff for amazing trip to India."
"Every time you visit here, you feel the warmth, hospitality, heritage and many more things which will make you feel so good. A true gift to Mumbai located at an amazing place full of vibrancy. Keep visiting"
"A fantastic hote, that takes one back to a by gone era  when travel was in the realm of the few and they were treated accordingly.An iconic building,with fantastic amenities,wonderful staff, world class resturants  with rooms and suites in the Palace wing that are flawless."
"We stayed here as a family of 4 (two children aged 9 and 7) for one night (as a special occasion). We were hoping to get a room in the Palace although it was fully booked so stayed in the Towers - brilliant room nonetheless.   From the moment we entered to leaving, we were made to feel really special by the exceptional staff who make this hotel the iconic and highly regarded world-class hotel that it is.  In particular I have to expressly thank Ms Mahtaab Sidwha who warmly greeted us upon arrival, arranged drinks, escorted us to our room, arranged our restaurant table, and met us upon departure.   Mahtaab made our stay special by truly understanding our needs. We arrived late due to a five hour delay with our flight. We were really disappointed to be arriving at the Taj in the"
this is one of popular hotel in mumbai . i stayed  last year September 2017. we got the nice room with a sea view. reception staff are very polite room service staff are also good and active.  nice view with swimming pool . ovar all its was good experience 
Since retirement we have been steadily moving up the travel food chain – business class flying – first time I turned left I wondered if I would challenged as an imposter or arrested by the fashion police – and so it has become with hotels – first real 5 star city hotel experience was the Oberoi in Kolkata where we were made very welcome from the start – able to quickly relax into the role of an aging 5* traveller – and so it is here – lots of attention lots of smiles and greetings – thank you  Late evening arrival on a Sunday evening from airport after a long day of travelling from Jorhat via Kolkata – followed by hunt the pre-booked ride at the airport – traffic at 11.00 pm was just manic at times as it could have been rush hour  However all the pressures of the day faded after
"It is a really nice mid range resturant in THE TAJ MAHAL PALACE, the place has got a really efficient and kind staff. With a overwhelming food. Its a muat visit for special occasions! The only con I peraonally found here was the need of a driver with you... Since there was no place to park the car and had to be kept far away."
"Miserable, difficult to please old devil that I am, even I cannot find fault with this place.  The staff are without exception well mannered and friendly (and goodness only knows how many of them there are!) food is wonderful, location couldn’t really be better and the quality of everything is exactly what you would expect at this level.  The building is a true icon and unlike much of India, is properly maintained. Some of the art on the walls is excellent and there is lovely furniture scattered around the place. The pool area is wonderful too with only the incessant horn blowing noise of perpetually impatient drivers on the roads outside.  It’s a marvellous place and if you can afford it, don’t think twice.  A real oasis and retreat from the fantastical madness that is Mumbai."
"I began my two week holiday in India by staying at the Taj Mahal Palace for three nights. As I was in ‘relax’ mode, I didn’t leave the property much which was perfect. I had booked a sea view club floor room but when I checked in at 330 am they informed me that I was upgraded to a suite with no sea view. This was fine with me. The building is beautiful - more from inside than outside. The staff are attentive and helpful. The room was kind of dated and smelled musty but was still relaxing and comfortable. Club Lounge offerings were good and staff were excellent and offered personal service. I tried the Indian restaurant for lunch and found it just okay. Interesting food but I think toned down for western palates. Service was all over the place.  All in all I would recommend the"
Classic hotel in a great position with excellent facilities and good service . Stayed in a club room with butler service and access to the club facilities Good food and friendly service. In a very busy city this hotel is in a great position and deserves its status
"We were in Mumbai on a cruise for a few days and when we went to Elephant island we finish our special day with a real treat: 2 teas + Snack. I couldn't tell you what I had, the gentlemen who serve us suggested. However my bill says 1 Dahi Bta Puri, 1 sancha, 1 Taj house bl-Tea. We both loved our teas that offered some cookies included in the price and the snack was delicious.....we shared it but I could have it all by myself without any problem! We were sitting by the window and the view is one of a kind. When in Mumbai if you go to the Taj Mahal Palace you can also go shopping next door......that is what we did and I have a wonderful bracelet as a souvenir to remind me of that trip."
"We had a very enjoyable stay and were sorry to leave. It is very easy to become accustomed to wonderful service, fabulous food and views, the calm of the poolside an oasis in a hectic Mumbai and even the beautifully equipped gym. Every member of staff who we came into contact with always tried to exceed expectations. The premier of Canada and ourselves who were staying at the same time can't be wrong! Trouble is that it spoilt us for other hotels."
The best hotel we have stayed in anywhere in the world accommodation first rate breakfast and afternoon tea to be recommended the souk restaurant on top of the Taj Tower is a must the only downside the Chinese restaurant but as a whole it's a must visit hotel 
"I was amazed by their great hospitality, the welcome was super beautifully dressed, staff, # Thulsy mala wow what great idea. Room was very comfortable, well-trained staff who always there to help you at any time. each and every corner of the hotel is a story. the resort orientation is very helpful and well planned. I will surely return."
"Memories of yester years seeing the Taj Mahal Palace by Gateway, the ghastly acts of 26/11, human tragedy, the destruction, the charred appearance of the façade and now the splendour relived. How can one describe or review the experience of this iconic building and the wonderful humans who go to make this place so special?  From reception, check in to check out, room service, breakfast service, attention to fine detail such as being addressed by one's name by people you have met only once before, the internal architecture, the comfort in the room, everything was a pleasure and has left everlasting memories. I am sure there are many such luxury hotels but the way the staff greet you and engage with you is exemplary.  Stay here just for the 'tajness', if not for the internal"
"This place is amazing, truly out of this world!  I had stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace a couple of years ago on a business trip, and promised my wife that I would take her to India for a holiday and include a couple of nights at the Taj Mahal Palace as a treat.  It did not disappoint.  Stay in the original building (not the tower) and get a room/suite with a sea view.  It will cost more, but the extra is worth it, this is a special experience.  The hotel is wonderful, colonial in style, moden rooms and facilities, and amazing service.  In the hotel world, this is one of the 7 Wonders of the World!"
We arrived at this hotel after long flights via Dubai and exhausting experience navigating through Visa procedure at the airport. This was our first hotel of many on our trip around southern India with friends. We found this hotel to be outstanding although not our favourite during our visit to India! We found a very warm welcome quick check in and on to our rooms. These were stunning in the Palace wing with seaview overlooking the India gate.Very well equipped rooms and extremely well serviced. We chose to eat in the eastern Mediterranean restaurant at the top of the tower for our first dinner and it was stunning. Second night we ate at the Indian restaurant food was amazing and service excellent too. We joined the tour of the hotel on one of our evenings and found it very
"We celebrated our marriage anniversery  there.The staff was very cooperative . They arranged for nice welcome by way rose petals and red ballons all over room.The small cake was very tasty,and even the bouquet was very attractive.We enjoyed the stay sans their nice other upgradation facilities."
"Arrived at the Taj the evening of New Year’s Eve, unfortunately unbeknown to us the city centre is totally blockaded off by the police! So after walking to the hotel with all off our luggage we were refused entry at the main gates of the hotel even though we were booked to stay for 2 nights. We were sent through the crowds to the back entrance of the hotel were we waited along time to get in.(not the best start to our stay in this iconic hotel!). Once inside there is no doubt that this hotel is as opulent as can be. The smell of beautiful incense, luxurious furnishings, immaculately presented staff, it really is top notch. We were greeted by a very professional staff member who showed us to our room, apologised for the arrive we had experienced & compensated us by giving us full"
"I’ve lost count of the number of times we’ve stayed at the Taj Palace.  We have stayed a various hotels in Bombay, but none compare to the Taj Palace.  This was however, our first time staying in the tower wing.  Done up in a more modern contemporary style than the heritage, it lacked somewhat in the old world charm of the heritage wing.  Although we had a suite, the space itself was rather small and it felt like the hotel had tried to squeeze too much (two bathrooms) in too little space.  House keeping was thorough and attentive.  Every night, during the turndown service, they would leave a foot spa with scented salts.  That was an absolutely welcome luxury – the best feeling, at the end of a long day, was to soak our feet in hot water and the salts.  Food and breakfast spreads"
"Third time I have visited the Taj Palace.  Wasn't disappointed the last time and certainly wasn't this time.  It is a busy hotel but manages still to make every guest feel important and special.  Lots of little extras that make me want to choose Taj hotels when I travel.  This time our housekeeper put a complimentary food scrub, bowl and petals in our room, it was wonderful.  It is worth every penny."
It was my birthday and I selected to visit this place with my family. When we reached the tables facing the windows overlooking the sea were full. So they arranged for a table overlooking the sea in the non ad area. After a while though we shifted to the ad area .  The food was comprising of a variety of Indian and western menu. There were fried snacks and chaats. There were bread items. Sweets were the highest. Pastries tarts chocolates and all you can name from the Taj patisserie itself of cos. Tea and coffee of all varieties were served to your table at once and that too unlimited. Food also is served when you call for an item. Service is exquisite. We ate to our content. It was on that day that I came to know of the Taj membership of inner circle. The next thing I did was in
"We stayed for 5 days during Feb half term and from the moment we were greeted by the hotel car at the airport, I knew we were in for a special stay. Tight security at entrance where your car will be checked and your bags have to go through scanner, but this is to be expected considering the history. Once inside the check in was faultless and your hostess escorts you to your room. The tower has been refurbished since my husband stayed 2 years ago and the room was bright and clean and well equipped with all the latest tech and gadgets. We were on the 12th floor and had an amazing view of the Gateway to India. The staff on this floor were exceptional and the added extra's of sweets, birthday balloons and foot spa service were a lovely special touch. The pool and pool restaurant are"
The oldest Hotels of india  This hotel was build by Foreigners One of the bst hotel in the world... All Foreigners come to mumbai n stay in this hotel..n India's big celebrities visit here for party n all....Best hotel love this hotel
"A truly iconic hotel. I feel very privileged to have experienced a stay at this amazing hotel. Everything is just sublime from the professionalism of the staff to the art work around the building to the history of the palace to the pool area. The staff are amazingly attentive and there are so many beautiful additional touches that surprise you during the stay. It’s amazing. I couldn’t recommend it more highly.  The early morning yoga class by the pool is a must to to start your day feeling refreshed and revitalised, Prabhat was professional and took care of everyone so well. Urmi in the sea lounge couldn’t have been more caring and helpful with her beautiful smile. Nilesh our driver made us feel safe and secure and had lots of knowledge of the city.  It was wonderful, truly"
We went for coffee and were presented with a huge menu of loads of different types from all over the world. We had Ethiopian coffee in the end and it was delicious! Came with yummy biscuits too. There was live piano and singing and a very posh atmosphere (with a bill to match!)
"Taj Mahal Palace is the first luxury hotel in India and without comparison the best hotel in Mumbai. It combines the historical atmosphere with brand new up to date facilities, great food and service. The Hotel is located at the harbour offering you a breath of fresh air in combination with a great view of the harbour and the Arabian Sea. The rooms are spacey and up to date with all moderne facilities and the the hotel offers an array of dining possibilities. The staff to guest ratio is almost two to one making certain that there is always someone available even though they sometimes stumble over each other. We will soon be back, this is the place to stay in Mumbai."
I have stayed there on a previous visit but this time only visited the hotel for afternoon tea. Exceptional place. Love it. Best hotel I have every been to. I would recommend visiting this hotel for a stay or just a bite to eat if your are in Mumbai. 
"This was a splurge for our last night of a one month long trip to India.  Worth every penny.  Every detail was perfect, staff was great, food was great, rooms comfortable.  Absolutely loved everything about the experience. "
"It is situated in a perfect location, overlooking the Arabian Sea and Gateway of India!  There’s designer boutiques such as Louis Vuitton inside the hotel and other shopping stores too.  You can also have afternoon tea and various restaurants are available inside to eat at.  Make sure to include breakfast with your stay. The buffet breakfast has a large variety of items to eat from including healthy options too. Very tasty and filling!   There’s was a confusion with our rooms, therefore complimentary drinks and tea were provided and we were upgraded to the largest suite!   Worth the stay and everything was top notch! Beyond expectations!"
"Such a pity! Perhaps hotels like the Taj are such famous tourist attractions, they become jaded and complacent, taking their customers for granted. In Mumbai for a conference, I was booked at the Taj by my hosts, in the new Tower (the Palace is the heritage wing). I had a reservation for a non-smoking, ocean view room and since I added one night, I was at first given a city view one. When they moved me the day after, it was on a very stinky smoking floor (bought air freshener, there were no other rooms). Then loud construction work started just above me (made six phone calls, complained for one hour, got them to stop).  When I checked out, a flight awaiting, I was held at rude-gaze point for 20 mins because, the attendant insisted, the bill was not paid. They finally reached my"
What a treat staying at such an icon. Had an outstanding dinner in their Indian restaurant. Breakfast was absolutely superb with everything on offer. Really liked the location. The outside pool area was idyllic for lunch. Treat yourself.
"We stayed in the tower which is still luxury, just not ""crazy luxury"" as the older building. The rooms were classy and the view of the gateway to India was perfect. Watching trip boats, fishing boats and  navy ships was fascinating."
"Incredible! From the moment we stepped into the taj from the moment we left we felt unbelievable, staff went out of there way every second we were there to help us, it was a perfect end to our India trip. Thank you for making it so wonderful for us."
"It is the best luxury hotel in India with King size Beds and the best Interior of rooms in Colonial style like palace. Worth staying with wife. Best location. You get sea view, city view and Pool view."
"Dear Mr. Taljinder, we have been trying to contact you for past several days.  Your staff Mr. Sasawat, Mr. Siddharth and one of your waiting staff at Soulk were extremely rude to me & my family.  This is not the Taj we know of.  Extremely rude and disrespectful.   Just because you take a pre-authorization at time of check-in, it doesn't give you the right to treat guests in a rude manner.  I am sure you would have CCTV footage of the Soulk and then from outside our room, where your staff argued with us for 2 hours.  They truly spoilt our entire stay.  I would never ever recommend Taj to anyone else.    We eventually left your hotel in midnight, disgusted and in shock by the manner in which your staff treated us.  Post our stay, we have tried to reach out to multiple people in"
"I visited this hotel about 3 years ago and had an amazing stay!  This time everything seemed very different, possibly due to new management as discussing with other guests that have used the hotel for years, they felt exactly the same and said all the hotel is now solely focused on charging EXTORTIONATE PRICES!  The booking process was very confused and the price was approximately 30% more than the online confirmation, due to taxes and other fees. I queried this on arrival and was told it would be looked into in case a mistake had been made. I also asked if breakfast was included and was told again they would look into it and let me know - I HEARD NOTHING BACK until checkout when they had no record of my queries and concerns.  I had an embarrassing problem in the restaurant also"
"The Taj is an impressive and traditional hotel. I didn´t stay there, just visited it. The public areas are beautiful and reflect the colonial times. Th furniture is terrific and the ornaments belong to old times. Beautiful."
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for three nights in Feb 2018 and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The location is fantastic, overlooking the Gateway of India (I had a wonderful view of it from my room) and it has easy access to Elephanta Island and other local attractions. The staff members have all been extremely helpful and always looks for opportunities to make the stay more comfortable for you. Breakfast offers a wide range of Indian and international options, including some food items that can be ordered (not on the buffet). The facilities and cleanliness are exceptional. A fantastic visit and I would stay again. Service was exceptional."
"Faultless in terms of style, decor and provision of service, but strip away the grandeur and the rooms in the tower are functional rather than amazing, and the service suffers from its vast size! Variety of food is excellent but choice in terms of cost not so much. We liked the 'residents-only' spaces and the views of the Gate."
"Oh my word what can I say about this place. Perfect in every way, it’s absolutely stunning and breath taking. Rooms are amazing as is the corridor, grand staircase & dining rooms. The staff bend over backwards to make sure your stay is perfect. I will definitely stay here again."
"Visited with friends for afternoon tea, which was an amazing experience, and we were made very welcome. The hotel has charm, style, refined quality and so much history. Take the time to really appreciate what is there to see, and enjoy the memories."
"Lovely Hotel with great location. The staff are the major asset of this hotel and cannot be praised enough. The rooms have improved greatly since our last stay in the Tower rooms. Special mention to the housekeeping staff and the the little trinkets left in the room. What does need improvement is the WIFI. This is a problem in ALL Taj hotels it is slow and useless, unless one PAYS for a faster speed. Very old fashioned in this day and age. I know that this is premium hotel but the prices charged for drinks is ridiculous, 1200 rupees for 2 Kingfisher!!!!"
We just visited here to have a look around and a have drink. It is a beautiful hotel on the waterfront with very friendly staff and well worth a visit . The pool area is for residents only but it looked great. There is a magnificent staircase . Beers weren't too expensive considering the grandness of the hotel
"If you have a chance to stay here... then stay here. I am not the richest person, so this was a 5 star hotel I could actually afford to stay at. Let me tell you, you're not going to get a better experience. It's beautiful, the food/ breakfast was INCREDIBLE! The rooms are gorgeous, beds insanely comfortable. It has everything, and I really appreciated the friendly staff!! Even the shampoo and conditioner were unreal! I wish I could buy it!"
"Well i stayed in this very hotel last week while visiting mumbai for my business conference with viacom 18 network. The place as they say is probably gonna provide you with the best experience that you can ask for in Mumbai.  The view, the luxurious stay, the deep indian tradition. Its all worth the money that you put in to stay in hotels like these.  It definitely has my recommendation."
"Highly trained professionals, courteous housekeepers, charming ladies at the reception, mouthwatering delicacies and so on.... The best part was the upgradation from luxury grand sea view room to Seagull suite, I think the ultimate royal treatment anyone can ask for. A dream fulfilled! "
"We stayed in the Tower Wing - clean, crisp, modern and airy rooms, where you pay less than staying in the older wing of the original building, but with the same stunning view of the Arabian Sea and Gateway of India, and the same glamorous communal facilities. Room was great, amazing view, super comfortable bed, plenty of room in the bedroom, good storage. Housekeeping would leave lovely treats each day - desserts, face packs, rose petals etc. The only gripes would be:  (a) A bit gross but the drawer of my bedside table smelt really, really bad. not sure  what someone had done in it. (b) Bathroom has a large and really good shower but is otherwise really small with very little space for your toiletries .  Those small gripes aside, it is a real experience and privilege to stay"
"Magically Magnificent and Royal is also an understatement to this ""must go at-least once in a life time "" to this hotel.and live.It is a monument and a heritage hotel where all the whos and whos of the world have come and stayed.It has a history of its own.There is a very beautiful Pool.we had stayed in the New towers of the Property for our Anniversary. They gave us a cake at the dinner table in the Chinese Restra and decorated our room with balloons. Considering that the hotel is so famous and comes in the luxury category with such high price point-I had expected more.cheap balloons was the basic min that they did.I was at least expecting a bottle of wine/Campaign in my room when they said that there will be a surprise awaiting.Also I am a member of the Taj Inner circle so yes"
What a treat. Normally we do not like large hotels but the outstanding friendly and polite service makes you feel you are a valued guest. Our “city view’ room in the Palace Block in fact looked out over the garden and pool but we were more than happy and comfortable.  Lots of little touches- suncream provided for instance.  Lovely pool only for residents and exceptionally helpful towel and sun lounger assistant.  Have breakfast in Sea Lounge and if you are lucky you might get a table by the window. What a way to begin a day in this stimulating city.  We loved our two nights. 
"I was in awe from the moment we walked into the hotel.  Its majestic appearance and continued feeling throughout the hotel made our stay an unforgettable one.  The service was impeccable at all levels throughout the stay.  I have stayed in many nice hotels, but this tops the list by far.  What a fantastic experience.  Thank you to all your staff.  We stayed in the palace wing, where the hotel management had kindly upgraded us - the corridors that lead to each floor are just magnificent."
"We stayed at The Taj Mahal Palace for four nights, and (in terms of the hotel itself) it was a wonderful experience. The room was very comfortable and spacious. At around 30 metres long, the swimming pool is spectacular and ideal for people like me who swim to exercise. The staff were universally helpful and friendly.   We made the mistake of eating dinner in “The Souk” on our first night. The bill was eye-wateringly expensive and the view (from the top of the hotel’s tower wing) was nothing special. [I would normally pay a third of that amount for a similar Middle Eastern meal in the middle of London.]  A bit of further research revealed that all the hotel’s other restaurants were equally over-priced for dinner. (To be fair, the poolside bar did provide a very good lunch at a"
A outstanding experience from Airport pic up to drop off at the Airport Nice room with seaview towards Gate of India exactly as I booked A friendly atmosphere in the lounge where I could enjoy free drinks and canapees the breakfast had everythng I think of  the ride to the Airport incl a guidning only negative I find was a bad WiFi
"The title says it all. We had a wonderful two night stay in the Taj - Palace wing and loved it.   It made for a great finale to our Indian trip, a haven of calm amid the craziness of Mumbai.  The hotel is beautifully maintained and the staff and service gracious and welcoming. We enjoyed the breakfast in the Sea Lounge and managed to get window seats on both days, and as well as our final Indian meal in Masala Kraft.  The heritage tour of the hotel is a must and the archivist who led it was so charming and knowledgeable in bringing the history of the building alive. Thank you too, to the security staff who rescued my favourite black hat which was speedily brought up to my room.  Taj goes the extra mile to make every guest feel special and it's the little touches that achieve"
"Service is examplary and the breakfast buffet (in the old wing) was great.  We had dosas, special order.    Patrick, our server in the breakfast buffet was a delight to talk to.   Enjoyed the book store where I bought two books and enjoyed sitting in the lounge people-watching.    Lovely location and worth booking a seaside room."
"We wanted to see some of the suites and book for our wedding ceremony. We called them for an appointment and were asked to come in hotel and ask the same at the reception. At reception we were told to speak Reservation team, they directed us back to reception. Reception made us wait in the lobby and disappeared.   Didn't expect this from a hotel which so much prestige attached to it. We had thoughts of spending wedding night here but we ran once we got such hospitality. Sad state of affairs. May be if we had a white skin we would had got a better response."
I had visited this hotel in the month of June with my wife for honeymoon purpose. The internal and external locations of this hotel admired us. The location of this hotel was amazing and exciting as it is situated near the bank of Arabian Sea. The hotel location attracts many tourist. The service provided by Taj was grateful and fast.
"I appreciate the cost of staying at the Taj Mahal Palace in the original hotel is high for most people. If you have a chance to stay there for one night, I would say do it! I travel to India a lot and have stayed in 100's of hotels from 1 star to 5 star. I hadn't stayed at the Taj until my most recent trip to India and I thought, for the last night of a 3 week trip around the country, this would be the time. I booked a Sea view room in the Palace Wing. I noted from reviews on Tripadvisor that it wouldn't be the Taj experience if booking in the new extension wing. I'm glad I took note. The service is as you'd expect, perfect, the staff will do anything for you. The quality of the hotel was amazing and the restaurants and cafes are all great. We booked an afternoon tea here and"
"I've done a fair bit of travel in my time, but this sits at the top of my experiences.  I visited the Taj on a casual business trip, and it was fabulous from the moment we walked in.  Note: this was my first visit to India  When we arrived at the Taj (approx an hour drive... heavy traffic at all times), the car was stopped and inspected by security.  Pillars prevented any uninspected cars from entering the driveway.  Prior to walking into the hotel, there was a bag scanner and metal detector to walk through.  The security precautions are understandable given the events that happened in 2008.  Many places we went had such security measures in place, and it basically just made me feel safer.    STAFF: Upon arrival in the lobby of the Taj, each person in our travel party were"
The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is nothing short of superb. Every conceivable detail is taken care of from the moment you walk into the hotel entrance until the time you leave. The entrance security is so thorough you feel completely safe. It's a once in a lifetime experience and lives up to and exceeds anything you have every heard about it.
Beautiful classic hotel in the best spot in Mumbai. We stayed on the Towers and it had an amazing view of India Gate. The service is fanatic and rooms are perfect mix of modern and classic decorations. This was probably the best Taj hotel I stayed at in a large city (non resort). I would stay here again next time in Mumbai!
"Never likely to be able to stay as a guest but booked in for afternoon tea.  What an experience, treated as a five star visitor from arrival to departure. Staff were superb, surroundings beautiful with a serious hint of luxury.  Tea was lovely. Well worth a visit."
"This is A Hotel! This is a complete experience! The service, the friendliness, the beauty! It is clean and rooms are just wonderful! You fell like you've walked into a time capsule and gone back to colonial times... It is, by far one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in... I know where I will stay, next time in Mumbai!!"
"The classic royal heritage can be felt in the air. There is something that makes it just perfect. The passion, the belief that living our dreams is possible, accomplishment with humility all of this can be felt in an indescribable way. The honesty, self motivation and effort that has given birth to this magical grandeur can still be felt in the air. It is always a delight to spend time there. For me, it reminds me that if Mr. JRD Tata can, so can we!"
"Impeccable service, luxurious environment, bed extremely comfortable,  rooms extra clean. The food was delicious as well. The stay was worth every penny. Small oasis in hectic Mumbai. Fabulous visit: we will definitely be back !"
"We stayed at the Taj on our first stop on a month long trip to India. Flying in to Mumbai at 2:00 AM we were escorted to the hotel by our tour company. Didn't expect much arriving at the hotel around 3/3:30 AM but upon arrival we were treated as if it were regular business hours. The hotel has a check point outside where all luggage and guests are scanned to ensure safety, quick and efficient. Inside we were greeted with a warm welcome and an efficient check in process, we were even able to exchange some money upon arrival.   We had a view of the Gateway of India and the Sea in the tower side of the hotel. The rooms were impeccability clean stocked with everything we needed. The beds were comfortable and the AC was a welcomed amenity after a long 2 days travelling from Canada.  "
"This hotel is absolutely outstanding. This was our last hotel of many from our travels around India. Everything about this hotel is 5 Star PLUS. Very caring staff and perfect grounds this hotel is amazing. Full of history and all the small edges that go a long way. We will surely be back to this beautiful establishment. Shout out to the gentleman who served us in the bar and had worked for the hotel for over 40 years, Mistry you rock!!! "
"We have been lucky enough to do a fair amount of travel, and have stayed at lovely hotels and resorts in many places in the world.  The Taj Mahal Palace - Mumbai is probably the best city hotel we have ever been in -- it was magnificent.  We were in a harbor view room in the historic part of the hotel, and the view was fantastic. The service was perfect, the atmosphere was elegant and welcoming, the art work and design was rich with heritage and history. It was an amazing stay. "
"My father was from Bombay. We always stayed here for a few days when we were in town.  It is and always will be one of the most beautiful hotels I have been privelaged to visit regularly and to stay in.  I could write endlessly about every aspect of every trip but that would take too long!   The taj , as we call it, has always exceeded expectations and you must visit at least.  I reiterate, it is wonderful."
"After a decade of visiting in India, I decided to celebrate my partner's **th birthday by staying in the Taj Palace. We were not disappointed: from a speedy reception to our departure four days later, Taj did more than their best. It is very difficult to add anymore praise than that which has already been made for this establishment. The foundation of all of this praise is the complexed service culture for which Taj is renown. Service is the key to this hotel. You are never alone and expectations are exceeded at all points. If something is not correct, then a call brings swift action, though very few such calls were required."
"Upon entering the lobby after coming in from the airport, we were greeted late at night with welcome drinks.   Magnificent flower arrangements were the first thing I noticed along with crystal chandeliers.  Checking in was made very easy before being shown to our room.  Spacious was the room with all the appointments necessary in the bathroom.  Breakfast buffet was both Indian and English.  There were a number of restaurants with which to chose.  A lovely shopping arcade with an array of stores carried quality merchandise.  Hotel staff was easy to please.  Although Mumbai was not my favorite city, the hotel made my stay more pleasurable."
No one can ever go wrong on reviewing the Taj Mahal Palace hotel.   It is magnificent and grand.  It gives the perfect view of the Gateway of India. It has been my favorite choice for mini lunches/dinners with family.
"This hotel is amazing.  The architecture, location and it is an Icon.  The food and drinks were very expensive but having said that you kind of expect it in a hotel of this standard.  The staff were all very attentive.  Highly recommend."
"Just like its name says it, this is a PALACE indeed, a place where you will feel more important than you probably are. Fabulous breakfast - every dish that you might think of and even more, amazing room, fantastic bed, super friendly and responsive staff, this hotel has it all. Best place i ever stayed in my life by far. Room tip: go for a sea view room facing the Gateway of India. Great view!"
"We very much enjoyed our short stay in this iconic hotel with great views of the Gateway to India. We stayed in the Palace wing with beautiful bedrooms and bathrooms. All the public areas were beautifully kept and the flowers were very impressive. The pool area was a lovely place to spend a couple of hours. The Palace lounge for afternoon tea, evening cocktails and late evening cognac and chocolates was very welcome and open to us as we had booked a club room. Great choice at breakfast. All round really good."
"An amazing hotel which is an oasis in the middle of Mumbai. The hotel is beautiful, staff are charming and food fantastic. The pool area and terrace are a perfect place to decompress from the day’s activities. One night is not enough. "
"4 nights in a club room, well the service was first class. Drinks and nibbles in the sea view room were outstanding and the staff really spoil you with great service. Butler service was second to none, thank you to all of you that took care of us we were in room 627. The staff really make this place and you feel so at home. Beautiful hotel you have to visit when in Mumbai it’s the place to stay."
"An outstanding journey. I had a business trip for 5 days but I took my family with me. I am speechless for their warming hospitality. All the staff have a high standard of services. The view, the facilities, the in-ding, variety choices of restaurants everything was WoW! "
"It has been a few years since we stayed at the Taj and, sadly, we now realize we can no longer afford the Palace rooms.  We were only staying one night so decided to give the Tower a try.  We were pleasantly surprised by how nice the renovated rooms are.  We do realize that the décor is such that you could be staying anywhere in the world, but the rooms are larger than many hotels and are bright and airy, immaculately clean, and welcoming.    If you want to experience an Indian hotel at its finest, and you have the money, stay at the Palace, but otherwise the Tower is definitely a viable option.  The hotel is in a great location and, although the Mumbai location is extremely busy, we know that we can rely on the great Taj staff to take care of us if we run into problems."
A superb service as expected from the reputaion of this top cals hotels. Great location and if yo can get an upgrade to the Gateway of India view rooms you can see daily sunrises filterimg through the Gateway. Would return again anytime. Greta service Great breakfast and graet loaction.
"This is my fourth time to visit The Taj Hotel! And like every year, i will definitely go again. They have the beat hospitality, best staff, best service, and good food at shamiana restaurant (where they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner). I have never seen such a good service and pleasant employees that work with a smile and are not hesitant to help in any way. They even might go out of their way just to help out. Great outdoor pool which overlooks the garden and yoga classes are held besides it. They also have a small gym and a small spa area. Some of the rooms overlooks the Indian gate and it is less than 5mins walking distance. I had such a good time and will no doubt visit every year with family and friends. "
"Unfortunately we’ve spent only one night in this wonderful venue. Location is speachless. During the breakfast  you can enjoy the amazing view of the Indian Gate, everything was perfect, service-room-kindness . Is the place where you have to go visiting Mumbai. "
A visit to this hotel is always great and we loved the delicious chicken dansak cooked for us on Thursdsy evening 1st Feb in the all day restaurant - not only was the meat dish completely great - the rice was the best I have ever tasted - this was probably one of our favourite meals during our month long trip to India this time.  What a great chef and I am sorry I cannot remember his name.  Do try it you will not be disappointed!
"My wife, 2 kids & I checked into Taj Mahal Palace hotel at 5pm on Sat, Jan 20th.  We were celebrating 15th wedding anniversary.  We had a terribly bad experience at dinner at Soulk.  We brought this to attention of Mr. Saswat, the Duty Manager at the Hotel at that time.  My wife and I had a long argument from 11pm-1am with both Mr. Sasawat and the Food & Beverage manager.  We were disgusted by their behavior and my wife, I, 2 kids left the hotel at 1am.  This is not the way to behave with any family or customer.  We have stayed at Taj properties across India/US and this is not what we expect from Taj.  I would request you to sincerely probe the full incident, esp. behavior of Mr. Saswat, beverage manager, and the person who attended to us at Soulk.  Instead of having a great"
"We stayed for 2 nights in the Taj after spending 6 nights in Bandhavgarh and Kanha tiger reserves. It was wonderful to sink into the luxury and excellent service of the Taj with unfailingly friendly and helpful staff. We were upgraded unexpectedly to a suite in the older part of the hotel and it was stunning, attention to detail in everything was faultless. We ate in the Souk Lebanese restaurant one night and can thoroughly recommend the food there. Once again everything was perfect. This hotel is the ideal sanctuary from the exciting madness that is Mumbai!"
"A site to behold and sight to behold. It's a place you really must visit if you're visitng the Gateway of India in Mumbai. We dropped in after a trip to Elephant Island for a quick drink and bite to eat. We didn't eat in any of the more formal restaurants, just in their courtyard restaurant which is relaxed and informal. The food was excellent - chicken tikka (using thighs) was probably up there with the best I've every had - so succulent and sweet. Not expensive either considering it's the most famous hotel in Mumbai. The building is dramatic and beautiful offering Instagram fans snap happy opportunities at every turn."
"Walking through the palace in all it's majestic grandeur is an experience in itself. The walls truly do seem to seep with history and all the colours complement each other in the most elegant way. The room we stayed in was absolutely amazing, with the bed as it's crowning glory. The staff was incredible and was always ready to offer a short history lesson on the hotel and Mumbai. Couldn't be happier at the Taj, it was absolutely brilliant."
"The best of the best.  Huge, bustling hotel built in a bygone era but equipped with state of the art services. Wonderful rooms, heavenly bathrooms, sea views available and a lovely pool and patio area. If you can treat yourself to this one, go for it!"
"I have been lucky enough to stay in several of the worlds iconic colonial hotels. But overall this is the best one.  That said compared to the prices of other hotels in Bombay and India in general. This is by far the most expensive pro rata. But such a wonderful building. Beautifully maintained. With genuine & numerous ""pleased to see you"" staff. Politely offering to help all around this large, magnificent hotel."
"We couldn't come all the way to Mumbai without a visit to this lovely hotel. After dinner nearby, we popped in for a few cocktails at the bar. Not only were the cocktails really lovely and came with added theatre......the staff were also very warm and friendly. We really enjoyed it!"
"Best place to dine while you are staying at the Taj.   They have a seperate menu of the grill which is fantastic.  Try the cottage cheese steak,  thats my ultimate favourite.  The burgers are pretty good too.  The ambience , service and food surpass any level luxury in India!  thumbs_up"
"Stayed for a night last weekend at this property and I must say The Taj Palace, Colaba lives up to its name all the way. There was not one aspect that was disappointing, right from the time we checked in till we left the next afternoon. The hotel was buzzing with activity and the flower decorations at the main lobby as well as the poolside entrance were beautiful. We stayed in the Heritage wing with access to the Palace Lounge. Our room was lovely with the most pleasing decor and brilliant views of the arabian sea. We spent the afternoon at the poolside and later had some tea at the Sea Lounge. The staff were very warm and hospitable. Special thanks to Hussain Rizvi the duty manager who looked after us very well and Cyberica too. There are a number of restaurants with different"
"This review is a bit more close to home and heart because I was born in Mumbai and lived literally a stones throw away from the Iconic Taj Mahal hotel. Even though I visited it’s shops and restaurants as a child and our birthday cakes were always bought from “La patisserie ” this was the first time I had the opportunity to actually stay in the Taj whilst visiting my home town along with my partner who was very keen on “nowhere but the Taj”.           The Taj Mumbai does not really need reviews and has been and still is very much a legend in its own right and benchmark for hospitality, the elegance and old charm which has so solidly withstood all the modern competition and many others events in time. Hence I was only all too delighted to have experienced this part of history even"
Started on a high note as we were upgraded to palace room. It was quite large and tastefully designed with a lovely marble bathroom. The butler service made one feel special.Breakfast spread was good and overall prices were quite reasonable. Checkout process took longer than expected (about 45 mins) and can be streamlined. Location is excellent opposite  Gateway of India and near Colaba shopping district. Overall fantastic and memorable stay!
"Very nice 2 night stay here, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite (from a business room ) with everything we could possibly need and a harbour view. Also included were breakfast in the Sea Lounge which was excellent too, we had a window seat with an interesting view on both occasions. Plus evening drinks and canapés in the bar. There was also afternoon tea included but we didn’t have time for that unfortunately! We had a lunch by the pool and a dinner in the Indian restaurant, both were very good with charming attentive staff.  The Heritage tour in the early evening is very interesting and well worth doing.  Would certainly come back here if we were in Mumbai again."
"On our way, back to home from Goa, we decided to spend couple of days in Mumbai. And since hectic sightseeing was certainly not we were aiming at, we decided to enjoy our limited stay in Mumbai, and then the obvious choice was Taj Mahal Palace. Our original plan was to enjoy a journey of Tejas Express, which is one of the tourist attractions now. But, believe it or not, only because we wanted to spend the maximum time in Taj and that too without missing the dinner, we simply cancelled the plan of Tejas Express and took a flight from Goa to Mumbai, just to check-in few hours early there.   Now, our experience inside the hotel. As we came out of the car, and finally settled in our room after around 15 minutes, we were attended by at least 5-6 persons within this much time. One"
"We were in Mumbai on independence day and could not find an open bar anywhere so we tried our luck here. What a fantastic hotel, wish we could afford to stay here, anyway after some security checks they let us in to the harbour bar, well worth a visit and a look around. It was expensive 2400 R for four beers but worth it just for the experience."
We decided to have lunch in this magnificent hotel as we were nearby and I was keen to have a decent glass of wine after some time in Sri Lanka and India. I wasn't disappointed in the food or the wine. Prices were actually very reasonable and the service was great. The hotel itself is stunning and was a hive of activity during an international prime ministers visit. This didn't affect our dining experience at all once we cleared security and sat down to order.
visited for my birthday. stayed there for 2 nights. service was okay. Could have been better. Mostly the ambience is very good ofcourse. Room were nice. Good washrooms. But the food was not upto the mark.
"This place hardly needs a review. It is amazing. AMAZING! Stay here in the best room that you can afford and you will be rewarded. It's our 2nd time here, and we treated ourselves to Club rooms in the main hotel - brilliant breakfast, high tea, cocktail incl food - plus the pool - I have no word other than AMAZING!!"
"This was my first visit to Bombay (and India) and I really wanted to stay somewhere which had character, charm, luxury and history. My girlfriend is originally from the surrounding area, so I also wanted to surprise her with a stay in an iconic  building which means so much to the city.   Needless to say, we weren't disappointed. The staff are amazing and smiling throughout. Adorable people... especially the fantastic cleaning staff. The breakfast was superb and served with fine hospitality... there was a great selection. The pool area is clean, well appointed and well serviced. I enjoyed my coffee and beers in the poolside bar area...  The location is awesome. If you can, make sure you get a room with a view of the Gateway of India... it really is picture-postcard. The"
Well worth a visit if only for a drink in the harbour lounge. Admire the lovely marble floors and waterfall feature. Designers shops are in abundance and attentive staff.  Good security before you can enter. 
"i have been to many hotels in the world This was just perfection, we had a suite  and refined surprises every night with flowers compositions and perks The gym is almost like a small Equinox with a trainer present all the time  I had a reflexology massage at the Spa before a 16 hour flight which was divine the concierge Clayton took all the tome necessary to recommend restaurants and shoppings and the butler Adrian was taking care of everything there are 4 restaurants ,we tried 2 and they were great cannot wait to get back"
"Iconic hotel with great history.  Choice of Tower (new section) and Palace (original section).  On arrival shown to our room in Tower.  Very nice room but now what we wanted.  Seemed to be a mix up in the reservation.  Rather seamlessly we were moved to the Palace.  Better view of India gate and water front from Tower but we cherish the old.  Also Palace side comes with a butler as Tower does not.   Our butler, Mr. Narendra Khaire was everything you could hope for (rivals butlers at Burj Al Arab).  Always with a smile, Narendra would notice things that could use his attention and he would suggest how he could help.  Thank you Mr. Narendra.  Namaste"
"The place is beloved by our whole family.  Recently when my extended family arrived from the states,  we went to Shalimar. Our experience was very poor. Firstly Mr Arun at the security check was absolutely rude specially to our grandmother who needs help walking too. Then came the poor service at Shalimar. In spite of the manager coming at the end apologizing for the poor service and accepting that the waiter was new,  it's not something you expect at Taj.  Sad to know that a heritage is gonna loose its glory soon.  "
"I have stayed in great hotels around the world but this hotel is truly special. Service, food, rooms, cleanliness, staff... everything is of the highest quality! You walk around or sit by the fabulous pool area, you know you are somewhere special... breakfast in the Sea Restaurant looking at the Gateway of India with the sun rising is not going to be forgotten in a hurry..."
"If you are an Indian and intend to stay here be prepared to be embarrassed. Some of the people in the staff are racist and probably want to cater only to foreigners. Even you are an Indian staying here and shelling out the same amount of money, they will ask you what your business is while entering the hotel while foreigners can walk right by. Never imagined facing racism in my own country and that too by my own countrymen.   The duty manager duly offered apologies but maybe the message needs to travel to the the security as well.   Make no mistake, most of the staff here are extremely pleasant and helpful but then you may run into those who will ruin your whole experience and give you the worst memories that will last a lifetime (Not sure how I can forget this experience and"
"Only stayed for one night, on our way to Pench National Park, but wish we had longer. An absolutely beautiful hotel, with a great story.  Staff are second to none. Rooms are well appointed - but not all the views are good. Breakfast has everything!!  Would love to return one day "
Mr arun who is the secirity incharge during the entry at the resort is amazingly and surprisingly rude. We had our grandmother who can barely walk and she took her phone in her hand hrough the security channel and this Mr Arun said or rather yelled I told you 3 time leave the phone in the basket and made a old women pass by the security channel again just to satisfy his ego. What a brat. A lover for taj is truly dissapointed due to this behaviour and sworn to never return to taj until they apolized to my grandmother. Terrible & unexpected behaviour. 
Security is very strict when you enter this amazing hotel. Once you are in there are many choices of venues. The lobby is so elegant and full of beautiful flowers. There are many high end shops right of the lobby. We had a lovely lunch with local food in the main floor restaurant. I would also recommend the top floor restaurant because of the view. Service impeccable and food prices OK.
".  I’ve reviewed The Taj before and sadly I see very little improvement. The security procedures from the overzealous security is a bore and has ruined the aesthetic of the hotel. The replacement Taj Club uninspiring and dull with petty regulations.  And compared to other hotels I’ve travelled to in India there’s far too much “no, you cannot do that” - “not, that’s not possible” from the staff at this hotel. The word “No” should never be used, there’s better ways to convey what you need to say even if it is a negative.  But what really turned my stomach, from a hotel that uses the tag line “Strive for Excellence”, is the filthy stained uniforms worn by the staff at The Sea Lounge at breakfast. You would not accept it in a fast food joint, and it’s shocking to witness in a 5 star"
This is a wonderful place to stay and it is worth signing up for the tour of the hotel for Residents. This gets booked up quickly so book as soon as you arrive. We stayed in the historic part of the hotel rather than the tower which has no character. Good range of dining facilities. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Close to the historic part of the city. Not such a good location if you are in town for business as it is about an hour from the main financial district of Bandra.
It is the first luxurious hotel in india offering a great service. I visited here a week ago and the staff is excellent. Cleanliness is up to the mark. A great view from the hotel and the best part is location of the hotel.
"We didn't consider staying anywhere else for our short Mumbai break, booking five nights in the Palace Wing here and looking forward to returning to an hotel we'd enjoyed on previous visits.  From the minute we stepped inside, we remembered how lovely the hotel is, what an oasis of calm in a busy busy world.  But we were unfortunate to arrive during the stay of Mr Netanyahu and his entourage and I didn't appreciate being greeted by two armed guards pointing machine guns directly at me.  Whilst Mr N was in residence, the security was intrusive and made the hotel feel ""different"".  When he left, it came as a relief and we felt we could breathe again.  I understand heads of state and other celebrities visit the hotel often and can only say how thankful I am to have not encountered"
"Iconic hotel, very beautiful and excellent service. The meet and greet at the airport was terrific, and the bell boy met us at the luggage belt and directed us to our driver. Couldn't have been smoother. The check in went quickly and smoothly, and our rooms were lovely. We opted for the main hotel, not the tower. The turn down service was the best i've ever experienced, with a screen cleaner left on my charging iPad, and a bookmark left on my bedside book. The bathrooms are large with big marble baths. High tea is a full meal in itself, with so much hot and cold choice, again, up with the best in the world. It was very busy, but it was Christmas eve, but this worked in our favour, as they opened up the restaurant at the top of the tower for breakfast, so great views.. Our"
"my husband and i were fortunate to stay at the Taj for two nights. it was a one in a lifetime experience, and i'm sure we will come back. it starts at the beautiful old style grandeur building , continue with the perfect ambiance, flower arrangements,   courteous staff, exceptional service, dreamy breakfast, the most comfortable  large bad . we were celebrating our 13 Anniversary, and by the time we were at the check in counter we have been told that we were  upgraded to the most beautiful Dutch suite. needles to say that it was divine, with the perfect view to watch the sunrise at the bay and India Gate. specious, beautifully furnished, equipped with every little thing you could imagine . the staff was exceptional service oriented. it feels like there aren't enough expressions"
"Its amazing hotel in Mumbai, if you are in mumbai, you must try to feel a great hospitality. staff is really nice. you can also enjoy a great view of arabian sea from this hotel also you can see the gate of india too."
"The place is amazing the structures well made to perfection that why its a world attraction.great view , we had a tour guide all went well.its one of the best in the world.downside on site visiting a lot of cameraman asking to take just a picture which will end up more which they will force you to take you just have to ignore as they will not stop till you say yes just stand your ground and say no"
Wow. Old style grandeur and spirit combined to make what must be one of the best hotels in the world. If you think it looks amazing from the outside wait until you stay here. You then realise that it is the dedication of the staff that creates an unforgettable experience and that that is ultimately the asset that makes the difference. The attention to detail and to what will make your stay more enjoyable is amazing. This spirit can really only stem from a management culture which is uncompromising in delivering an outstanding experience which surely must be the envy of other hotels out there. Just some of the details... We asked the hotel to organise pickup from the airport and were met by chauffeur and upon arrival at the hotel greeted by name which was a nice touch. Then
"This place is very iconic and has had many celebrities, political figures, musicians grace this Hotel the evidence is in hallways which have photos displayed on the main floor as well on the second floor. We just went for drinks and found out that they actually have a afternoon tea service in the  Sea Lounge however I do recommend reservations. They offer the traditional finger food delights to accompany any British style tea service from cucumber sandwiches to crumpets and clotted cream. There are other alternate choices to enjoy a drink in this luxurious hotel. If you have some deep pockets and wish to shop Louis Vuitton, Mont Blanc, Panerai and Rolex are some the stores you can throw your dollars around!! there are a few other boutique stores offering exclusive indian"
"Nothing much to add. I truly 5 star hotel that deserve 5 star review. Location, maintenance, service, f&b and all of this at the south tip of Mumbai. The whole experience from arriving to leaving is a 5 star experience. It’s expensive but every penny worthy. Stay at the palace part of the hotel and you well enjoy the full experience. Thanks to the staff making the stay a great experience.  Wow!"
"Position of this place is so that there is no interference of main city ,you can love this site and hotel, having all the facilities what a man want for his best stay peaceful and enjoyment   ,GOOD ROOM, SERVICE,GOOD FOOD,PEACE FULL ENVIRONMENT, GOOD LOCATION, ETC"
"We visited the Taj Palace for a snack lunch during a recent trip to Mumbai. The hotel is extremely impressive and is a joy to visit. The first floor dining area has lovely views over the sea and the Gateway to India. However, the food quality was extremely poor. While we expected the price of even a snack such as a chicken/cheese toastie to be relatively high we would have expected a high level of quality to match not the very poor toasted sandwich with a small handful of crisps that we received. We appreciate that you pay for the surroundings but we expect the quality of the food to reflect this quality."
"I have been staying in the Taj Mahal Place Hotel since 1968 and have shared its transformations. I love many things about it; I should say cherish many things about it! The Central Stair Tower is an incredible experience and I love the Sea Lounge. Rooms facing the sea in the old wing are great and romantic ! The pool experience is the best in India and one of the best in the world, though the changing rooms leave room for improvements. You can get superb Chinese and Japanese cuisine in the Taj Mahal. For me, its a must stay for a person who is exploring India. "
We had an amazing stay over the New Year period. Our suite in the Palace wing was enormous and beautifully furnished and maintained with attention to detail. Service throughout the hotel was spot on but in particular Rakesh was a complete star and helped us with restaurant bookings and everything else that cropped up. Only niggle was the number of outside people wandering around in the lobby at all times.
Booked a palace room with a sea view. It was amazing. Service was excellent. Little thoughts and touches really stand out as a company that really wants to go the extra distance. Could not find fault. Would have liked a little more help from the Concierge / Travel Desk when it came to our onward travel. Overall an amazing experience and one not to be forgotten. Thank you.
"If you cannot afford to stay here and want to have the luxury of being at the taj high tea is a must. Apart from the sandwiches and scones there is an Indian hot buffet ( all unlimited). Desserts are varied too. If you get a window table that will be a bonus. Booking essential, we did from London."
"We choose The Taj Mahal Palace as a two night treat after tour of India and Sri Lanka. And wasn’t disappointed.  Such an amazing hotel with excellent service and attention to detail.  In such a busy city you feel completely at home, special and relaxed.  We didn’t want to leave.  Thank you.   "
Always wanted to stay here and did not disappoint. Initially allocated a room in the tower clean and modern but no character and awful glass screen bathroom where you can watch your other half on the toilet - who started this awful trend?? Anyway after a discussion with the management we were moved to the palace wing which is another world and a fabulous experience. Beautifully decorated rooms and facilities. Super pool area  and wonderful staff - really lovely. My only niggle is the number of tourists who wander around as it is a tourist attraction in its own right obviously - but this is annoying when you are sat around the pool etc.  Great hotel can’t wait to go back
"Awesome. A master piece. Words not enough to describe its grandeur. Class in its own. Terrific food, shopping, rooms and bath rooms, services, views, swimming pool, bar and the lobby. A perfect place to host business conferences."
"We travel in India many time and always choose the finest hotel when we can...the Taj Mahal is the best you can get in Mumbai, the location is great, the view is amazing, and the hotel is a visit in the history of this city, you can take a guided tour and learn about the history of this palace and realize how lucky you are to be there... wonderfull experience.."
"This hotel from the moment you step out of your taxi onto the premises you are greeted with the most amazing staff who welcome you and make you feel comfortable, the check in process the the rooms and the cleaners are second to none, there is absolutely nothing you could fault them on, we found a restaurant up on the roof top balcony that was called Souk, we highly recommend it, the waiters are very informative and the food was a culinary delight, we even had the chef come out and surprise us with a rose petal ice cream that I am going to have to search back home in Australia to get. Cecily and Dino Australia."
beautiful hotel and great service.  pool is nice.  great respite from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai.  The only negative was the breakfast.  We went to the main restaurant for breakfast but were told there would be a 10 minute wait and it would be better if we went to the restaurant in the tower extension part of the hotel.  We ended up going there as we thought the view would be good - which is was.  However we ended up waiting 15 minutes to be seated.  The quality of the food didn't seem to reflect a 5 star hotel - a lot of it felt like it had been sitting around for a while.  On a positive they did make freshly cooked eggs for us.  I don't know if the quality was any better downstairs as we only stayed for 1 night.  There did seem a much bigger range at least.
"We keep coming back to the Taj and always love it. Great room, wonderful views on the gate of India, fantastic breakfast, great swimming pool. And of course the staff, so professional and friendly. We will of course come back."
Must visit Shamyana. We had Paneer and Pizza and it was delicious. I love the Pizza of Taj. We even had Truffle and it was lovely. Service is really quick and admirable. We had a friendly visit and we all had so much of fun. It was a memorable visit. It is the best place to click pics.
"I have stayed at a lot of hotels in Asia, but everything about Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai is exceptional. They welcome guests with a traditional warm Indian welcome ( don't worry, no dancing). The hotel itself is an architectural delight and combines the best of old, colonial Mumbai and fresh, new, innovative interiors.  The towering staircase is jaw dropping, as is the domed roof above it. It really is palatial.The swimming pool with a gorgeous al fresco terrace for drinks or dining is divine, and daily yoga at 730am is a must, as the energy in the space is heavenly. You can stay in either the Palace or the Tower but the Palace is the spot. Rooms are beautifully, gently decored and include gorgeous light filled bathrooms, windows overlooking the courtyard in many cases, personal"
"Best hotel I've ever stayed in. We had two nights in the Tower. Lovely room and facilities. The hotel staff are amazing, so pleasant without being obsequious. Breakfast was lovely and we ate in the hotel both evenings as it was so good and very reasonable. Try the Indian wine. Cheap but delicious. I've never stayed in a hotel where it is a nice place to just hang out in but this one was. have a beer by the pool. Its idyllic. Luxury but very reasonably priced."
"I stayed for 2 nights in a Tower Room. I had the most sublime  views overlooking the Arabian sea and the Gateway of India. Very special indeed. The staff were delightful and very helpful, Breakfast was fabulous. The hotel lived up to my expectations, very luxurious."
"Stay here! This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at, hands down. Best service, great breakfast buffet, super location. WE are returning for another visit in a few days and look forward to enjoying a similar experience. "
"Fine heritage building Rooms are good, not great...and not appointed in five star style. Our expensive room did not have a bath, only a shower Large swimming pool, inadequate seating/lounger arrangements This is not a five star hotel when compared to global peers Over-priced Service is slow- and in the Club Lounge, very slow Breakfast disappointing - and be ready to queue"
"I stayed for 2 nights in a Tower room on a special rate. The hotel lobby and communal areas are lovely and definitely what sold it for me. The room was nice, but not amazing. I would stay again, but I wouldn’t pay rack rates. "
"If money is no option (although bargains can be found at the Taj, especially in the tower with it’s sublime views) then do yourself a favour and stay at the Taj, even if for one night.   If only to experience, no matter how briefly, one of the finest hotels in the world and all the joy and wonder that comes with that.   It goes without saying that the staff are exemplars of customer service and best the vast majority around the world. The beauty of the hotel itself is second to none and the facilities and impeccable.   Enough superlatives. Just go. "
"The Taj Mahal Palace lived up to all our expectations - luxury accommodation, great, friendly service, fabulous food, amazing, luxurious surroundings.  Sitting at the poolside sipping the worlds most expensive G&T's (!) takes you back to how it must have felt in the colonial era! be warned, the food and drink in the hurtle outlets are eye-wateringly expensive, but you have to accept that as part of the experience."
"I stayed with my family on 29th checked in and 31st we checked out. I booked my stay in the palace wing. The staff at this palace property is not at all pleasing. Hospitality is missing, staff unprofessional. Amarinder escorted us to our room. I requested him to let me know about heritage walk at the palace, I was informed that there is no vacancy for that day, tomorrow it may be possible as there was limited hearing machines. Next day none responded, if there is shortage then the management can arrange heritage walk twice or what ever the solution. Over all ignoring attitude. The staff is passing each day with burden.  They are 'dealing with customers' and 'not attending to guests'. I wish to message Mr Rattan Tata, and challenged him to stay here without disclosing his where"
Nothing is too much trouble for the staff here who give each and every guest an impeccable service.   We wanted eggs royals with spinach for breakfast and that’s exactly what we got and the chef came to check we were happy!   The palace rooms are gorgeous as are the forest essential toiletries. Opulence and tradition are the key values in this part of the hotel. Concierge were helpful in receiving our packages and ensuring they arrived safely to our room.   Pristine clean and feeling like a queen from the moment we arrived. Great afternoon tea and cognac.  The spa treatments continued the enjoyable experience and I felt totally blissed in our hotel transfer to the airport.   Wonderful and faultless stay!
"We had the most wonderful stay at The Taj Mahal Palace. We knew the story behind the hotel's construction & the incredible ethos of the Tata family. So we felt privileged to stay in such a magnificent hotel. But it was beyond our wildest dreams. The attention to detail is like nothing I've ever seen. The staff are so attentive, without being intrusive & attend to your every need before you even know you need it. One day I had left a novel on the desk in our room & we found house keeping had placed a hotel book mark on it when we returned from our sightseeing. Thank you Prashant for being so thoughtful.   We sent our shoes to the laundry for cleaning as we had been walking over farmland at our previous stop & they were quite muddy. We wouldn't normally ask to have them cleaned"
"Recently had this terrible experience at the Taj Mahal Palace wherein we were denied entry at the gate. The guy (who claimed to be the manager., but we were sure he was not) created a major ruckus giving us silly excuses.  If the coffee shop was full we could have waited at the lobby but this was not acceptable. Why do we need to plead to get into a Hotel? On knowing that we are Inner Circle members the other folks came up and apologized for this person's behavior.  While exiting the chief of security sincerely apologized for the entire incident., but the damage was done. It was a mentally agonizing moment us."
We felt in the Palace as if it was a world on its own with an amazing hospitality in a wonderful historic decor. Huge variety of food in the restaurants however the breakfast in the Palace is more limited. The courtesy of the staff is exceptional. The Maharat Suite was a very recommandable experience. The arrival to the hotel and the security felt stressful while the trip with the Taj driver to the airport was an uplifting lecture on history and the Tata family. The best address in Mumbai.
"It was my second time the Taj hotel, and it was as lovely as the first time, the first time I stayed in a City Room Club Old Building Room, this time, I moved across the corridor to a Sea View Room....Everything to make me go back a 3rd time stays the same, but,.......it's getting quite expensive......Yes I know about the local taxes being introduced, but, just got that feeling of, ""should it be that price, should it be ""that,"" expensive""...... The staff in the Sea Lounge deserve a Thanks from the Management, great advertisement for the Club Rooms..I gave a card giving my thanks on my last day. There is a fine dividing line between paying for an amazing hotel, and it's services, and thinking......""This is quite pricey now"",.....Just in case anyone thinks about me under"
"Every time I come to Mumbai I stay in this enchanting palace. The service is perfect, the location could not be better. I just wish to ad something about the Taj Inner Circle card. Even if I like the Taj hotels very much, I must complain about the Taj Inner Circle which NEVER works properly. Every time I stay in a Taj hotel I make sure that my card is registered and almost EVERY TIME the Taj Inner Circle do not register it and I must write again and again. They need almost six months to send a membership card. These guys should be fired immediately because they destroy the image of Taj hotels. Since I am staying in Taj hôtels and eat in Taj restaurant, I got only a few points and I never got the smallest advantage of being member."
"I have giving a top rating bc there's always room for improvement. And the Taj is no exception, but ""very good"" didn't seem quite right.  I was in the Tower. The room was small, but very nice. Every detail was thought out--every since used wisely.  I saw one of the Palace rooms, which was not huge, but lovely, with a lot of character. We only ate at the main restaurant off the lobby. Food was good and service was mostly great. (Apparently they won't move the outdoor tables to accommodate larger groups.) Breakfast is amazing--huge selection of delicious options.  The security is something to get used to, but not really a problem. The scent in the lobby was a little much. The bar off the lobby is small, but swank. I was expecting something grander. After a mishap with our airport"
"Upon arrival my first impressions observed a grand old building with 5 star interiors and well trained staff.  The Palace, not the tower, is the place to stay if budget is not an issue.  The hotel is well secured.  After 6 nights, I will keep my 5 star rating of the hotel, but only because there isn’t an option for 4.5 stars.  The breakfast food and service is about a 3 star rating.  The Spa is a 3 star rating at best because the facilities are very limited, and appointment availability due to capacity issues was scarce.  The rooms and public areas are well maintained, and very clean.  The location is fine, but do make your decision about whether you want to stay in this location or along Marine Drive.  I wouldn’t recommend staying in any other location within the city other"
Staying in this beautiful hotel felt like a privilege. The service is so gracious and pays great attention to your comfort. The architecture is beautiful and respectful of traditions. The room amenities were really great.
"It goes without saying that the Taj is one of the worlds best hotels, but a glorious building and grounds mean nothing without wonderful service. So we’d like to thank Dipeeka (possibly spelled Deepika!!) for looking after us. An oversight meant we arrived in the middle and of the night, exhausted, and way too early for our room. Dipeeka arranged an early check in, and for us to be treated to tea in the restaurant while we waited for our room to be readied, and then upgraded us to a magnificent sea view, including the Gateway of India. Thank you Dipeeka for your wonderful customer manner, your outstanding service and your attention to detail. Without people like Dipeeka working there, even a place like the Taj would be just bricks and mortar."
I stayed at this hotel for my anniversary and surprisingly the rooms at towers were small but never the less i enjoyed my stay at the hotel and the staff was very courteous.Food was nice and delicious.
I stayed at this hotel (in the Tower wing) for the first time last week although I grew up in Mumbai before moving to the US and I am familiar with most of the restaurants at the hotel. It was a wonderful experience in graciousness and hospitality. Everyone paid attention to your comfort from the intern to the liftman. I loved my modern room with all its amenities including little touches like beautiful tea mugs and a nice selection of teas. I will be back next year!
What a beautiful old building it is. Just opposite the Gateway of India so we decided to step in. The hotel was just outstanding and you can visit the shops and get a general feel of this wonderful hotel. The lobby was beautiful and the Christmas tree was still up which was adding to the festive cheer!
"I’ve had the pleasure of staying in a vast amount of fantastic hotels all over the world. Such as the Burj In Dubai etc; however, this was undoubtedly the most amazing experience I’ve had from a hotel. I stayed in the old palace wing in a fabulous suite.   Fast check in  Wonderful breakfasts with fab options  Kind and attentive staff  Faultless service- the staff stop and speak to you in the corridors, they even put bookmarks in your book for you in the room! (Attention to detail is magnificent)  Hotel smells constantly beautiful Pool is clean, spotless and wonderful  Used the spa a few times for treatments - the care and calmness is just astounding. I was even given a hand made necklace of lilies at the end of a facial!!!   My father has stayed in this hotel many times and he"
"A very iconic hotel with lots of charm and history.  The place is very popular with tourist and locals.  The service is very good, the restaurants list is comprehensive and the pool, spa and gym are a treat if you are staying there"
We actually had rooms in the new Tower on the 7 th floor directly overlooking the gateway. People watching was great fun. The whole hotel is beautiful and spotless. The tower rooms are less expensive than the older Place rooms. They are not as splendid but very comfortable non the less. You can use all the facilities of the Palace. Tea by the pool is a nice experience. It is like going back to the era of the Raj. Breakfast was buffet style with a great choice of food including freshly cooked to order. Only one criticism of the breakfast is that despite plenty of staff wandering about it was  frustrating to get coffee. One morning we ordered it from four waiters before it eventually arrived. The  breakfast staff seemed unsupervised at times. In the restaurants and bars this was
"Don't miss the opportunity to have a bite or tea at Sea Lounge in Taj Palace Hotel.The moment you enter the hotel you are surrounded in a cocoon of soft spoken friendly staff and hostesses in beautiful saris welcoming you, it is such a pleasant experience.  It was quiet busy at the lounge, however we were relocated to a window seat table where we had a view at the Gateway of India. I would like to thank the manager, Mr. Vinod for taking excellent care of us and his suggestions for the uplifting smoothies, tea and yummie victoria sponge. It was a true pleasure Mr. Vinod to be hosted by you and your team. Keep up the good work! I will definitely revisit."
"We arrived by plane at the Mumbai airport about 1:30 AM on a week night. We took a taxi to the hotel and were concerned that there may be no one on duty to check us in, but in fact, the hotel was active with staff. We were escorted to our lovely room and had a good nights sleep. This is a luxurious hotel where you are treated like royalty. A breakfast buffet was included in our room charge. You can take a tour of this historic place in the afternoons. We did not get the opportunity to do so, but if we ever go back here, we will. "
"Stayed for three nights in the tower wing. The hotel is large and busy, especially around the start of the new year. The grounds around the pool were a welcome refuge from the bustling heat of the city. There are loads of staff, and sometimes service was excellent but sometimes a little disorganised, hence a four star rating. The room was very modern and stylish (in the tower wing), and was well looked after by housekeeping and turndown staff. HUGE breakfast buffet with everything imaginable - you won’t need lunch! To me it felt more like a business hotel - it lacked the personal touch of other Taj hotels, but there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the stay, and, in fairness, the hotel was very busy. Location is excellent for the boat trip to Elephanta Caves (literally a"
"We have stayed here many times and it is good but overcrowded so the staff cannot do their best and often delay orders for food etc. Hence the 4 stars. However, I must praise one particular staff member, WAZIM, who checked us in at 4am - he was beyond helpful and did his best to do a speedy and efficient check-in for which we were grateful.He also helped with little details which were much appreciated."
"Upon arrival the check in was smooth and fast. The hotel pool and other common areas are beautiful and very well kept the rooms however which we were allocated were extremely basic and in my opinion not 5 star standard but more 4 star however they were very clean. We stayed in the newly built tower which is a bit cold and uninviting. The breakfast spread was very disappointing and the staff seemed to be overwhelmed by the busy Christmas rush. We ordered some snacks poolside and waited almost 45 minuets to even be served our drinks, I had to remind the staff of our order which only consisted of French fries and garlic bread.I really feel that we payed far too much money for what service we received. Overall a beautiful building but considering the high price it was below par for"
"Another great find. Very good hotel with amazing service and very friendly staff. It has 2 restaurants, Thai and south Indian. I have tried only south Indian one and that was amazing. Our waiter recommended to order thali and we were impressed by that. The food was served in dishes made of 5 elements which is not something you expect but was a good addition."
"We have stayed at this hotel before but on this visit we just popped in for gin and tonics at the Sea Breeze lounge just up the stairs from the ground floor. Here tea is served on a grand scale, and at grand prices, but we elected for cocktails only and were cordially received and served despite being visitors and not registered guests. Extra snacks of Bombay 'chat, and pelpuri were added as we sipped our G and T's accompanied by a pianist tinkling the ivories very competently on a nearby grand. Unfortunately, the furniture seemed out of place for this iconic hotel...the manager needs to take a page out of the Imperial Hotel's book on New Delhi. Otherwise delightful!"
"This was our 2nd trip to The Taj Mahal Palace and again it was FABULOUS. The room, hotel grounds, restaurants, spa, gym, shops, and truly wonderful staff made our 5 days at the hotel a trip to remember.  This hotel is Pure Luxury and faultless.  We came for my 50th Birthday and I received a present everyday from the staff, flowers, chocolate,s cakes and bangles. I have never been so spoilt  I cannot wait to travel back soon"
"Best hospitality you can imagine thanks to Deepika from Front Desk, Lalit from Houskeeping, Krish from Food&Beverage. It's got a character that you will never experience anywhere else. Thank You for an amazing decoration in room. Leaving the place felt like the end of something beautiful. "
"Stunning architecture, interesting history, fabulous pool, excellent breakfast.  Iconic building right on the Gateway of India, worth booking for the Heritage Walk which takes you through the history of the hotel."
"What to write about this palace my god every single thing is beyond par excellence service, staff , food, ambience ,cleanliness , everything means everything is superb it's must must stay if pocket allows u love to come back soon"
"From our traditional greeting to the staff and restaurants   Our stay was at the Palace not the Tower and it was out of this world in terms of room amenities , bed comfort , butler amazing and professional staff such an  iconic building with a rich and colorful history that welcomes you to India. Leaving The  Taj was the saddest day of all my trip around India but going back again this March"
"My son stayed there, he invited us the next day to look at the Taj . It was like I was in dream. The Palace was really beautiful and the stairs were amazing. Taj has all the charm and the finesse compared to a lot of the hotels I have seen. The suite he had booked was completely out of this world. Flowers everyone. The view from the window of the India gateway was amazing."
Second year we have been to the Taj Mahal for Christmas Day lunch.  The service was excellent. The food was wonderful. The atmosphere was lovely. A great alternative to a traditional Christmas lunch. Really good value for money and great fun as well.
"This is a beautiful hotel with truly wonderful staff. The Consiege was incredibly helpful and managed to solve several queries. We were at the hotel with friends who were celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary, I had bought a picture for them but the glass broke during our travels we were directed to a glass shop not far away and got the glass replaced for 50 rupees. The restaurant staff made a fabulous cake for us and the dinner we had in our suite to celebrate was wonderful. We had a birds eye view of the naval celebrations from our first room and then moved to a truly lovely suite. This is a very special hotel indeed.  "
"This hotel is amazing !! Highly recommended not only for its countless services but also for its location close to the Gateway of India. We stayed in for 4 days and they made us feel like a Royal family, caring to the minimun detail besides it is luxury and really really comfortable. It is one of the very best hotels we have ever been. Definetely we will come back."
We stayed at the Palace for 3 nights over Christmas period and were treated like royalty. Even though our travel agent made errors in our booking the staff went out of their way to solve our problems and made us feel at home. All facilities are top class. Amazing place to stay and if ever in Mumbai it is a must! 
"1. Excellent Property, Nicely maintained. 2. Gives a palacial look and preserved well. 3. Very courteous staff at The reception, Room Service, House keeping and in the restaurants. 4. Fantastic rooms equipped with all amenities. 5. Very good and tasty food served in room dining  and in Restaurants.  6. Good Breakfast spread ."
"We were upgraded from the Taj Palace Tower to the main Hotel, we were greeted by the assistant manager of reception, what a fabulous greeting, glass of juice greeting necklace, taken to a fabulous room 422, beautiful furnishings, bathroom toiletries, water, drinks and biscuits. We had access to some beautiful fresh tea in the Palace Lounge with home made biscuits. The swimming pool was so deep and relaxing. We ate in the main restaurant at night and had a gorgeous afternoon tea in the Palace lounge. The staff throughout the hotel were attentive charming and    very helpful. We did the guided tour of the hotel in the evening which was very inspiring. They have a commemorative wall and fountain in respect to the people who lost their lives in the bombing and we were privileged to"
"While this hotel has a pricey tag we think its superb location at the seaside in front of the landmark Gateway of India is very impressive and unmatched.    The service is up to high standard with highly attentive staff. Room is a bit small at the new tower section but we think the view is stunning particularly at sun rise, which is more commanding than the old and more expensive palace heritage building.   Breakfast has a goos variety of local and western food and you can choose a sea lounge or the ground floor restaurant.   Tips. If you stay at tower building with a view I recommend to have breakfast at the ground floor restaurant with a much more variety of foos than at sea lounge.   Also don’t miss walking to try a meal at the oldest restaurant in Mumbai, the leopard cafe"
"really nice hotel in Mumbai, India. Modern hotel next to historic building you get a glimpse of Indian welcome. Location is prominent and ideal for Mumbai city. Same as good European hotel but for India it is excellent."
"Whilst this is expensive compared to ordinary stays in India, this place is definitely out of the ‘ordinary’ and well worth paying to stay here for. It truly is a slice of luxury where you embrace the stunning surroundings filled with the most attentive and friendly staff ready to assist you at all times. The food is great, rooms are stunning, pool area is gorgeous. This ‘palace’ was extremely welcomed after a busy week doing the golden triangle. Definitely worth doing the hotel tour!!! "
Well... it is the Taj Palace. So comes with a lot of expectations and without an iota of doubt all expectations were well met and beyond. A very bustling place with a lot of activity in the reception area. A very beautiful lobby area. Smooth check-in. Ours was a sea-view room and just adored the view of the Gateway of India and myriad sail-boats strewn around. Liked the nights even better. Wah Taj... Wah...
"Beautiful building , nice scenic location and good place to take pics . Take a stroll along the sea visit gateway of India and dis place . Must visit place in Mumbai for fotos and if u can afford it visit inside too"
"Stayed here for our anniversary almost 4 years ago. After a small hiccup when they tried to put us in a room category below that for which we had paid, we were upgraded and had a fabulous stay and we determined to return. A couple of days ago we found ourselves in Mumbai and called in for a delicious lunch. We needed to access the Internet but we were told that wifi was only available for hotel residents and not lunch guests. If we had gone to McDonalds for lunch I'm sure we would have been ok. "
"After watching the BBC documentary on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel we wanted to stay there on our trip to India. The hotel is beautiful, our rooms were lovely with great views of the Gateway to India. Check in was great. Buffet breakfast was fantastic as was the service at breakfast. Airport transfers were great highly recommend organising this with the hotel. We got fruit & daily foot soaks in our rooms.  We met some great staff who were fantastic.  We decided to have some spa treatments at The Taj salon. Some treatments were good but way too expensive even by high quality Australian treatments.  Check what you ask for & how much it is. My mother & sister were overcharged. The attempt at pressure selling treatments is off putting & needs to stop.- there was a feeling of"
"we usually go for more modern hotels but this one was really worth it! their service is amazing and india hospitality at the maximum level and quality. Strongly recommend a club room. lots of amenities like free cocktails, free chocolate cognac & chocolate tastings and complimentary high tea. "
"Fantastic stay at Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, my favourite Hotel away from home. Everything is great, service, attention to detail, food, ambiance. They even remembered the kind of pillows we like (from our previous stay)! No trip to India would be complete without a stay here...."
This is an iconic hotel which has featured in many TV programmes. Go in and have a look around. The attendants are only too willing to help and if you have time have an experience not to be forgotten - afternoon tea.  Service is impeccable and the china cups and the tea they contained coupled with a variety of cakes was superb.
"Maybe when you buy into a brand such as Taj, the service quality you hope for this luxury hotel.  Dining at the Shamiana restaurant, you encounter staff that don't know the menu, don't know the differences between food and beverage items, and become overly aggressive.  I went there for breakfast and lunch, and they don't notify the guest ahead of time that you might have to wait 15 t0 25 min for your breakfast table.  Most of the staff there don't want to help if though they are manning the buffet.  The manager, Rahul also is quite pretentious.  The lunch was served cold, and when you mention that to them, the waiter gets angry.  The workers all seem miserable that they have to be there.  Bad service overall.  Opt for the Sea Lounge instead."
Taj Mumbai - Everything is a bit rundown but it's historical and probably the most famous in the country (especially after the 2008 Massacre). I felt the security at the entrance is still lacking. The service staff wasn't as helpful as I would expect from this level of hotel as it seems they were understaffed. Pick the sea view room on higher floor as it offers a nice panoramic view. 
After a 12 hour flight and 1 hour through customs then 1 hour taxi through the streets of Mumbai the first thing one would want is to swiftly get to hotel room. The lobby is an adventure on its own.... They first tell you to sit down in the plush sofas and then walk off with your passport. I was then greeted by 6 different people over a 15 min period just to check in (1 took passport another offered a beverage then another came back to confirm hotel accommodation details then another person came with a ritual/ necklace offering then another double checked on status of the check in process). Maybe I was frustrated by my long travels but waiting 15 min just to check in is not a pleasant experience. Instead of being greeted by half a dozen people please let’s try and make the
The taj mahal palace is one of my best hotel.the servise also too good. The food is delicious. I came with my family and we are planning to go again. The surrounding is best i have seen. There are all types of food varieties.
"I was there for just one night and stayed in the palace wing of the hotel. Everything ranging from the service to the staff, the food, the ambience was just perfect. One should definitely visit this place and stay for at least one night to experience such wonderful and luxurious life."
"I travelled for work with a cap on rates, so imagine my surprise when I checked in, to be told I was staying in the heritage wing of the hotel.  Everything about this hotel is simply marvellous, from its location, the restoration of the heritage wing to the food, the pool and especially the staff.  I would recommend all visitors to Mumbai spend some time at this hotel."
"I stayed here with my friend in February 2017 and it was an incredible stay.   Staff were almost psychically quick to sense a need and everything was always magically tidied up again almost before leaving the room.    I absolutely adored the floral displays in the entrances.    They were spectacular.    I loved the swinging seat and the live music too.   The flautist made it rather magical.       So many beautiful touches everywhere.    Loved the Sea Lounge and breakfast with classical music felt very civilised and the views from the windows were simply gorgeous.     If you would like to experience being treated like a king or a queen then I can say  that you will be for sure.    Respect, discretion and  formality abound.   It’s a very beautiful hotel and has amazing style.  "
An oasis in Mumbai! Beautiful historical hotel with the finest of finest. Excellent staff and restaurants. The most beautiful sunrise from our Buona Vista Suite....appropriately named. We would like to thank the entire staff for being so professional and accommodating especially Gaurav and Freda. Thank you for making everything perfect and happy holidays!
This hotel is very good luxury and 5 star fantastic hotel and very excellent service for all type facilities and good hot  breakfast also here their and staff is very honest and polite nature and cleanness is very excellent.
"Had booked a night stay for celebrating my first wedding anniversary and giving a surprise to my wife - Turned out to be a disappointment. Other than the beauty of the property and housekeeping/room service people who were good, totally disappointed with the response and lack of attention from the front desk team.  Summing up: - Prior to my check-in I had requested for a room decor and had made MULTIPLE EMAILS and CALLS to confirm the same so as to have a smooth check-in (have even informed the time of arrival) and they assured me not to worry on that. - On arrival - hardly any assistance, where to go, whom to meet in the quit big lobby - After locating the front desk, there were atleast 3 people (none of them were warm or looked willing to help). And I had to literally ask"
"We had a fantastic meal in this new Indian restaurant in Navan. The food was prepared perfectly and was full of flavour. We shared 6 different starters and main courses between us. Highlight for me was the chicken Shaslik and Lamb Saag. The Saag was not on the menu but was specially prepared. The staff were welcoming and helpful. Although the food was slow to arrive, I think this was due to the perfectionist standards of the chef. We all agreed that this was top class food.  I look forward to my next visit to Taj Mahal."
"Goodness me! What a fabulous place to stay!  This is the best hotel experience I have ever had, across the world.  The staff are fabulous, and nothing is too much trouble for them. Service is carried out with efficiency and a genuine want to make the guest happy.   The hotel room was exceptionally clean, containing a luxury en suite bathroom. Most of the TV channels are in English and the wifi works well in the bedroom. Breakfast is lovely, as expected. The bed is huge and very comfortable.  The hotel was stylishly decorated for Christmas, and there is a thoughtful memorial wall and fountain for the poor people who perished in the 2008 attack. Lucy the hero dog is also mentioned :)   Guests are welcomed on arrival with an Indian necklace, and a farewell gift was given to us of a"
"The hotel is beautiful, exceptionally clean, and a wonderful place to spend time while in India. The restaurants and food were delicious and there was something for everyone on the menus. We ended our two week India trip at this hotel and would not have changed a thing! The staff is absolutely incredible and very helpful. We cannot say enough about what an amazing experience we had at this hotel. Definitely recommend!!!"
"My first visit to mumbai, so I wanted to experience the most out of it.  Taj mahal palace is one of the most expensive hotel in mumbai but my night booked with this hotel was not that great.  Lot of things happened & All I got was an apology.  1). Noise was coming in rooms because of some construction work. Thought to have a nice nap after breakfast but that noise made me checkout asap. Same noise was heard at reception also, so I asked lady on front desk to hear it and she apologize for the same.  2). Breakfast buffet is not upto mark, very less variety or basic variety which you can have in any other 5 star category hotel. Nothing special which makes it THE TAJ MAHAL.  3). This was shocking that my car was not offered to me on porch. It was parked outside the main entrance"
"check in - very quick and efficient . I was accompanied to my room in the old palace wing to complete the arrivals forms,  and offered a drink both in the lobby as well as once i reached my room .  room - a beautiful room in the palace wing , overlooking the pool and city . Furnished to a very high standard . I had booked a room on their diwali rate , and was given an upgrade to include club benefits - unlike at the Taj in Delhi a few days prior , the staff here seemed to know exactly what the rate included , and had even emailed me before my arrival to confirm these . There was huge comfortable bed - great linen and bed covers , a large armchair , desk area and huge tv with a very good range of channels available in English. Some welcome snacks were provided . Since it was over"
"Definitely a must visit, very beautiful icon opposite to Gateway of India, very beautiful place, lots of tourists and locals, amazing restaurants, lots of stores for shopping high end, staying in the hotel would be a life time experience. "
"Taj has unmatched hospitality in India ..superb welcome at arrival ,given special privilege being Taj member for check in , city view is okie but palace room is awesome with view ..In dinning facility and food is just awesome ."
"The hotel is ideally situated and is superb in every aspect. In summary you feel the warmth from the moment you are picked up at the airport, the check in is done at a blink of an eye lid and is done as you are escorted to your room.  I booked a suite and a Club room, and both were stellar.  Great service, great staff, and a must for every discerning traveller"
Please note high tea is inly between 3:30-6:30pm but the sea-view lounge remains open till late. Missed the afternoon tea.. but the snacks i had was one if the best iv had .. waiters were wonderful .. cant wait to go again.. amazing views of the gateway of india and the boats 
"The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is the really the oldest and the unique property that Mumbai has with us .If ever took about Mumbai city ,Taj is always known  Guys i have stayed here with my family the unique architecture of the building the behavior of the staff the maintenance every thing is really beautiful . Food here was very lovely"
"This is an absolutely fabulous hotel!  The staff are so attentive and polite, from the very first welcome throughout our whole stay .. they couldn't do enough for you.  We were very lucky to be upgraded to the Palace wing as it was my husband's special birthday, the room was spacious, the bed was large & comfy, the bathroom was luxurious - marble everywhere containing very good toiletries, and different flower petals displayed in the room & bathroom on a daily basis! Breakfast was out of this world with a huge array to choose from.  Again the staff couldn't do enough for you, you do feel thoroughly spoilt and special staying here.  We booked the hotel car to pick us up from airport in the early hours to avoid any potential hassles ... and the chap arrived in his hat and white"
"What a grand old lady Super food, super comfortable non-guest accommodations Brilliant shops Worth walking around the block - visit Good Earth and Starbucks at the rear-side of the hotel Take a horse-drawn carriage trip around the area too "
We met with friends for lunch & were blown away with the style and beauty of the place.  Food was lovely. But more impressive was the helpfulness of the staff. We chose European dishes as we had teenagers with us & chef was very accommodating of our daughter's gluten free needs. 
"My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights. The service from front-desk, concierge, housekeeping and waiters at breakfast was professional throughout - everyone was happy to greet you with a smile!  Room: We were upgraded to the Heritage wing having initially booked to stay in the Tower which was a lovely surprise. Housekeeping was regular with night turndown service and the room was always spotless!  Location: Situated right opposite the Gateway of India, it has a pretty central location. Despite the busy location, the rooms are quiet. There are a lot of shops nearby such as Sabyasachi, Ensemble etc that are of a walkable distance if you are in Mumbai to shop but otherwise places are just a taxi ride away. There are a lot of good quality restaurants and bars nearby too."
"Everything about this hotel is excellent. Superb service, food, room and location. The attention to detail is evident. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We stayed in a room in the new annex so don't know how the rooms are in the original building but can't imagine that they could be any better."
"After 4 countries  I have visited and countless hotels, my most favourite in the world is the Taj Mahal Palace. The Spa is sumptuous and the technicians skilled and accommodating. The rooms have everything one could want being lavishly appointed. But most outstanding is the buildings themselves which inside and outside are so beautiful that its hard to believe this is not a dream. I felt transported back to centuries as if I were dwelling in a palace itself. I was there for almost one night and day and I never left the grounds because I did not want to leave this perfection. The food was gourmet and of numerous cuisines and the staff were attentive yet with deference. I never felt alone...always pampered like a princess but with great respect in every part of the hotel.  Special"
"Wonderful location. Sea facing and opposite the gateway of India. It has a lovely decor. Superb swimming pool. Even if you do not stay there it is worth going for the high tea in sea lounge. You will get the normal cakes, teas, coffees and also India street food like pani puri,chaat,pav bhaji etc.  The staff have a wonderful way of making your stay pleasant."
"So glad I stayed in the original Hotel. They are building a new Tower. The Reception area, Hallways, central staircase are amazing. They have increased Security to a very high level. So many staff so willing to cater to your every need. Yoga in the early morning. Wonderful buffet breakfast. I enjoyed lunch in the Souk restaurant at the top  and afternoon tea in the Sea Lounge. Wonderful swimming pool."
"We were in Mumbai for a meeting and stayed at the Palace and found it to be a wonderful experience.   The staff were lovely and the grounds very inviting and in particular the pool area.   When I checked in ( a day ahead of my husband), I mentioned in passing that it was his birthday in a few days.  The hotel sent up cake, flowers, and balloons-  all without request ( or charge!).  It was so thoughtful and appreciated.   My only mildly negative comments are that the room we stayed in was rather small and had a pretty musty/stale smell from the humidity.   Overall, though we were really pleased and would stay again!"
"I have been privileged to stay in many fine hotels around the world, but this was the best experience ever and far surpasses any 5star hotel I have ever used. On reading TA reviews I booked a club room in the heritage wing. Included in this was a one way transfer, so the driver was waiting for us on arrival into Mumbai airport after an internal flight from Jaipur. The air conditioned SUV was very welcome in the Mumbai heat. The driver( I think his name was Shevan ) was so pleasant, entertaining and informative that the ride went by in a flash. We were met at the hotel entrance and taken straight to our room without having to register in the lobby. It was a pleasant surprise to receive an upgrade to a sea view room as a gesture to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday. This was"
"It was a delicious lunch at The Taj Mumbai. The staff was very best. The service quality was amazing. We order biryani. I feel It was just like prepared by my mom, feel like I am taking it in my own kitchen."
"This is Magnum Opus version of Hotel. It is beautiful with everything just perfect be it lobby, customer service and the beautiful room. Stayed in the palace wing and absolutely loved the feel of the room. We had birthday celebration, they decorated room with balloons, bouquet and a cake, it was lovely. Staff is extremely courteous, breakfast at sea lounge is mind blowing. It's an experience to cherish. "
"We stayed here for the last four nights of our recent trip to India.  We arrived here after leaving Cyclone Ochki in Kovalam so immediately appreciated the tranquillity of the place, from the moment we were greeted by our chauffeur on leaving the airport.  We stayed in a Palace wing club room on the 5th floor, with the most amazing views over the Gateway to India.  This place oozes class and is a step back in time to bygone times, nothing was too much trouble for the staff.   We took breakfast in the sea lounge and ate in Chambers and Masala Kraft, the service and food everywhere was excellent.  We have vowed to return and would recommend it to anyone."
"The Taj is opulent and a unique experience. Everything is nice, luxurious and comfortable (and it smells divinely jasmine everywhere). The foyer, the flower pieces, lots of nice shops and restaurants. We booked a Club Room, which extends further luxury : separate check-in & special floor with service, garment pressing, afternoon tea with sensational snacks, evening cocktails, chocolate and cognac. Breakfast is elaborate and delicious. All this, however, comes at a steep price and Mumbai is very competitive (Sofitel BKC is just as luxurious and probably more sophisticated - at less than half price) ; you are paying premium for the name and excellent reputation. Still, it is a great special treat and I'll be back."
"I entered the palace to just buy a cup of tea and realised that the cost of tea is covered with alot of services, make sure to go to the top floor to see the city view from the palace and make yourself feel like a king. Rooms provided are clean and best in city"
"We had one night in this hotel. Our room was at the front of the modern tower part of the hotel with views of the Gateway of India. The room was spacious and well appointed. The bathroom was compact with a good size shower cubicle,washbasin and toilet.The buffet breakfast was good but the waiters seemed disorganised. However we had a waiter service dinner with a choice of main course and that was very satisfactory."
I took 6 family members here as a surprise for my mum's 60th. The place is incredible and the food choices were amazing. I had gone via a recommendation and I would definitely recommend it. It's a long drive from where we were staying in Juhu but it was well worth it.
"I have stayed at all of the best hotels in the world and hands down, the Taj Palace is the best. I cannot tell you how incredible this place is. Every hour I had gifts in my room, I was upgraded, not once but several times to suites when I had bought a budget low price booking.com room. The staff is incredible, next level. The buffet breakfast is a MUST, its everything you can every imagine to eat, and if they dont have it, they will source it for you. In the old wing ask for Floor 3 as the butler Rahul is a HOOT. He will have you laughing and playing in that hotel like a child travelling for the first time. Santish is the best concierge in the world. When I was there my visa expired and he personally took me to meet the commisioner to have this rectified. He is in an wilte"
"It's a bit expensive but your money worth it,  service is high quality and the time spending there was a great treat,  so highly recommend to stay there atleast one day I enjoyed my time, I really mean it thank you. "
"This hotel has been one of the historic place in Mumbai, The cuisines and stay both are excellent best suited for foreigners. also the place where it is located gives a nice view of the Arabian sea which adds to its value"
"We just checked in for one day. Our flight is at 2 am tomorrow. I would say this is one of the nicest hotels in India with the the Taj in Jodhpur. Our room is on the fifth floor overlooking the sea . Checking was done in a split of a second  the staff is professional  and will take care of your needs. Beautiful interior decoration done with taste not too ostentatious, just right . You will find a shopping arcade Louis Vuitton & more , a nice choice of restaurants  ,an international a la carte, an Indian Masala Kraft ,wasabi a Japanese restaurant ,the Souk on the rooftop . We had lunch at the Chinese “ the golden Dragon “India s first Sichuan and Cantonese restaurant , it was excellent ! This is maybe more of girls thing :)but after 2 weeks in India I was happy to  see that there"
Excellent 20 Lebanese starters with a view of the Bay that's breathtaking. The Chefs & Anselym were very interactive so it was an excellent learning & eating experience. Surprised me with a birthday cake which I cut & took home for my children. A memorable experience to cherish
This is a classic hotel with modern flair blended with historical classical features. The staff are very attentive and rooms are well equipped. The wonderful pool in the old read gardens beneath the dome is atmospheric and reeks of colonial times. Food was good and highly recommended.
"As city hotels go, this ranks among the best we have stayed in on many levels.  The rooms were clean, the bed and pillows very comfortable, the bedsheets sumptuous.  We had a view out front overlooking the harbour and the Gateway of India, which was lovely, but we were subjected to a certain amount of street noise, especially from car horns.  Ironically, the windows were double glazed, which should have suppressed the noise, but the seal between the two windows was poor, and hence the intrusive level of noise, even on the 5th floor.  The hotel is beautifully furnished, and visually impressive, both inside and out.  Lovely art work within (paintings / sculptures), and also stunning flower arrangements.  Service throughout was impeccable, as you would expect at this standard of"
"Simply amazing Hotel. Enjoyed dinner. Food quality and service is awesome.  Great place to be at in Mumbai. Location is simply amazing, opposite Gateway of India.  See facing view is breathtaking. Must visit "
"Best place for foreigners to stay. Very comfortable spacious rooms. The service, food, cocktail and, tea time was delicious. Each server catered to your every need. Very close to a lot of the touristy sites too. "
"Impeccable service from the moment of arrival.  Spacious and beautifully furnished room overlooking the Gateway of India.  Wide selection of beverages and well-stocked bar in room.  Didn’t have time to try the Japanese restaurant, but the Chinese, Indian and Lebanese restaurants were excellent as was the club sandwich lunch we enjoyed at the poolside restaurant.  The buffet breakfast offered an amazing choice of dishes and catered for all tastes. Lovely swimming pool and particularly appreciated regular provision of cold water and even chilled fresh fruit. Service throughout was attentive and friendly yet discreet and I can’t praise the staff of the hotel highly enough."
"I stayed for 6 days to attend a wedding. The service of housekeeping on the 18th floor was outstanding. No request was too difficult and the team had always a smile on tbeir face. Daily breakfast buffet at Shamiana was a delight and Anant Mishra, Assistant Manager, went beyond his duty to look after his guests. Highly recommanded to experience true Bombay hospitality!"
"We've been in a lot of hotels almost all over the world, but Taj Mahal Mumbai was the most outstanding one. Starting from the beginning when we were picked up from the airport till the hotel staff escorted us the last day of our stay - everything was perfect! Everyday we were getting some surprises (rose petals in the room, coloring books, teddy bear, a flower bouquet, chocolate and more) , moreover the staff noticed our little habits and had them off real quick, which amazed us. None of our requests was declined, even though we had not a little bit of them!(: The service is literally remarkable! Thank you for hospitality and amazing experience, hoping to visit you soon. :)"
"This is a superb hotel with a service, which is almost on par with the Mandarin in Hong Kong.   It is discreet, well located, has a fascinating history and, understandably, security is very tight.   Rooms are large and spacious and harbour view rooms overlook the Gateway to India. Bathrooms are large with both shower and bath tub.   The hotel offers a number of restaurants. I was recommended the Japanese, which was excellent.   The hotel at is not up to much and if I were to level criticism, this would be it. A hotel in this price range and reputation really should present its customers with a better, more classic watering hole!  I mentioned the service, which is really quite out of the ordinary. Staff will literally stop what they are doing, drop everything to help you with"
"Booked three nights in the Tower Wing but arrived looking very bedraggled at two in the morning thus loosing much of the first night of the stay. Immediately upgraded to the Palace, nothing too much trouble for the amazing staff, exquisite rooms and facilities. One of the best hotel breakfasts I've ever experienced. Food and drink on the poolside terrace are perhaps a little pricey but the service and setting do compensate. Security is very tight."
I didn't stay here but I went here and had lunch with a group of friends.   Their was a wide choice of foods available and a combination of different cuisines.   The service was amazing and our favourite thing was the Pani Puri you cant beat it in India. Their is a wide variety to choose from to suit your taste.  So If you are in Mumbai for a visit go and have lunch or a tea at the hotel.
"A truly remarkable hotel in Mumbai with top class setting, service, food and design. the hotel maintains its elegance and provides comfort with the best of service. I have to say a big thank you for a most enjoyable stay."
"We stayed at the Taj Palace in May 2016, so this time we booked to stay at the Taj Tower Wing (being much cheaper then the Palace wing)  First up, we arrive - get the welcome drinks and the oh-so-refreshing lobby foyer of the hotel.  Check-in is painless and *suprise* they're putting us up in the Palace Wing!  Free Upgrade FTW!  I dont have to explain how spotless and luxurious rooms are.  Their attention to detail is next level,   1) we left our laptop and charging cables on the table, when we arrived later in the day, we saw all our cables neatly tied up with free velcro cable ties. 2) our toiletries in the bathroom was neatly arranged on the glass shelf and put on a little white cloth. 3) i left my sunglasses on the side table, when we arrived in the evening. turn down"
"This hotel is a real gem and I would go as far to say our favourite hotel in India. We have visited India 5 times and always tie in at least two nights at the Taj Palace, usually at the start and end of our trips. The hotel is beautiful, all the staff are exceptional- nothing is ever too much trouble. The hotel is spotless, service round the pool and in the restaurants is always fantastic, and the leisure facilities all you would need for a business or leisure break (the inclusion of the complimentary yoga was also the perfect start to our morning). We were upgraded to a palace wing room and enjoyed the additional benefits available, including delicious afternoon tea in the palace lounge overlooking the gateway of India, and the cognac and chocolates served in the evening."
Its my first trip to india and stayed in this hotel. i have stayed here 2 nights.simply say its a wonderful day of my trip to india. The breakfast in shamiana is the best.they got a lot of selection of foods. Heritage walk at taj art gallery was great. Everything was a memory in Taj
"forgot to mention  it is indeed a very good idea to go for the Taj airport drop  a Taj Airport Service Manager will do the needful from the moment you step out of the vehicle till you step into security and immigrations  Sanjeeb Chakravarti (Manager Airport Service, Taj Bengal) received us and helped us with the trolleys and our suitcases ; he checked us in, got our boarding cards, and even went to pay the extra baggage charges on our behalf ;  he saw us off till the immigration gate  everything done smoothly thumbs_upOK_hand  we give him a 10 on 10 for the service keycap_10 "
We stayed here for two nights in mid November and could not have asked for better. We had a sea view room in the old palace which was everything you could wish for. The room was large and airy with a large comfortable bed. The service at the hotel was unparalleled and nothing was too much trouble from the time we arrived until we departed. Special mention should be made of the concierge Sanjay who could not have been more helpful and always wanted to know if the recommendations he had given were good. A very special hotel.
"We stayed for 3 nights in October'17 in the Taj club room.  On arrival in Mumbai, we were picked up by our Taj driver at the airport. This was where our Taj experience began.   Chauffeured in comfort (with complimentary wifi and radio menu) for the hour long drive from the airport we arrived at the Tower lobby only to be greeted by the friendly staff and a traditional welcoming ceremony. We were escorted to the Palace wing to our amazing room on the 6th floor where luxurious heritage meets ultimate comfort.  The check-in was so swift that it was completed when we got to our room. From marbled bathrooms with in-mirror TV and Bose sound systems to our super-comfortable king bed with an excellent view of the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea, every little detail in the room made"
"We stayed one night at this majestic hotel and wish it had been longer, From the time we arrived until we left we were looked after and taken care of.  A 'snag' that we encountered at lunchtime was very quickly taken care of and put right, all credit to the professionalism of the managers and staff. We are planning our next visit to this landmark hotel."
"The hotel is in two parts.  There is the new Tower and the old palace.  We were booked into the Tower but were kindly upgraded to the palace, maybe because we stayed in quite a lot of Taj hotels. The reception area is a massive area of sheer luxury with magnificent flower displays.  It has a real buzz to it with so many people coming and going but still we were made very welcome on arrival and were able to relax straight away. Having been fortunate enough to be upgraded we also were able to experience the old part.  It has a central staircase like no other - worth just going to have a look at it.  The room was everything you would expect and the views over the Gateway to India and the bay were magnificent. There are so many hotels in Mumbai but this one is a little bit special."
"From reception upon arrival to departure, this hotel may not have a rival. The hotel was buzzing with activity when we arrived early evening, yet the reception and concierge staff were devoted to our smooth entry to their property and to our comfort. The lobby in the Tower is very large and never having been there, we were escorted to comfortable seating and reassured of the business of getting to our rooms. High up in the Tower property, our rooms were impeccable. The blond maple doors and wood panels, the accent lighting, the subtle yet well thought through appointments to the hallways and rooms were magnificent- the accomplishments of tasteful and talented designers. Our first night in the main dining room was heralded by the manager proclaiming a special multiple course meal"
"Amazing Grand Old Lady of a hotel.  The staff were polite and attentive; the food (from a selection of outlets) was very good and the ""heritage decor"" was inspiring.  If you are in Mumbai, do consider staying here - it is a tad pricy but well worth the expense,"
"Of course, the design and beauty of this establishment is as luxurious and gorgeous as one would expect. But the level of service at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel surpassed everything else we experienced on our trip to India. And it was sustained throughout our stay in subtle and thoughtful ways, not just the obvious and usual level of service. The day we went to Elephanta Island, there were two brass bowls filled with rose petals awaiting us on our return. All that was needed was the addition of hot water and salts to ease our aching feet. And there was no drawing of that water ourselves – there was a handwritten card instructing us to call our butler for assistance, so of course we did! So the lovely Arif prepared our footbaths and told us that he would leave the bowls with us"
"Third time we have stayed here when in Mumbai, always a wonderful experience.  Room was very clean - we had a bath and a shower.  Restaurant venues and menus were a good mix of western and Indian cuisine.  Try to book a room with a view of the Gateway - stunning at dawn."
"Hotel : The Taj overlooks the majestic Gateway of India and is at a walkable distance from Colaba Causeway. Interior : Just Fabulous! Has few retail outlets in-house. Is kind of mini museum because it has a lot of artefacts in-house. Cleanliness : Spotless. No Second Word! Housekeeping Staff : Very helpful, Cheerful, courteous and helpful. Reception and Other Staff : Excellent. Well behaved and ever helpful. Overall WOW!  One of the best in the Hotel Industry in the World! Special Mention : It was a in my bucket list to be here. I had probably told them about it. They spared no stone unturned to make this stay a very special one. A in-house staff from who worked in Dubai earlier (Sorry forgot her name) made that extra effort of making the stay a really memorable for me and my"
I had visited the Taj for a high tea during my holiday in India. The cakes and tea are very delicious and the window view with the Gateway of India made it even more special. Special thanks to Vinod who made our high tea in the Taj Hotel a memorable experience!
"What an amazing piece of architecture, a truly stunning building with exceptional service (especially the gentleman on the travel desk), good food and wonderful ambiance, we extended our stay by a night but wish we could have stayed longer.  My only grip was that while we were there the pool was closed."
"Magnificent hotel in Mumbai everything can only be described as top class, food,staff and the decor and having stayed in many five star hotels around the world this hotel is up there among the top few, I have to say a big thank you for a most enjoyable stay. Bernard Carter"
Outstanding service from the airport pickup to departure.  Recomend staying at the Palace wing in a Taj Club room.  Arrive early for breakfast as it can be crowded.   Awesome sense of history and tradition walking through the hotel.  Wonderful meals at most of the onsite restaurants.  One restairant I would avoid is the Souk.  Go to the Souk to see the view - top floor overlooking the Gateway of India.  It had good service and ambiance but sub-standard meals.
"Spectacular and majestic - the Taj is the the best hotel in which we've stayed. We enjoyed our time here so much that we continued to extend our stay in Mumbai, adjusting our itinerary and bypassing other destinations further north so that we could stay longer. Rooms were extremely comfortable in the 'old' wing and we really enjoyed the club privileges, especially the views over the Arabian Sea and Gateway of India from the club breakfast room, although we also enjoyed breakfast around the pool on a number of occasions. Staff were exceptional, especially concierge who went out of their way to organise theatre tickets, street food and Divali tours (both sensational) and tried very hard to secure tickets to a sold out charity T20 game, which was a (very hot) highlight of our trip"
"Being a Mumbaikar, opted for this property as a staycation for a day ... to experince the charm of this iconic hotel while taking a day off from the Mumbai life.    True to its name and reputation, the hotel is iconic and a must go to place for  international tourist wanting to experince the charm of Mumbai as well as some of the big names of the Indian business.  The hotel has had a major role in some of the big events that have shaped Mumbai to what it is, including the 26/11 terrorist attacks on Mumbai.  Being an iconic hotel representing Mumbai, it was one of the targets of the attack .. and even after that it represented the spirit of Mumbai, when it opened up again despite some heavy damages .. truly epitomizing the spirit of Mumbai.  In its new avatar, the Taj Mahal"
"A wonderful stay at the Taj Palace Hotel in Mumbai, a hotel that is worthy of its name ""Palace"".  The staff, the service and the amenities provide an ultimate place to stay.  The decor of the Palace is second to none, the welcome on arrival is warm and friendly.  The Hotel lack little in terms of service and facilities and was a majestic location near the Gateway of India."
This hotel is situated located in good place and very good value for money and excellent food in breakfast is also and staff is very honest and helpful also and I have second time in Mumbai to stay next time also my experience in this hotel is away some. 
The Taj Mahal Palace exudes travel in the time of the Raj when the older part of the hotel was built. The grand common spaces and the hallways are filled with museum quality paintings and furnishings. Our room was decorated old style with a wonderful view of the Gateway to India and the harbor My only complaint was the shower went from freezing to boiling with no control over the temperature. The staff was wonderfully trained and were a pleasure to interact with. The breakfast in the Sea Lounge was marvelous and the staff amazing.
"This is the place to be when visiting Mumbai. Try to stay at the Palace rooms at least for a night, it is a must. The old glory with modern amenities.  The bathroom had a window overlooking the view outside.   The service was outstanding and it is a must to do the 45min Palace tour to know about the rich history of this hotel "
"This was an exceptional hotel experience.  Everything about my stay was 5 stars.  The hotel is beautiful, there is a full range of amenities, including spa treatments I would highly recommend.  The best part is the staff.  Each and every person was helpful, skillful, and welcoming.  "
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a truly great Hotel right on the oceanfront in Mumbai next to the Indian Gate. The property is beautifully appointed in the public spaces and the rooms. But what really sets this hotel apart, like all of the best hotels, is the people. The staff, without fail is gracious and helpful. Highly recommend"
"My friend and I decided to shout ourselves to a few nights here at the end of a 5 week holiday touring India.  It was a great decision, the location is perfect, the hotel is stunning, all of the staff are wonderful and the pool area is beautiful and relaxing. I would almost go back just to stay there again. I am also tired of buffet breakfasts but theirs is not to be missed. The security was also excellent, I felt very safe there."
"We backpacked staying in very budget hotels and hostels until the end of our trip where we stayed in Mumbai and decided to stay in this hotel as a final treat. This hotel is outstanding. Security is high but in a comforting way, upon entering you immediately feel calm especially in comparison to the streets of mumbai. The staff are friendly, smiley, chatty and cannot do enough for you. The decor is beautiful and there are so many flowers, that the whole place smells beautifully floral all the time. The breakfast was delicious, varied and of an extremely high quality and the staff are very good at remembering your face and details which is just one of those added touches that great staff can offer to make you feel special. I could not rate this place highly enough. It is high end"
"Greeted at the airport, relaxing journey to the hotel. Stayed 7 nights in a club room in the Palace wing on the sixth floor which was very quiet. From start to finish service was excellent. All staff are a credit to the hotel, polite and smiling. Many times greeted by name. Lovely breakfast in the Sea Lounge overlooking Gateway of India. Sumptuous afternoon tea in the Club Lounge and evening cocktails in the evening. Never a problem finding loungers at the pool which is an oasis away from the busy streets outside. Excellent in room house keeping. The decor in the Palace is stunning, every floor has some thing different. Security is good and key is needed to access the elevators to the upper floors. Took the heritage tour between1730-1830 really interesting. Would love to go back."
"The Taj Mahal Palace was fabulous! The room was lovely, dining options were terrific and the spa fabulous! We enjoyed our time at the beautiful pool and even shopped a little bit in the lovely shops. The service was wonderful. We had a lovely view from our room. If I ever return to Mumbai, I will definitely return to this amazing hotel."
"We stayed at the Taj Palace for 3 nights, fantastic location, fantastic rooms, fantastic building and fantastic views.    However, the staff..... whilst looking very efficient and appearing very efficient were actually quite inefficient. For example at breakfast they would seat you and then you would wait an age for someone to ask if you wanted coffee or tea, once you ordered your coffee or tea it would arrive (and it did on all 3 occasions) AFTER you had finished your breakfast.  I don't understand why in a 5* hotel, something so simple took so long. The staff all milled around looking very busy but nothing was happening, it was strange to say the least.  The spa was not an enjoyable experience, I ordered a 90 minute massage and half way through the massage a noise which can"
"Taj Palace Mumbai is one of the heritage properties of the Taj group. It is situated right next to the Gateway of India, South Mumbai.   Taj group of hotels are known for their hospitality and a certain old world charm. This hotel is no exception.   At the time of arrival, one is greeted with a 'Namaskar -the traditional indian greeting with folded hands' and a 'tika' and a garland of marigold flowers or basel wood. This really bowls one over.   My room was very aesthetically furnished. The mini bar had good variety and the cost was also reasonable. The rose petals near the bathroom, a little gift on the writing table and a good selection of newspapers, magazines, tea and coffee were enough to tickle my sense of importance.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  The morning breakfast"
"This is basically everything you would expect a top class hotel to be.  Service great, food good, great swimming pool. And great architecture.  We were lucky to have a room overlooking ‘Gateway of India’ which was very atmospheric when we were stood on the balcony watching the world go by.  Just remember that with such a hotel the cost of food and drink is not cheap but if this is somewhere you probably will not visit again it is well worth if.  "
Fantastic. We loved pretending  to be ladies while enjoying  high tea at the Taj. Service was impeccable. Surroundings inside are stunning. High tea it self was wonderful in the sky lounge. A must when in Mumbai.
"Everything about this hotel, from first being met in the foyer with a drink and a necklace showed it as one of the world's great hotels. The pool is magnificent, the rooms wonderful and the service attentive, friendly and efficient. Every detail you could need seems catered for."
"Had an extremely good experience staying at Taj Colaba.  Proximity to the sea and the view of the Gateway of India was amazing especially since it was Monsoon month. Good eateries nearby.  Had stayed only for 3 nights, but it was worth it."
My wife and I stayed for two nights and we will be staying again at the end of our 4 week trip around southern India. We had a room in the new section with a fabulous view overlooking the gateway to India.  The staff are all smart and courteous and every aspect of the service is top class.
"Wonderful historic hotel, full of atmosphere, flawless service, excellent amenities, truly breathtaking architecture and history.  Stayed here for four days in early November and it made the testing business trip more than tolerable.  A home from home."
My family stayed at the Taj for one night in the month of September. The room was amazing and spacious. Service at the Taj is always excellent. Sea view from the room was also awesome. We stayed during Ganpati Visarjan and enjoyed the processions going by as well. Everything was going great when in the morning whilst sound asleep we heard noise of construction work. The one night stay was only for rest & relaxation and that was disturbed due to repair work going on with their property all morning to checkout. We informed the same to the reception upon checkout and they did apologise for the same but sleep was gone.
An amazing hotel with immaculate service absolutely underpinning every aspect. Brilliantly located with our room overlooking the Gateway to India and the ocean - unforgettable. Slightly set the bar rather high for the rest of our 4 week trip around India!
"Spent two nights here and felt like royalty... just loved the place and we were well looked after, from the minute we arrived. Our room looked out to sea with a view of the gate... If you are visiting Mumbai a stay here is a must!"
"A beautiful hotel with a lot of history. Very glamourous in décor with speciality shops everywhere. Beautiful lobby and looking very expensive. Not cheap, so it will blow the budget, If you want style, this is hotel. Fantastic  swimming pool  area, a great way to relax.   Did find the incense odour especially in the designer shopping areas was too overbearing and we had to leave."
"Situated opposite the famous India Gate facing the water.  The Taj palace is a genteel , elegant hotel that has been beautifully maintained with 6 star service.  The heritage wing rooms are huge and we were upgrade to a corner suite.  A real old world feeling with enough cosseting through fine bed linens and little rose petal details on the floor and bath counters to welcome you home.   The architecture is resplendent and there is a heritage tour to show you parts of the building and snippets of information and pictures of illustrious guests through the period.   A stones throw from the India gate which provides a nice stroll in the early morning or evening. If you can get a member of the Royal Bombay  yacht club to sign you in, visit to get a feel of what Bombay was like in the"
"Beautiful hotel let down by so much noise right through the night. I’m typing this at 2:30am and they have been hammering away in the function room since 10pm. Great hotel spoiled by zero sleep due to ridiculous noise, which makes the day very hard to get through. I’ll be happy to go home to get some sleep! Such a shame and I hope it’s just that I’ve been unlucky with my room and the rest are ok!"
The hotel is very clean the saff is very good nd location is very good nd staff is very professional nd pool garden is very grenery  nd food is very teasty nd clean  good for family nd coupl staff were very kind nd good 
I stayed 2 nights on business and it is a lovely hotel in a fantastic location.  The staff were all warm and friendly. The pool area is stunning and a peaceful oasis.  Beautiful views in a stunning colonial setting 
"If you are planning a short stay in Mumbai and are looking for a five star option, the Taj Mahal Palace is a great choice. We loved the attention to detail and the attentive staff from the pick up at the airport , the introduction to the hotel and the room, the restaurants and the valet. The hotel itself is loyal to its heritage and the decor is very well presented and maintained. The room was lovely. We had a club room on level 6 which had nice vaulted ceilings and great views across the city. Complimentary high tea and cocktails were included every day, which was a nice touch.  The staff were well presented and looked after us very well. Nothing was too much trouble.  The main reception area was a pretty hectic place and I got the impression some members of the public were"
"This is the place opposite the Arabian sea and gate way of India, super ambience and the staff just super and friendly, the lobbies and the shopping good , the restaurants too good and the rooms luxurious, the swimming pool , health club and other facilities excellent"
The hotel is very nice . Location is beautiful and very convenient  Garden is very clean?  The staff were very polite. Food is good   Lobby is charm  In breakfast so many things there which is so tasty and loveish  . I will highly recommend to this hotel.
"This hotel never fails to amaze me---it is not just the unique  architecture of the Palace wing---it is the top-class standards of service, attention to minute detail, going the extra mile to satisfy the guests, ---and all these--by almost every single person who is part of the hotel service---from driver to doorman to concierge, to room service, to restaurants, to---what have you!  the tariff is high, but fully justified if you wish to have the Taj experience! And of course, the food at any of the several restaurants, is so authentic and tasty!   Enjoy the traditional procession and lamp-lighting ceremony by the ladies in the hotel at around 5.30pm every evening!reat for a family holiday or for a business meeting!  I may sound  lofty, but none of this is exaggerated!"
"From the moment I arrived it was like walking into the days of the British Empire.  From the doormen who greeted me at the entrance to the enormous lobby and the glorious swimming pool area, it oozed old world charm.  My room overlooked the Gateway of India and it was a beautiful sight to wake to each morning.  Really generous size with a sitting area and lovely bathroom.  Great for shopping in Colaba with lots of restaurants, shops and sightseeing all within walking distance.  Love this place and can't wait to go back.  Leave plenty of time to get to the airport, it's a long way with a lot of traffic."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is indeed no less than a palace and the service immaculate as you would get in a royal Family Mahal.   Thank You Taj team for first all giving me a complimentary stay and then to add to this upgrading me to the Tower Room.   The room was spacious and all the interior seemed as if it was Spick and Span. The view from the room was of the Gateway of India.   They welcomed us traditionally during check-in.  The reception person even guided us to our room which not many hotels do.   I did not hear the word NO from the staff for anything I requested for and that was refreshing.     The food from the Golden Dragon restaurant is fabulous, though my favourite restaurant in this hotel is Wasabi.    My son whose almost 3 years old .. really enjoyed the pool which was"
"This is not the most convenient business hotel, it’s more geared to leisure, but it is a phenomenon.  The residents’ pool area is beautiful, there are a large number of good restaurants, and a convenient coffee shop.  Sundays are very busy especially in the winter season.  Highly recommended."
"taj mahal palace nice visit, i went for business visit,good serve,we can go with family and friends too,nice view point from hotel, i went few times with friends and its located near by gateway of india"
"We spent 3 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace recently and visited most of the bars and restaurants, which were all great with the exception of the Sea Lounge. We went for a drink after dinner at Wasabi (an excellent restaurant!) and were served by an older waiter, who didn't seem to listen or care. I asked for no ice in my whiskey and one cube of ice in a Baileys. He brought out my whiskey with ice and a glass full of ice for the Baileys and then he disappeared. We waited after we had finished our drinks hoping for another round or a room charge to sign. As neither happened we decided to go to the room and the waiter, who had been ignoring us, suddenly gave chase and said we HAD to wait for our check. I then explained to the ""manager"" that we weren't going to wait any longer and"
"It used to be one of our favorite hotels and we visited it many times, but now we were upset to see that in spite of the beautiful location and the great architecture, it has become too crowded and the service still efficient, but impersonal. The rooms are tired (some are being restored) and the breakfast room good but not perfectly clean.  It is worth though to stay in the Palace section to experience the view if you are for the first time in Mumbai. "
"It's always a majestic feeling staying at the TAJ Colaba Mumbai. Sheer luxury with excellent service, polite staff. The best dining in town for Indian, Chinese, Japanese and Mediterranean cuisine. The Sea lounge is one of the finest dining places to eat."
"Shamiana was a delight to be at, the waiters were very well aware of the menu. Just the location is a dull place , it would be better if we get any better view from the coffee shop.  I'll be there soon. "
"Amazing experience, beautiful hotel full of history , nice art on every corner , luxury. An island in the middle of busy Mumbai. Very professional staff. Originally in tower, we were changed to Palace side and asked to compare rooms what the staff did immediately. Tower rooms are more modern and business design with view but Palace side rooms are little gems (even if no view) . Food is good too but a bit pricey as it is a 5 star hotel but atmosphere of restaurants are worth the value."
"In October I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for one night, and I can only say I wish it was it for longer!   The room was perfect, really big, with a great view, super comfortable and the staff were really helpful!   The golden dragon (Chinese restaurant) was amazing! Everyone should go to try the duck!!!   Thank you to all! "
"warm hospitality , got surprise upgrade to palace wing . THe breakfast and dining experience is always special at Taj. The top floor restaurent offers breathtaking view , the buffet is expensive  though"
Had taken my associates from out of town to the Coffeeshop. They loved the experience. The ambience and the entire experience is lively. I go there most times when I have guests from abroad. They love the shopping there too. And it's one spot not to be missed by tourists.
Service is exemplary. I struggled hard to find fault ( succeeded : no bottle opener!) Otherwise pretty much spot on at every level - albeit at a price. But quality does not come cheap. Thoroughly recommended but stay in Palace wing for best experience if you can afford it.
Optimal location in the city. Excellent hotel with very good service. Well kept and reasonable pricing for a hotel of this level. Good option for business meetings as well as family stays with children. Good swimming polo. 
Winding up a month long visit to India.   Could not be more pleased with the iconic Taj in Mumbai.   Super warm welcome on arrival topped off with superb service.   Checking was done in our room.  Can’t beat the view of the sea from our room in the palace wing.   Great dining options. No real need to leave the property.   The service is over the top.  Fellow came to our room to give my wife a rose petal foot bath and we did not even order it.   WOW is all that comes to mind.   Taj properties have been nice this trip but this is the penultimate.   Well done staff and management. Well done. 
"Stayed here for 2 nights at the start of a mixed work/holiday spell in India. Stayed in the heritage wing with full hospitality package so expected and received exemplary care from all staff throughout. Enjoyed chilling by the pool, spa session and meal in the Indian restaurant as well as cocktails in the Harbour bar. Our only negative was that we found the both the atmosphere and tempertature in the Harbour Bar and the Indian restaurant, Masala Kraft, cold. The latter was relatively empty, had no windows and was at a glacial temperature. Staff and food were however great."
"After a long trip from south India ,to stay in this hotel on the front of Gate of India becomes  dream. Excellent services for all, tasty food, no quantities limits, they upgrade us ,because we use to stay in Taj Hotels, with a four room suite with dedicate buttler, and a lot of other small attentions. Congrats to this management"
"And enjoyable stay. The room was immaculately kept. We really enjoyed the luxuary of Ploh  Bath robes . The pool was a lovely temperature and the staff, including the changing room staff were very good.  We enjoyed the afternoon teas and evening drinks, made available to club members.    The cleaning and floor staff on fifth floor were excellent. They were very polite to customers, even standing aside to let customers pass, a very nice touch.   Breakfasts were excellent, there was a good range of different food types to suit all pallets.   The pastries and cakes were beautiful. The lady who greeted us in the morning remembered our room number (Madonna)  and was very warm and welcoming. Similarly, the gentleman who served us tea at the left hand side of the room (looking out of"
"The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai...From check in to check out ... it’s a totally different experience all together.  Great History & Great Culture. Every part & corner of this property is a master piece to enjoy & admire. It’s a Museum or an Art Gallery with a huge collection of Paintings, Old Photographs, Old Artifacts.  Unmatchable Hospitality & House keeping. Here everything works perfect.  Staying in Old Heritage wing ( club floor ) facing Arabian sea is an ultimate indulgence."
I was there for a conference over the weekend. Scenic view of the sea from my room. Great service. Knowledgable and welcoming front desk staff.. Truly vintage feel. Extravagant rooms and food was awesome!
"We decided to experience Taj hospitality at their flagship hotel - The Taj Mahal Palace and took a red eye flight to Mumbai. Hotel staff was very accommodating as they allowed us to check in early. We were also given an upgrade to the Palace wing which was the most beautiful part of the hotel.  The location of this iconic property is very impressive and the facilities are top notch. Staff is very helpful. Even though we stayed for a night, our room was freshened up at least 4 times which is not seen at any other hotel. Due to the upgrade, we had access to the lounge which is the most expensive room in the hotel due to presence of 2 gaitonde paintings and tastefully done flooring and panelling.  Health club and pool is top class and so is the pool deck area where evenings can be"
"The reviews for this hotel are amazingly positive. Is this collective admiration really deserved? A-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y.  There is no need to further discuss the absolute beauty of this hotel, inside and outside. The Taj Mahal Palace is certainly among the top 3 hotels we have visited in more than 50 countries around the world.   What really struck us during our 3-day stay is the customer service level. They could simply rely on their reputation and tourists would keep coming into the Taj no matter what.   Instead they will do amazing things to push your satisfaction to new levels: personalised check-in with hotel history, calling you by your family name at the restaurant on the second day (I just don’t know how they did it), remembering how you or your wife prefer certain meals,"
"This property is little old but maintained well. Their ambiance is authentic and classic so you can just feel their history and legend even you can enjoy staying for a while in their lobby. Staffs are well trained, friendly and proper distance. It was god experience to stay this hotel."
"We are lucky to have styed her befor a couple of years ago, but what can i say?! still perfection.  The Palacee wing is amazing and being welcomed with red roses by the wondrrful manager Ramneet Singh was very special :)   Cant wait to come back again!"
"This review is long overdue.   I think that I can safely say that the general rule at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is ""wherever possible say yes to the guest"". This has certainly been my experience in the stays at the hotel.   Excellent service is the norm but a few thoughts and a few notable mentions: In terms of front desk service, transportation arrangements, arranging cooking demos, Ms. Tiwari has been so pleasant and a huge help.   What can I say about our butlers, Adrian & Gaurav: so considerate and helpful. Sounds snobby, but they really did make our stay a joy.  Adrian with his smile and can-do attitude made sure we were properly attired for the day and in the evening would bring us chamomile tea before we retired for the evening.    At the Sea Lounge, if you need a table"
Starting from the greeting in the reception till the check out the services were very good. All the staff has smiling faces. Restaurant and choice of food was super. Keep up the good work team Vivanta Taj President Mumbai.
"Sorry, I've rarely had a positive experience here whether it is dining, chilling at the bar or staying in a suite. While the historical and architectural significance of this hotel and its buildings are impossible to overstate, I'm afraid it precisely these factors that make staying here unpleasant.   First, it never stops feeling like an Indian train station at rush hour. It is such a chore to get in and out of this hotel. The need for security is reasonable but surely there has to be a better way to go about it than the currently ridiculous entrance.   Service is cordial at best and just a total shitshow by the pool. A lot of the staff have been here for aeons and the complacency is more than evident. The suite we stayed in was huge and overlooking the Gateway. It is grand"
I have stayed here only once but it was a great experience. The quality of food is absolutely tremendous. The staff here is great and will make you feel special. This is no doubt the best luxury hotels in Mumbai.
To call this a mere hotel is a big mistake. We have stayed in other Taj hotels for business but nothing like this level of luxury and service at the Palace. We arrived at the Palace after a week of business then a 16 day holiday tour of northern India and were welcomed to the Palace and given a tour of the Palace. We noted a slight problem with our room on arrival but this was resolved while we went and had a cup of tea at the pool side. The response was excellent no quibbles and just resolved. We awoke to the boats bobbing in the Arabian bay outside our window and a fantastic view. We went down the incredible staircase for breakfast with views again to the Arabian  bay. As vegetarians we love Lebanese food were looking forward to dinner at the ultimate Middle Eastern experience
What a wonderful experience to spend 3 nights at this iconic hotel. Excellence in hospitality from start to end. I can highly recommend “Taj Mahal Palace” to everyone. we’re extremely impressed with the service and efectiveness. Especially in Diwali Taj Mahal Palace looks like a dream.
"My family and I stayed for 3 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace. Quite honestly, the stay surpassed all expectations we had. It was not our first stay there, but neverthless we chose the hotel based on its superb location rather than my previous experience.  I don’t know what’s changed during that time, but frankly we had an exceptional experience. We were upgraded from the Tower to the Palace wing. The staff were so welcoming, sincere and attentive we felt thoroughly pampered. The pool was exceptional. The house wine delicious, and there was so much to keep us and the toddler entertained.   The only downside was that we really didnt leave the hotel as much as I would have liked us to. Nevertheless, we had an unforgettable experience and I will not plan to stay anywhere else on"
Traditional welcome of Taj style by a pretty female with beautiful smiles at the entry was just a start of positive vibes and  friendly environment. (My apology I forgot her name) I personally feel the duty of welcome staff is really difficult for regular standing on gate and distinguishing resident guest from all entrants. On a suggestive note you may offer welcome services at the time when you are making guest comfortable for checkin while sitting in lobby. Please take this as my personal opinion as it may help in reducing the fatigue of welcome staff.  Had an excellent experience at front desk by well trained staff specially by Gaurav under perfect guidance of Taronish Karkaria. Chef Alisha Sequiera and Pratika Patil  made us motivated to have more food than average with
"There is  veneer of personalization at this place, but everything is impersonal from the greeting at the door to the checkout. When you check-in they asked us to take a seat and wait, while several hotel employees whizzed past looking busy. They finally came about to checking us in without any apologies about the delay. Several others were waiting as well. With so many employees scurrying around in the lobby you can't but wonder: what do they all do, if the service is so moderate (it's not poor, but it's not exceptional either). The day we were leaving, we were going to check out at 9 am and at 7 am our doorbell rang and it was the minibar guy who said he had to check the minibar before we left. I guess it's his job - but speaks poorly of hotel management. Will find another"
"I can highly recommend ""Taj Mahal Palace"" to everyone,  this was our first visit to The Taj Mahal Palace hotel & we were extremely impressed with the service & efectiveness, The staff are outstanding, We felt like VIP’s in this beautiful hotel & were sad to leave.  Thank you for a wonderful stay, Big Thank to all staff member for your attentiveness. You truly made our stay very special."
Love this place. It is so calm in the centre of bustle. Fabulous location and great views of the Gateway of India. The service is impeccable. So relaxing. The pool is the perfect temperature. Can't recommend the Taj Mahal Palace more highly.
Just a mind blowing 5 star hotel and is one of the best group of hotels of india where only staying reflects your well being status.it is even a must see tourist attraction of mumbai city where many to come to see
"This is the 5-Star Hotel, it is counted among the best hotels in India, where all types of facilities are provided to the tourists, and internet wi fi facility is also available, and there is also a swimming pool."
"An elegant historical hotel. Luxury is the keyword here. The rooms whether the old or new wing,as well as the public areas tastefully decorated. The breakfast spread sumptuous, simply spoiled for choice.Cleanliness seems to be their code. Bed linens crisp and white so divine"
"This is one of the great hotels of the world. And every single thing about it makes you realise why. The building itself is even more beautiful than you would expect. Our rooms in the old part of the hotel were spacious, luxurious and supremely comfortable. The staff are attentive, helpful and appear to know you by name as soon as you arrive, and the help we received (even a Taj rep meeting us at the airport for our transfer on) was quite extraordinary. There is a wide choice of places to eat - all we tried were excellent. We had a Taj driver and guide for a half day tour of Mumbai which could not have been better. Yes, its expensive. But for a reason!"
This hotel really has old word charm.   From the moment you get of the bus or out your car you will be in awe.    Security is tight.   You are greeted by friendly staff with a string of flowers for you neck and a drink.   While you book in your luggage is whisked off to your room.   The foyer has the most gorgeous huge flower arrangements.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed.    Staff at the elevators ensure that you go to the correct floor.    Breakfast at this institution can be eaten in the dining room or in the tea room on the first floor.   Nothing is too much for the staff in this hotel.  You just have to ask and your every whim will be looked after.    This hotel has a history.   Apparently the hotel was built facing the wrong side.   So The back is the front.   It
"My friend and I stayed at this hotel for the last few days of our trip around India. Beautiful hotel, lovely friendly staff and food was outstanding.  Here are some photos of the room, our view and inside the hotel. "
"I have spent the better half of the day trying to book a Club Level room at the Taj.  The website ccard link was down, I emailed the hotel, with photos of the rate and error I was getting, in hopes that they would call me and make the reservation directly.  No one callled or replied to my email.    I then called and was transferred to central reservations, and after booking the hotel, at the rate I wanted - I was advised as a guest at the hotel, I would have to attend a mandatory Christmas Gala dinner, and that he did not know the price.  I would have to call the hotel direct to confirm it. (He did try to reach them but the line was busy).     So I called the hotel - oh how I wish I had the young ladies name.  She was clearly not meant to be  in customer service.   She was not"
What a wonderful experience to spend 3 nights at this fabulous hotel.  The staff were immense and were so keen to attend to our every need. Nothing was too much trouble for them. This truly is a luxury hotel.  We had dinner in two of the restaurants and were impressed by the variety and quality of the dishes on offer. Would certainly recommend this hotel to any visitor to Mumbai.
The Taj Mahal Palace is the Gem of Mumbai City. The sea facing hotel is built amazingly and have beautiful rooms to stay in. The pool area is also beautiful with garden and seating area. The lobby has some great and luxurious shops and fine dinning restaurants.
"authentic place to have good food and some drinks, great place. sight seeing from the hotel was good and had a great time with friends. it was hard to reach the hotel due to heavy traffic outside the hotel"
"We were upgraded to a suite in the palace wing which was just fabulous. This hotel has the reputation as being one of their best and it certainly did not disappoint. The bed linen is of the finest quality making it one of the best sleeps you will ever have,very hard to get out of bed in the morning but the thought of their magnificent breakfast makes it easier.Afternoon tea reminds you of an era gone by,not at all uncomfortable like some five star hotels. The Pool is heaven after the madness of the Mumbai streets,if you ever visit Mumbai the Taj Palace hotel is a must,the staff and the ambience of this majestic hotel are unsurpassed!"
"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a 12 night stay in India. We were just so lucky to be upgraded to the Palace wing. This is such a lovely hotel with a great history. We loved doing the historical tour of the hotel, which takes place at 5.30pm every day, make sure to book onto this. We had a lovely meal in Masala Kraft during our stay. I really enjoyed having a swim in the lovely large outdoor pool at the end of a long day sight seeing The room was superb, so comfortable, I would definitely stay there again if we ever go back to Mumbai."
"This hotel is a dream!   My boyfriend and I, together with our friend stayed in this hotel during our 1 month round-India travel this fall. And we couldn't have imagined better wrapping up of our Indian trip.   This hotel will get you with its perfect location just opposite of India Gate, splendid historical architecture, wonderful welcoming and world class service.  Staying in this hotel you will feel like a part of Shererezada princess or Bollywood star.  Just walking aroung the historical part of halls feels like in the museum.  Room service on excellent level, with your private person available 24h, willing to fullfil any of your wish.  Due to long cue during the breakfast, we were offered a possibility to eat in our room, ordering food via room service.  Having a coffee,"
"I visited the Taj Mahal Palace hotel for 1 night with a sea view room overlooking the gateway of India, I only wish I had a more time to spend there, the staff was extremely helpful and made one feel very comfortable and at home, amazing rooms with wonderful views, scrumptious food, superb ambience. Truly an unforgettable experience.  A special mention to a member of staff, Deepika who was very helpful during my stay here."
"Absolutely wonderful two night stay in a here. Simply wonderful room which felt luxurious and decadent. The customer service is the best I've experienced anywhere. If I'm ever visiting again, I will book a room here. Highly recommended."
What a fantastic hotel steeped in so much history. On arrival we were delighted to be given an upgrade to the Palace rooms and we spent three unforgettable days in the wonderful luxury - one does not have to leave the hotel. We found the 5.30pm free hotel tour most interesting and the memorial to the 2008 terrorist attack is very moving. As we are  both in our mid to late seventies we may not have another chance to visit India again so we will always treasure our stay with you. Thank you so much.
"That was my first stay at Taj mahal palace and I was wondered over there with best take care by hotel. You check food which is extremely good, staff is perfect. They knew very well how to pemper guest."
We went to have a look around whilst staying in Mumbai and it was stunning.  It has great views from the restaurant and has a great selection of shops within the hotel including Rolex and Louis Vuitton (worth a look even if not buying).  It does feel majestic.
This hotel is on an amazing location. Sea view from the rooms is heaven. Evenings are beautiful if you are on the window of sea facing rooms. Of course this has a beautiful history (it was told to me by one localite) that this was constructed to let Britishers know that we Indian no less then any one. Stay here! It gave me a proud moment too
"It was 22 years since I lasted visited this hotel, back then I came just for a drink, this time I was lucky to stay.   We had a room overlooking the gateway of India, which was an incredible site to see, it changed from dusk to dawn.  The inside reminded my slightly of the opulent hotels of Dubai, big lobby, designer shops mingled with restaurants and bars. The outside pool area near the outside restaurant was very pretty, we had lunch and a cocktail there.  We didn't get chance to have dinner in the hotel as we wanted to try a restaurant nearby instead, however we did eat breakfast, which was plentiful and varied, so much choice.  We felt very safe there, airport scanners were used for everyone entering the hotel.  This was the last leg of out tour before returning home, we"
"Very excellent place I loved it Very memorable place,  This is my second time, I need to come again again here love this place, this i came with my friends we enjoyed very lot and we stayed here 2 days very very lovely days."
"Well, I guess no words can describe the beauty of this place. Specifically, its architecture. However, I was not able to enjoy it as it was overcrowded and people were pushing each other. Hence, it was difficult to enjoy the experience.   Nonetheless, a beautiful sight. "
"To call this a hotel is doing it a disservice. There is no way this is a mere hotel. This is truly a Palace, it's majestic outside and it's just as majestic inside. My wife's eyes and mine, were like saucepan lids from the moment we unfurled our legs and arms and heads from the confines of our black Premier Padmini taxi (mini being the operative word) with our two suitcases roped together precariously on its small yellow roof.   Open-mouthed, we took in the amazing architecture, the flotilla of fishing boats bobbing up and down in the Arabian Sea under the ever watchful gaze of the Gateway of India and the sea walls crammed with people to watch the sunset.   We entered, our heads swivelling at well everything really, and then finding ourselves in front of M.F.Husain's stunning"
"Stayed in April 2017, there's no doubt that the location in itself is quite legendary, I had a room in the palace instead of the tower and had a view of the pool on the backside. This hotel is legendary inside out, The room on itself was quite beautiful, the bathroom is white marble and the washbasin mirror has a TV on it, my room had a nice white decor. During my stay on day 1 there was an art expo or going on,luckily I got to witness the artwork of India's finest on that day.  They give hotel tours to it's resident guests in which hotel staff will show you things around with the history attached to it, you'd be surprised how an innocuous looking chandelier can be made from the metal of Eiffel Tower that the founder himself procured.  They have an evening tea ritual, which is"
"I’ve started and stopped writing this review a few times, deleting and rewriting the first sentence over and over. The problem is everything has already been written about the Taj Mahal. It’s history, it’s service, the detail. If you know about the Taj, it is all true. If you don’t know about the Taj, get ready for an experience you will never forget.  I stayed in the Palace - it’s the Taj, you have to stay in the historic part. Marble everywhere. Woodwork they just don’t do today. I could go on and on. Just look at the pictures.  The lounge is like stepping back in time. Great cocktails and impeccable service. I may have gone to the lounge 3, ok 4 times in less than 24 hours. Fruit juices, tea time, after dinner drinks. It’s just perfect.  The breakfast buffet, best I’ve found"
"It was a short trip for a special occasion and we are so happy we chose Taj. There was a slight hiccup at the start but the hotel staff- Atul Chauhan and his team (Ganesh, Swapnil, Anant and Nirmala) were simply awesome- Rose petals foot spa, Sandal face pack, Flowers and cake- Thanks guys for making us feel so special on our anniversary...a special mention to Vinod who did room service for dinner and helped us with the right food suiting our taste...Absolutely enjoyed the stay..."
"This hotel is a compulsory visit in Mumbay that you cannot lost due to its emblematic contribution to the history. It is really near to the Indian door with fantastic views to the Arabic sea. I visited only its restaurant but service was more than good and as it was my birthday, restaurant, with ""some local help"", surprised me with a birth cake!!! clapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_handsclapping_hands"
"Absolutely fantastic! There was truly nothing we could fault. We actually stayed there twice, both at the beginning and the end of our holiday. Firstly in the Palace and secondly in the Tower. Both rooms definitely deserve their 5* rating. The location, right next to the Gateway to India ensured a fantastic view over it. The service from the staff was exquisite and the fine dining in Souk was like heaven on earth. We would definitely recommend this as one you won't forget!"
"We booked this hotel based on many good reviews and some which were exaggerated especially about service and knowing that celebrities and world leaders/politicians have also stayed there.   The room we booked was in the heritage wing of the hotel, and the experience at check in was awful. At first the receptionist said that she couldn’t find our reservation and that i had to contact my agent who booked it for me, and because he’s in another country “obviously” i asked for access to the internet and she refused, telling me that its only for hotel guests!! This was absolutely unacceptable. I asked for her manager, thinking i might get some sympathy in having access, and to my surprise she was the front desk manager, I laughed at first and was really speechless, thinking how on"
one of the best stay one can have . the rooms staff every one deserve and get a perfect 10  . staying in the palace wing is like staying in a palace and you are treated like a royalty  the restaurants are excellent and every one seems to be there just to look after you .  they can make food catering for your tastes .being vegetarian the chef would come himself and suggest what we should have.
"Popularly known as Taj hotel or Taj Mahal hotel, Comes under Heritage Grand class. Never stayed there (I am not counting breakfast and tea in their cafe) but been this place numerous times. Prices are very expensive in Indian standard. Always fascinated by this amazing red building. History is quite interesting behind this hotel. It is said that Jamshedji Tata decided to build the hotel after he was refused entry to one of the city's grand hotels of the time, Watson's Hotel, as it was restricted to ""whites only"".   Arabian Sea view- the gateway of India and old Bombay roads, view from this hotel is amazing. The place is one of the must-see places in today's Mumbai.  The hotel has hosted many notable guests, from presidents to captains of industry and stars of show business. A"
"stayed 2 nights for business. inside the palace wing feels like a haven away from crazy city. facilities look old. service mediocre. too many limitations. any request that deviates from standard is not possible, whereas in a hotel like this the extraordinary should be possible. big miscommunication as rgards a second reservation. let's se how that will be handled. "
"Stayed there for a day on a personal visit. But the minute we stepped in we were welcomed with haarathi and Sindoor .we asked for sea facing room and the view from the room is so beautiful, you can just spend hours watching gateway of india and the boats stationed there.Breakfast has lots of varieties to suit every palate. It's better to have food in the restaurants than ordering room service which is 40% costlier. Overall it's a memorable experience."
"It has always been a pleasure to stay in this charming old world hotel. We recently had a wonderful stay for four nights in the second fortnight of July.   Situated at Apollo Bunder, right along the Arabian Sea, Taj Mahal Palace becomes all the more charming during the monsoon.   The Gateway of India, its younger but historic neighbour, adds to the great legacy of the hotel. And the promenade too has many a historic buildings adding to the charm of the location.  On arrival we were welcomed in traditional Indian style with vermillion being put on our foreheads and a basil garland around our necks. A soft jasmine fragrance was wafting in the very elegant lobby.   We were ushered to our room in the Tower Wing of the hotel and to our lovely surprise we had been upgraded to a"
I went for a short stay at Taj Mahal Hotel Mumbai. It is a grand property and has high security due to past incident. Hotel is lovely from inside. Stayed in the Palace category. They also have Tower category of rooms. Not sure about the difference and people may like to check on the web. The Palace side rooms were good.. Spacious and actually very spacious from Mumbai standards. Bathroom was large and had bath tube as well as shower cubicle. Service was excellent and in line with Taj Standard.  The room had sufficient lighting and nice working table. TV had limited channels but can be ignored esp if person is on official visit..  Used the gym as well. Nice and well equipped.. Just that few of the equipment look little old.. Having said that it is quiet a large gym.  breakfast
Great hotel.lovely location.fantastic service. So go ahead and book it you will enjoy your stay. The rooftop restaurant  the souk has great views of the gateway of india and the ocean. Lovely shopping and museaums are walking distance.
"I was a little sceptical of how this holiday was going to pan out when I booked, only because having seen documentaries about the place I was not entirely convinced that snippets of a TV documentary portraying such courteous attentive staff could really be a true reflection of this place.   Much like I suppose 90s Bollywood's portrayal of the wonderful elements of growing up the ""simplicity"" of filmy romance, but in reality life is so much more complexed!    Safe to say I was wrong! The TV did no justice to the Taj, the place is breathtakingly beautiful, the staff are absolutely amazing. I saw them deal with some pretty tedious people when I was there but every time they kept smiling and the level of dedication the staff have for their jobs is phenomenal.   Right from the moment"
"I have stayed at this lovely hotel many times, and this time I flew in for my birthday and they made the most wonderful effort for me.  It was very special.  I think the more often you stay at a place the more you come to know it, and there are a few shortfalls that would take very little to resolve.  I was staying at the hotel for 7 nights in which there was a holiday weekend, and the hotel became exceedingly crowded - more so than I have seen on any of my previous stays.  We had to queue for breakfast each morning during this weekend, and when we did get into the Sea Lounge, tables were inadequately prepared, and the buffet was poorly stocked.  I think I had to ask 3 times for coffee.....no napkins, and inadequate cutlery.  No croissants left on the buffet, or yogurt, which"
"The hotel is lovely and the staff is friendly and generally happy to assist.  India takes some getting used to.  In America we are used to things moving quickly and service people responding when a request is made.  That is not always the case in India.   Even in this luxurious hotel, in the Apollo coffee shop we found we had to ask 3 times for someone to take our order and when the air conditioner started to drip on our table and our food, we practically had to scream to get a new table.  The Apollo restaurant is the worst part of this majestic hotel.  Perhaps just don’t eat here.  "
Didn't stay here this trip but visited for lunch Staff were informative as well as welcoming Food and ambience in the restaurant were first class Had a wander around looking at the beautiful furnishings and designer stores Don't miss the wooden carving that came from the check in desk of I think Air India Beautiful hotel
"We have a free stay since my husband is an inner circle member . Despite that they were so good to give us the room ,,,,no not room a suite in the palace building of the Taj  which has huge rooms  ( though they have all amenities still the old world charm seems untouched) and the bath itself must have been around 300 sq ft, The decor of the room though so simple but the old world touch all over makes it so cozy and elegant.  But above all the service we received takes over probably 99% of all that we have experienced till date in our travel history at hotels and restaurants. The view of the gate way of India is amazing as well. We ordered room service since we had a dining room and a living room  as well,, so wanted to make the most of it. We ordered Indian Spinach with ricotta"
"From the moment I checked in till I checked out 5 days after it was only the best service.  Historic tour of the hotel is a must and is really cool concept. Pool side and all the lounges are decorated amazingly. Butler service is really nice but not needed since mindful gifts and treats are left all around the place (if you are staying in Palace wing of course). The staff is so knowledgeable and friendly, but not pushy. Always at your service with the biggest smile on their face. This is a must experience wise when in Mumbai. I am coming back for sure. THE TOP"
"You simply can't put it in words! The Taj Palace is a timeless classic that serves to tell tales of indian courage and grandeur.  Impeccable service, shimmering chandeliers and ornate art adorn the taj corridors as you walk across the famed halls."
"For every Indian who believes or has interest in Luxury Hotels, I am sure for majority numero uno is Taj Hotels, especially Taj Mahal Palace and Towers, Mumbai. The first Hotel property in Bombay then to have electricty supply. It ofers the best view over looking the Gateway of India.  After a 10 ten year gap, I finaly booked for an overnight stay at Taj Mahal Tower only to find on checking-in that I have been upgraded to Taj Palace. For few seconds I couldn't believe what I heard.  On enetering the room, I was stunned to see the beautifully architected room and the passageway leading to it.  Quick grab at shamiana, Nice lunch at Golden Dragon, follwed by hair cut and facial at their Amazing Salon & Spa, awesome starters and mocktails at Aquarius a pool side restaurant only for"
"Ambience is good. But staff are always apologetic of state of affairs. The staff try to show the guests that they are doing them a favour of providing service. I would say the guests are doing a favour of coming there. Oberoi and ITC offer much much better luxury and the staff don't say it's a favour, they treat every guest with importance and their standard of luxury is much higher when compared. If you complain they will give you a gift and apologise but they will not improve upon their offerings. A Sorry state of affairs. Taj Unique selling point ""We offer crap luxury and then we apologise"". ITC never apologises, because they dont need to, everything is just provided. Don't waste money on your stay. Although restaurant recipies are good, but the culture still persists there"
If you travel to Bombay don't miss this haven hotel.and take the palace club room or the suit. It is a parfect staying! You will enjoy the most incredible services and fill like a maharaja..... You can enjoy the club benefits almost all day... The Chinese restaurant is parfect and most delicious. Also the pool is very nice. Don't miss that amazing Taj . Arnon
"I spent six nights in the Taj during my recent tour of India. From the moment I checked in to the moment I left, I received only the very best service from polite, friendly and knowledgeable staff who did their best to ensure my stay was memorable. This included  suggestions of places I might like to visit in the city after discussing my photography with staff in the hotel's Masala Kraft restaurant and prompt responses to my request from the housekeeping team where Jayesh was particularly helpful. The concierge team was also able to help me with good recommendations for vegetarian restaurants close to the hotel. I would also like to note my thanks to Beauty in the cafe.  My room was extremely comfortable and had a great view of the Arabian Sea and the Gateway of India. I look"
"Visited here for a friends birthday for 2 nights, the service is excellent from checkin to check out.  The choice of restaurants is amazing, buffet breakfast was included so cant go wrong there. The staff are friendly and helpful."
the taj takes one back to a bygone era of opulence and royalty with service to match. staff go out of their way to meet your every whim. good shopping to be done outside the hotel too. would definitely visit the taj again.
Defintely worth a visit and make sure you get a good guide so that they could show and explain the history and landmarks properly or else you will be wandering the palace and waste a day. Remember fridays is holiday. Pick a weekday to visit.
" I've often visited Mumbai and looked at the Taj hoping I could stay there one day.  Well we just spent a few days for our honeymoon there and were both totally amazed at the quality of it and the staff.  They are so welcoming and thoughtful we couldn't have wished for a better stay. The breakfast covered everything and the service was spot on. The special efforts made by the staff made it an unforgettable occasion, one that we hope to repeat every anniversary. Afternoon tea in the lounge was nice and relaxing. Sad to leave but will be back to be pampered in such luxurious surroundings again. Keep up the superb work! "
"This Hotel was one of the best Hotels I have stayed in.The service from the friendly staff was exceptional and the location was also very good, close to Museum, Art Gallery The Gateway to India, Markets though small at that end of Town), Some other great shops not to mention Starbucks. There is also some great restaurants close by."
"Sensational food, service, surroundings. Cannot be faulted. Yes it is very expensive but it was really worth it, a truly iconic place to eat. Security was ultra tight, more so than any other hotel. Splash the cash."
"The hotel is very beautiful, excellent food and facilities; but what really makes the difference is people! they are always trying to make you happy. This is my first experience in India and was really impressed by this hotel"
"Wonderfull place,nice to visit this place with such a great experience.Nice facilities nd very co-operative staff's.There are many small shop inside the hotel and the book store is very nice and had a huge collection of books.."
The fantastic staff at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel ensured we has a wonderful stay in the last week of September. A special than you to Anant and Sophia at the Shamiana restaurant who made it a magical time for our 21 month old daughter. Great food and staff made fie a relaxing break we will be back.
"My Husband and I stayed three nights at the The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel for our 30th  Anniversary and we would both like to thank Vaibhav Sangle, Taronish Karkarla & Rakes Vaish for making our stay a most memorable one from the moment we arrived they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  We were given an up grade on our room to the place wing the gave us a anniversary cake, alcohol free champagne and decorated our rooms heart with balloons it really was the most wonderful welcome I have never encountered such service from the all the staff at The Taj Mahal Palace  from Reception, bar staff restaurant staff and bell staff everyone has a professional approach and are extremely helpful.

One of the best experiences of my hotel stay .. It was a pampering experience in all areas .. All the staff was brilliant in their job and made stay memorable .. Loved the location and interiors of Taj ...

"Excellent service. Client centricity throughout your stay. Food Varieties available including Indian, Chinese, Japanese and Lebanese. Excellent Conference room facilities. Recreational facilities in Gym, swimming pool and JiVa spa are available. Choose the Palace wing for accommodation whenever you can"
"Stayed for 4 nights at  the palace wing. Hi quality elegant rooms with a great finish. Staff is superb. One of the front office mangers Saswata Banerji went out of his way and checked on me every day, and was extremely attentive up to the smallest details.  Great staff , breakfast and sea view at the Sea Lounge. "
"Excellent, service orientated with ever friendly and willing staff.  We were pleasantly surprised on the occasion of my Mother's birthday, with her room being given that additional treatment like flower petals placed in a beautiful pattern to the many balloons nestled on the bed and chairs and the cherry on the top a beautifully decadent chocolate cake which was so big that our travelling party of seven all got a share of."
"Hotel was everything you have heard of and more, customer service excellent. Staff polite and friendly, facilities fantastic. I was travelling solo and I never felt alone there. Waiters chatted to me, all staff spoke when you saw them. You were made to feel important. "
"First time to be in this hotel for business trip. Stayed one night only. Wish i can stay longer. Been to top 5-star hotels all over the world and I must say this property stands out notably in the exceptional level of services provided. So consistent was high level of service offered by all the staffs including waiters from 4 different restos i dined in -Sea Lounge, Wasabi, Red Dragon and Masala. Amazing! Check in and out is easy and no hassle. keep up with the great job! Will certainly be back!"
"our stay in Hotel Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai was a great experience. watching sea from the room window was fascinating. Location, decor, interior, amenities, services, everything is a class in itself.......Its a paisa vaool experience...."
"Outstanding hotel experience .. begins from the warm welcome.. in the magnificent lobby .. which is redolent of the palaces of antiquity., winding through opulent corridors and regal decor the room in the palace is a remarkable haven of luxury and tasteful furnishing. Top class service and gourmet food ! "
"What strikes is the grooming of the staff. Old world courtesy. Even in the best of establishments, the service does not measure up. Here it was exceptional. Food was very good and served with personalised care. Great amenities. Great location."
"I have enjoyed my stay at this hotel, this hotel has very Excellent service, the hotel arrange for car with driver to take me all over the places can wait for me the whole day till he bring me back to hotel safely "
"Amazing hotel, Highly recommend. The staff were amazing, The hotel is so beautiful, food was amazing and great variety. The welcome and treatment from staff was so warm we could not of asked for more. We look forward to another stay in the Taj palace."
Our stay at the Taj in Colaba was amazing. They will go out of their way to pamper you and will leave no stone unturned. It was definitely the best experience at any hotel we have ever had. Will definitely be back!!! Taj has set extremely high standards overall. Thank you making this the best trip to Mumbai ever!
I really enjoyed my stay.. the stuff nice and helpful.. they have different room sizes but all of if clean and will organized .. they have 24 hours room room service and you can order food too .. the food is good .. there are many rest areas close and open around the swimming pool.. they super care and make me feel like am in home 
"This is my first stay at a Taj property. It was highly recommended to me by a colleague, i was told to make sure that I stay in the palace wing as it is a good mix of Indian hospitality along with a  regal experience of staying in a place.  I have to admit, the hotel exceeded my expectations in all aspects. I stayed in the sea facing club room at the place. The room was beautiful with antique furniture, it portrayed a perfect balance of modern day living with an ancient touch of class. A special thanks to Devia who was there at the entrance to greet us. She took us straight to the room , it was my first time when i didn't have to check in at the desk, devia sent our passports to the desk while she escorted us to the room. she was very polite and extremely helpful. She made the"
Always enjoyed my stay at Taj Palace.Its a great hotel with exceptional service and wonderful staff.

"We stayed here before joining a Great Rail Journeys Tour of India (Kerla on the Konkan Railway).  The Hotel is steeped in history - over the years, the great and the good have all stayed here.  Tip: (1) The security is excellent.  The lift the bonnet on each vehicle as it is entered, check the boot and check underneath the vehicle with mirrors.  Photography of arriving vehicles is not permitted.  (2) The greatest asset of the Hotel is its staff - the customer service is superb.  (3) The outdoor swimming pool is protected by overhead mesh which keeps the leaves and birds out. (4) If possible, try to get a table in the Sea Lounge at breakfast - the view is lovely. (5) Go on a tour of the Hotel - it is a fascinating history. (6) Anosh in the Sea Lounge is a true credit to the Hotel"
"I've enjoyed my stay in this amazing hotel and was extremely satisfied with each and every service provided to us. The ppl are extremely polite and providing high quality service level. The breakfast is really nice.. I love the arrangements done by the hotel for our room since our anniversary was near. The location of the hotel is awesome in the heart of Colaba and opposite Indian Gate. As Arab we go to buy Oud, so only walking distance to Abdulrasheed and Ajmal. Also Starbucks is located at the back of the hotel. Extremely secured... "
"I cannot thank the staff enough for their welcoming and attentive nature.  I brought my girlfriend for her first trip to India and not only was the property impeccable the staff exceeded everyone's expectations.  From the warm welcome and roses to the departure gift she could not and cannot stop reliving the stay.  Thank you all again for the wonderful memories.  J. Todd Alabama, USA"
This is an exceptionally beautiful hotel.  The service is excellent - very prompt and an extraordinarily friendly and helpful staff.  I would certainly make a point of staying there again if I travel to India.
"A superbly maintained grand ole hotel with excellent service and prime location.  A real treat and privilege to stay at such a fine establishment. If its good enough for kings, queens and movie stars its good enough for me :-)"
"Although I am a localite, I never had the chance to visit the Taj Mahal Palace until and unless, a wedding took place here. I got the chance to share the room with my cousins which was sea-facing. The room service and the room-view, both were amazing and made the stay experience so much worthy! I really look forth to come back and stay here once again!   Also, please do stay in the Old Wing! :)"
"Rooms have a certain old world charm, large bathtubs from a more spacious time, breakfast table next to a window overlooking the Arabian sea, if you crane your neck a bit, you can see the Gateway of India too... A perfectly authentic Aloo Parantha.  A historic bar  A letter signed by Amstrong, Aldrin and Collins... Hmm, need I say more?"
"Stayed at the Taj Palace for a few nights and could not wish for better. It was my first time to India and did not know what to expect. I was greeted at the Airport by a friendly professional driver with white gloves, a great start! After an hour or so we arrived at the magnificent Taj Palace and I was quickly escorted to my room in the old wing ( you must stay in the old wing) with spacious comfortable rooms with stunning marble bathrooms. Breakfast in the seaside lounge is a real treat. Service was impeccable and nothing is too much trouble. I loved the fine bone China, silver cutlery and high quality linen. It's here that I realized I will love India. Venturing out is a challenge, lots of people and some are quite determined to sell something to you. The secret is not to make"
 I always try to stay here .The service can not be beat . I was upgraded to the palace .i had access to a butler for anything I needed .If you stay here take the tour of the hotel very interesting . The hotel is beautiful and so much history. Each time I stay here they get me with something truly different.this time it was a foot bath .
"Taj (CROWN) Mahal Palace Mumbai Living As Per Its Name As CROWN of Hospitality Industry For Showcasing The Best Hospitality To The Guest In India Reason Being The Only Hotel Group Which Correctly Follows The Indian Standards of ""Athiti Devo Bhavo"" & They Even Display The Indian Culture Through The Uniform of All Male & Female Staff.  I Happened To Visit This Heritage Property On September 10, 2017 For A Gala Dinner of The “10th UICH Asian Congress” Which Had Delegates From Across The Globe, From Welcome To Closing Everything Was Beyond Imagination.  The Moment I Entered The Ballroom I Was Offered A Welcome Drink Which I Denied And Walked In Quickly, As It Was Our First International Event In India Hence Most of Us Were Curious To See The Set Up For Our Most Awaited Gala Night"
"Beautiful building, beautiful victorian architecture, good location. One of the oldest hotels in Mumbai. Excellent pool area, large, peacefull & beautiful. Bar prices high, but understanable, Beautiful rooms, good service."
"this was my first visit to india. on the recommendation of a friend, I booked the Taj Palace. I am very pleased that i did. I arrived at 2 am, was jetlagged and tired but the excellent reception at the aiport and the hotel and its amenities made up for travel fatigue. "
The hotel is stunning and the location is great especially for business travelers. However the area as well as the hotel are both very crowded. So if you are looking for a not so busy travel then this might not be a great selection. I was not impressed by the quality of breakfast either - again the coffee shop is super busy and noisy. The staff ofcourse is very helpful and hospitable.
"Staying in a living history is really wonderful but will ever remember the hospitality of all the nice people we came across.  Specially need to mention, Ms.Nikita from chocolate shop.  Also Mr.Sebastin who took my request over phone for booking.  Mr.Neha and Mr Glen,also the lady assigned for taking  photographs at lobby; their assistance helped my trip memorable and who made the difference. My apology as I can not recollect her name."
What a place - booked early we stayed in the west wing - own butler and full marble rooms!  In the lobby mix with the famous - don't forget to check out the signed photos of who has shared this amazing hotel with you before! - I'm not going to spoil any surprises!   Step outside into the hustle and bustle of this vibrant city - back in your room the peach & quite will be fully respected!
Our visit at the Taj was very pleasant. I was here for a 3days conference and the time spent was exemplary! I would want to name Satish Gaikwad  & Sandeep from  Concierge were very prompt and excellent at their service provided to me! Overall an excellently executed event with Tajness reflecting in all aspects. Highly recommended hotel !! Must visit hotel in Mumbai.
"The Taj has been Excellent in all the respects, particularly, hospitality, quality of service, soft and touching approach, customer care, professionalism and so on. Every section and area of operations is outstanding. It's much more than""Value for Money"""
"I stayed for one night alone.On first sight,it is just amazing with very beautiful facade and noble furnished.Staffs are very kind.I had a problem with electricity but after I called they fixed it very quickly.I booked a sea-view room, the view was also amazing.It was an excellent experience staying in this hotel. But if they can improve their WIFI,it would be better.You have to re-login once your mobile auto screen-locked."
"This hotel can make you feel like Maharaja of a Palace, starts with warm welcome in traditional style, followed by courteous room allotment, nice  luggage handling, extremely polite service from the staff. The whole experience is mesmerising. The breakfast was one of the best. I think The beauty of Taj mahal palace is understood when you have stayed at various domestic and international five star hotels. It can speak volumes"
"This was the perfect last experience of India. Everything about the hotel feels like grace and grandness. Take a chauffeured trip around the city and enjoy the city in style. I only wish I had more time to enjoy more of the Taj Mahal Palace, it's not just a place to stay but a part of Mumbai everyone should experience "
It is beautyfull hotel just near the arabian sea.I am lucky to be there last year in business meeting.actually no word can be found for describing this Royal hotel.its iconic beauty spereds all over the mumbai for its dashing decoration.original paintngs all over the hotel is amezed me lot.
This hotel is huge at a place like Mumbai which is very hard to established.  The hotel completes their more than 50 years of it's opening.  A classic hotel consist of any type of food supplements of many countries. 
"the best hotel i have ever been to from every single aspect.  service was one of a kind. all the hotel workers are very welcoming and helpful. great breakfast and the hotel's restaurants are special and good: we went to two of them, masala kraft and souk and both were great."
one of the best when it comes to hotel stays  safe secure and comfortable  you feel welcomed the moment you step into the lobby and its a very comforting experience from the luxurious decor to the smiling and always welcoming staff exceptionally clean rooms and amazing service. by the time you leave you know you are gonna be back for future stays
"Whether on a business visit or a tourist, a stay in the heritage wing of Taj Mahal hotel is an experience by itself. Palace ambience, noise free environment and extremely effilent service make you remember and reminisce your stay long after. Just five floors with majestic carpeted staircase ( lift also available) with an excellent view of the historic Gateway of India ( rain lashing the monument in monsoon days) from most rooms is to be enjoyed than told. Classy restaurants and coffee shop serving gourmet cuisine to suit every taste. This has been one of my best stays in Mumbai , the city which  I travel to frequently on business and stayed in many hotels."
"Want to know how it feels to be a royal?  Book a few nights at this iconic hotel.   From the minute we checked in until the minute we left, the service at the Taj was unsurpassed.  Each and every employee works hard to please and impress you.  They look for opportunities to surprise and thrill you.   Housekeeping tidies up throughout the day, leaving you microfiber squares to clean your eyeglasses, velcro closures for your electronics cords, and flowers to delight you.  Our room was a Taj Club room in the old section, and included afternoon tea, evening cocktails, post-dinner cognac & chocolate in the Palace Lounge, where employees treated us like regulars. Honestly, we didn't want to leave."
"Easily the most iconic property in Mumbai, we had a chance to stay in the 1903 build 'Palace Wing' (the 'Tower Wing' is the newer one). It is a tasteful fusion of old and new and is like any luxury property, but with a heritage. While it has been known for it exemplary service, the hotel service appears to have gone down a bit. Nevertheless, one of the finest in the city."
"Great house keeping and attention, good food and nice staff. Pool area was lovely but a little noisy from street. Very clean and attention to detail, felt important as a guest. Loved the idea that the Hotel supported a group of young students that took guests on a safe trip to the Mumbai slum areas rather than a tour company, we appreciated the guides effort from "" Meet the Locals"" "
One must stay in this heritage hotel. From your entry into hotel till check out from hotel they will treat you like king. Palace wing rooms are extremely beautiful. Staff are very humble and attentive for customers. Excellent location of property
"A fantastic location. On the inside , the hotel is massive. You can get lost instantly. Also great for banquets. The golden room is one such great banquet hall . Food is also above average. Bang opposite gateway of India"
Iconic heritage symbol of love!red_heartBeyond words it's one of the seven wonders of the world!! Go early to avoid the lines.. Also go with a tour guide.They don't let you take your phone or purses inside.. and you have to cover your shoes .
"If you love art , the Taj Palace is the place to stay . If you love classical furniture and artefacts , the Taj Palace is the place to be . If you love sweeping staircases and old-world charm, the Taj Palace has to be the place to stay ."
"This hotel was Luxury Classic property. Nice hotel, good quality service. Value for money. Close to Gate of India.   Lobby was quite big, clean and look luxury. I am enjoyed stay in this hotel. Thank for everything"
"i got chance to attend a meeting in september , during my visit i needing some assistance about my trip ahead , concierge Satish and his team help me a lot , they are really very helpful and knowledgeable , thank you F&B staff for nice arrangement , hotel is very close to Gateway of India  , doorman's and security team helpful , one more thank you to all ,"
There is historical value at this hotel and should visit the hotel. Restaurants are quite interesting and the food is superb. some of the restaurants charge even you to seat in the restaurant. Price is quite high.
The Taj Palace  is really the one of the most  wonderful hotels we have stayed at . It pampers you to the hilt . I would recommend the Taj club rooms on the 6 th floor of the palace wing . It is really value for your money and a memorable  experience .
Stay would be more comfortable and also good for the restaurant s if we get a brief of all cuisine and also SOUK . I look forward to stay at any holiday destination only at Taj group . Pease send me where can i send few photographs that i had clicked during the stay .
Luxury at its best . Felt like a king for a day But amazing property with Amazing History Would definitely like to bring my family one day to this royalish property. Felt Like The Best in Mumbai  Concierge Satish Gaikwad and his team were brilliant in their Arrangement.
"one of the best hotels I stayed, excellent hospitality by professionals. one of the best hotel that I stayed. great service by professional hoteliers. hope to see you all soon. the entire hotel every corner is a story to inspire guest. that's great. Hotel orientation was great."
"Attended the 10th UICH Asian Congress which was held in their Crystal room and the arrangement was amazing.  The entire event arrangements were excellent right from welcoming of the guests and the presentations  Was very much impressed with the lavish  variety of food in the buffet layout with the food being very very tasty.  Kudos goes to the Concierge team headed by Satish Gaekwad, Sandeep, Jagtap, Dinesh & Saptrishi for the excellent arrangements and great welcoming."
"This is one of the best, if not the best, hotels I have ever stayed in.  The reason for that comment revolves around the staff at this hotel, I have never come across such a professional team.  From reception, waiters, porters, cleaners, concierge they all were fantastic and made our visit perfect. I took the card of Harshvardhan Sunderka so I could mention him in my review.  He went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay.   Our room was amazing and the restaurant food was top notch as you would expect.  This is the perfect hotel for a stay for business or pleasure and I would come back to Mumbai just to stay in this hotel for a few more days.  A truly luxury hotel that feels so comfortable you don't want to leave."
Although it was a quick 2 night trip into Mumbai it was indeed the best decision i made to stay here from check in the super friendly staff even escourted me to my room. I tried my luck and requested an upgrade on my room was given a huge room with the most perfect decor bathroom was stunning. Breakfast was out of this world. The location cant get any better. Look its not cheap but its deffinately worth every penny. Well done keep it up
"If you want to be pampered in luxury and opulence and also to be surrounded by happy and smiling faces ,do manage a stay in the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. It is an iconic structure with a rich heritage but beautifully amalgamated with the modern facilities. The lobby is huge and the traditional Indian welcome is done there by smartly dressed hostess. The reception counter wall is a piece of art where you are politely checked in and a refreshing welcome drink is offered. Each wall and structure has a story to tell and you should be willing to soak in . The rooms are luxuriously and thoughtfully furnished-- there is nothing garish . The heritage walk is a conducted tour of the hotel which is a must as it  is an eye opener. Each corner has a piece of art beside the "" art gallery "" in"
"Too many things to mention;  Immaculately run, Excellent customer service, All staff kind and friendly and greet you with a smile. Free upgrade. superb Breakfast and High tea. Beautiful rooms. Freedom to explore every nook and cranny within reason of this Grand Palace. Majestic premises that are maintained to the highest standards.  Endless free gifts for the Children. An Iconic Hotel/Palace steeped in history. Swimming pool set in beautiful grounds. My son loved exploring this vast palace From its grand staircases to its vast array of boutiques and shops, to its beautiful floral arrangements. Every member of our family truly enjoyed every second of our stay. For us the list is endless for the positives for the Taj Mahal Palace. From the moment you walk in you are made to feel"
Its got the best room service..!! All type of food is available..as per ur comfortability...location is also awesome near sea...cool breeze....little noisy but awesome..!! Staff is also very helpful..!! 
"I've stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world including recently in Japan. However, my experience at the Taj Palace , Mumbai is always something totally different . If you wish to know the true meaning of Indian Hospitality, then this is the place to stay . From the moment you walk In till you check out , you are treated like a royal . The staff is so friendly at all levels and it's just amazing how important they make you feel 24x7 ! This hotel is truly a class apart from any rating . The taste in the pudding is in the eating so don't even think twice ! "
"my over all experience stayig at taj mahal palace was good and i would certainly recommend my friends & relatives to stay in taj at any metro city, i would suggest taj management to keep on improving from time to time,"
"It was an excellent experience and the Taj Mahal delivered all everything, it was a memorable trip that will be remembered for time to come. I could not fault the hotel on anything. The spa , the restaurants were amazing the shops were awesome everything was just as expected and more."
This was my second stay at Taj and both times enjoyed the stay. Whole experience was very much 5 stars experience but that's comes with the price. I would highly recommended a stay for couple nights and experience Mumbai from great location. 
"Not finding words to describe memorable stay at The Taj Mahal heritage hotel near Gateway of India.  At the end of the trip Hotel management asked us what can be improved and he insisted on it. Even after lots of thought we could not find even a single thing which needs improvement.  Excellent hospitality,  caring and taken care of smallest need.  Best restaurant,  best breakfast spread.  After Taj of Agra this is second most photographs taken heritage building.  Small trip of hotel explained its first ever movie ticker,  air ticker counter.  2008 attack memorial simply bring tears in eyes.  Names includes even Lucy army dog who lost her life.  "
If you want to be Pampered visit the Taj Mahal Palace. The most romantic hotel in the city with its over 100 years history with the best in class service is the best place to celebrate special occasions. Right from the checkin to the stay and service they make you feel like a royalty. The lovely views from sea lounge to magnificent pool makes it a great experience. Thank you to the team for making my wife's birthday truly memorable. 
"We really enjoyed our time here, from the helpful and friendly (but not ingratiating) staff, to the simply wonderful food and the sheer enjoyment of being in such a beautiful, historic hotel. Our room (as with any on the 5th and 6th floors) included the services of a valet, as well as daily high tea and cocktails in the lounge. We were only able to take advantage of this once, but wished we had gone every day, it was so lovely.  Be sure to opt for breakfast at the Sea Lounge, and aim to go early enough (by 8:30 or 9am seems best) to get a seat with a view on the bay and the Gateway of India. The North and South Indian breakfast offerings were both prepared to perfection, but it was simply impossible to be able to sample it all as I had to leave room for the wonderful masala"
"We stayed at the Taj Palace wing from Aug 24 2017 to Sep 3 2017 (10 nights) we were well received, immediately at the Mumbai Airport, made comfortable which really indication  the impressive level at which the Taj operates.  Having our daily breakfast at the Shamiana was the best part of the day,  the sous chef Surendra Khambra went around daily talking to customers and spoke to us all those days making us feel comfortable, the food, options and truly gave it that personal touch. Few 5 star hotels chef who have large kitchens go that distance . He left us with memories which really touched us.  So also the Manager of Shamiana Rahul Malgudi another impressive Taj manager who made sure we were comfortable, and went out of his way to make sure.  Rajendra  and Eric both help serve"
Taj is renovating its rooms and is selling rooms at premium prices- despite the noise with the construction work! I thnk its called completely looting guests without offering anything much in return. It was a waste of my time and money to stay at the Taj Apollo Bunder and would have much rather stayed in a newer property at half the price! I dont recommend you stay here. Taj has lost any semblence of customer service and experience.
"Good hotel and value for money. You can expect everything what a 5-star hotel offers inside this beautiful picturesque building. There is pool gymnasium, different restaurants, different cuisines and many more."
"This place is fantastic. I personally would recommend the old part of the hotel, rather than the new tower annex - sure you don't get the view, but you get the most fantastic old world fused the modern.  I first visit as a kid and took the family there New Year 2017 - a 40 year interval between visits. As a kid I was awestruck. I was not disappointed on my return. The facilities are great - the swimming pool is unlike any other hotel pool on the face of the earth - it is almost 3.5m deep!! The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. The concierge were great with advice and organising anything required.  I heartily recommend a stay, for almost any circumstances and occasions."
The guest service is really great above the mark they define the true guest relation abalities how nice it would be if all the other hotels such a guest service thank you taj.The food and the room are truely great had a very good stay at Taj have been staying here in a regular basis and never they made me feel any change in there service and the comfort of the stay
Stayed in the Palace wing for the first time. Awesome if you like the old style look. Actually the best sleep night i had in my 2-week travel within India.  With Old buildings/wings there are always challenges. There was rain water leaking in the corridors.. but did not bother me at all. It was deftly take care of.   Breakfast was awesome with the variety served there. The Executive Lounge was lovely to relax and have a drink. All in all a great experience
"I had done the booking for Taj Mahal Palace Hotel on 6th September 2017, for 13th  September 2017 on line, and no confirmation was received. Today, on 7th Septmber, to my disbelief hotel has charged me for no show. It is unfair.I have done the booking again for 13th night. Hope hotel management takes corrective action."
"I honestly can't say enough good things about this hotel.  The service, the food, the attention to detail... all absolutely world class.  We arrived to a traditional Indian welcome and personally escorted to the room.  The in-house facilities were second to none (they even have a private plane service if you need it!).  I left a charger for my phone out and the housekeeping tied it up with a little bit of velcro (much like with a laptop charger) - impressive and I've kept the velcro - very useful!  Room service menu was fantastic with Chinese, local, Japanese, European options.  The pool was stunning and not too busy.  We used the chauffeur service a few times and the standard of vehicle and service were again, world class.  Lots of interesting (and very expensive!) shops in the"
"I along with my wife have stayed one night each on our birthdays over the last couple of weeks; the hotel is iconic and staying there takes one to a very different level of hospitality experience that may not be easy to emulate; it has to do with the explicit understanding of the customer without being overt about it; we live in Mumbai and the thought of living in a hotel within Mumbai was first as well;the two days spend in two different weeks were splendid with surprises built into the duration of our stay; starting with upgrade with room decorated for the special occasion; nice balloons and flower decoration in the passage and the bathroom; special pillow with ""happy birthday"" embroidered on the pillow cover! followed by birthday cake: fantastic: the view from the Palace Wing"
It is a land mark hotel with finest hospitality and service with smile.We enjoyed old Taj hotel rooms and decor with lot of antiques in passage.Rooms were very clean with finest linen.We found food prices exorbitant compared to other five star hotels in Mumbai.we enjoyed our stay very much and shall definitely stay again.
"Stayed here for 3 nights and the only disappointment I have, is that I didn't stay longer!!! Stayed in the Palace wing and it was worth every cent! Complimentary breakfast, complimentary drinks & snacks throughout the day, complimentary high tea each afternoon, complimentary pre-dinner cocktails and canapés, complimentary post-dinner cognac and chocolates, free Wi-Fi throughout. 7 restaurants, stunning pool. The staff could not have been more helpful if they tried. Nothing was too much for them. They genuinely wanted to ensure that you had the most enjoyable stay and were so full of knowledge. The rooms (Taj club room) were spacious, décor was beautiful, beds comfortable, amenities luxurious and plentiful. Salon & Spa facilities were amazing and well priced.There is not a single"
"Enjoyed 2 days stay at Taj Mahal Mumbai. Hospitality from check in to dining was excellent. Must see the Sunset ritual. The flute guy is amazing. The foods are delicious and personalized services is awesome. I was staying with my twins and whenever I stayed in any hotels they started saying by the evening let's go home dad, but first time they enjoyed a lots and wanted to stay more. Will visit again thank you team Taj."
"The staff was very very polite and great help. great history of indian culture and the vision of the promoter great antique piece by it self each room and each area is by itself an historian, Great view,"
This is a must if you are visiting Mumbai for the first time. I have travelled constantly for the last 20 years and this is definitely up there as one of the best. The staff are highly trained to ensure all guests are thoroughly catered for in every possible way. 
"We stayed at taj inspite of having our own home in mumbai, just to experience this heritage beauty. It started by surprsing us by updrading us to Taj Club room and we couldnt be happier. enjoyed pool side with beer and later 90 min SPA. Their exclusive Palace lounge added to our joy. Staff is very polite and helpful. Heritage walk was an experience. Morning buffet doesnt have many options for vegetarians which was unexpected. Overall, a memorable experience.   PS: There was a mixup towards the end where we were asked to checkout @3PM inside of having confirmed checkout @4PM. which was unpleasent"
"I had the distinct pleasure of staying in this phenomenal hotel for one week during a business trip.  I was extremely impressed with the amount of detail they take into caring for their clients.  Complete customer satisfaction is paramount and is evident in their door-to-door interactions.  This hotel had a great shopping mall on the bottom floor, abounding restaurants with delicious food and spectacular swimming pool.  The fitness center and their staff was fully accommodating to my needs and created a great atmosphere for a decent workout while on travel.  Proximity to walking through Mumbai and seeing the sites was also readily available from the hotel.  Can't wait to do it again!"
"Our guide Natasha was very knowledgeable and had given us an opportunity to visit Ravi Shankar Suite during check out. Front office staff, house keeping all seem extremely professional and I believe they could offer best service to the world from Taj Palace Hotel's framework. All the very best. "
"Friendly service, a great view and a relaxing ambience created by their live painist, Ms Patricia. Had a lovely cup of tea, at their 1st floor lounge, and thank you to Ms Patricia for some lovely music to set the scene. "
"We loved our stay at the Taj Palace in Mumbai. The quality of rooms and service by the staff are exceptional.  Two little things that bothered us: 1. The taxes imposed by Indian Government could come across as quite steep, 36% over the room rate.  2. The airport pickup for transportation to hotel was not fixed price. We were stuck due to local traffic and water logging and charge was tripled due to the extra time. "
What an amazing experience. An oasis in Mumbai. Reasonably priced for the quality of hotel and an absolute must of your budget can stretch to £150 a night. We ended a weeks trekking trip with a 2 night stay here and it was the prefect way to round it off. Perfect hotel in every way. 
Called in to this fantastic hotel fro Afternoon or High tea.  The Hotel is a old and historic building overlooking the Gate of India and the sea.   We were shown to the Sea view room up the Grand Stairs.  The room is fantastic and the food set out to impress.  The staff are extremely attentive and discreet.  We had a fantastic experience and would recommend this a a must in Mumbai.  Worth every penny.
"The best service!!!!!! I never had a greater service in a hotel. They provided me with everithing I need. Three times a day room service, perfect reception, niche people. Thanks a lot for your great support!!!!!!"
"For a five star hotel I left feeling as if I had something in the back of my throat!! the food was awful. I don't mind paying if I am getting good food, I was expecting something extraordinary for the rating, but got some quite mediocre."
"This is the Kohinoor of the Taj properties,such great warmth and service . Beautiful lobby,a huge painting by the famous painter MF Hussain at the reception area. Rooms overlooking the Gateway of India are awesome,specially during the rains. Great buffet breakfast,huge spread and a must have. The best Japanese restaurant in Mumbai,Wasabi...must have, expensive though."
"The stay was excellent in all Department Taj Group deserve compliments for satisfaction and value of money. The location of hotel is good and all the restaurants ambience is good, room were very clean and service was dedicated in all department."
Superb service and great breakfast!  My husband  stayed for 3 nights and we had enjoyed the hotel very much.  What stand the hotel apart is really the wonderful and helpful staff.  Service was top notched.  Room is slightly dated than expected but overall is still very well maintained.
"This hotel is outstanding and the staff are so welcoming and wonderful. We had a view of the pool and inside grounds. The architecture is stunning! The amenities were great and you really felt like royalty with marble bathrooms, large tub and extremely comfortable bed. The Sea Lounge offers great breakfast - I loved all of the Indian dishes! We had the best sushi ever at Wasabi restaurant - it's a must!"
"Everything was perfect : the professionalism and the kindness of the personnel, the beauty of the hotel, the food, the swimming pool, the spa and its very good massages. We loved it. If you go to Mumbai, go to the Taj Palace, it's part of the Mumbai experience ! "
"Taj Mahal Palace can easily be used as a synonym for rich and royal Indian Culture. Unmatched Hospitality, all together different hotel atriums and royal stay makes it one of the best hotels in India."
"We reserved a room in the Tower but were upgraded to the Palace wing, Gateway of India view.  Really wonderful beyond belief. Taj hospitality and service is impeccable, and everyone is very warm and personal.  Our room had all the amenities including a desk which we needed, comfortable bed, marble bathroom with best shower and luxurious bathtub.  Roomy. Beautifully appointed. An alcove with chairs and table where we sat and watched the nighttime light show on the Gateway, masses of people enjoying a visit there, taking in the views, umbrellas at the ready.    We were celebrating our anniversary, and one night the bed was covered with heart shaped balloons, a beautiful heart shaped flower arrangement with roses on the table, and a delicious chocolate cake.  The Sea Lounge is"
The welcoming of the guests are extraordinary and very memorable. It's an unique hotel with phenomenal staff service and hospitality. The food was world class. The daily house keeping is incredible. this is one of our best experience staying at Taj Palace. We got a best value of our spending as the price is very reasonable in comparison to this standard of hotels as per our experience.
"Our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace could not have been better. Everything, particularly the staff, but also all the facilities, were of the very highest standard, particularly welcome in view of Mumbai experiencing the worst monsoon rains for 15 years.  Strongly and unequivocally recommended.  "
"Beautiful place sea shore & harbour are happening places and enjoyed a lot food is very good , morning breakfast was superb staff very kind clean rooms the hotel history inspired me and special thanks to Mr selvakumar chauffeur for dropping us safely to airport due to heavy rains & floods it took 12 hours to reach he was very help full "
"I cannot explain how great this hotel is. Everything is 5* and the entire staff is so well trained, courteous and helpful that you feel part of the family. We had bad rains in Mumbai and I was stranded in another part and so was my colleague. I spoke to to concierge and they got him diverted to another Taj hotel where he was taken care of and the concierge called my every 30 minutes to check if I was okay. Just in love with the hotel and the staff!"
"We went on the heritage tour of the hotel when we arrived which put things in perspective - it has an amazing history but is beautifully kept with fabulous works of art and sculptures everywhere. We had a special room which meant we got complimentary afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks which was a fabulous treat and beautifully done but everywhere we ate in the hotel was sumptuous and the service impeccable. It's a site itself, full of history and couldn't recommend too highly."
An ideal weekend getaway when you don't want to leave the city. I would urge everyone to to stay at the Palace Wing. Do sign-up for the heritage walk. The restaurants are prohibitively expensive and you can't have all your meals at the hotel but there are tons of restaurants nearby.
"We spent our last 3 days in Mumbai at the Taj Hotel. The hotel is awesome: clean, beautifully with great service. The location in great ; close to all the tourist attractions but It is 1.5 hours drive from the airport. We use the hotel car to go around. The driver was very knowledgeable, there was no need for a tour guide. The only disadvantage was that all the restaurants at the hotel  (we dined at 4 of them) are ridiculously expensive and the food is less then average."
One-night stay to celebrate my birthday and it was fantastic! From the balloons and flowers in my room upon arrival to the outstanding service from the staff -- one of the best stays. Have breakfast in the Sea Lounge overlooking the Gates of India.
"Taj, the name reflects upon the royal Indian culture. Hotel excels in every aspect from hospitality to beautiful and opulent hotel infrastructure to food. The hotel is a landmark of Mumbai.Really wanna have one more visit there."
* best hotel I've ever stayed in  * Staff went above and beyond and were so helpful and friendly  * The only fault I can find was that there was no ATM in the hotel and there weren't many loungers by the pool * great location for exploring Mumbai Breakfast was excellent  Hotel is incredible   Would definitely stay here again 
"The hotel is very good as we are greeted at entrance and everything is taken care of, you can be completely rested. the food may be expensive and not up to the mark but overall it is awesome, i would surely recommend this hotel to others"
"I am booked at the Taj to arrive this Sunday night, and my experience so far has been frustrating to be polite.  In attempting to take advantage of a lower rate they cancelled my room reservation and it took repeated email to get them to reinstate the reservation.  Then, they said they have no record of an airport pickup, despite my forwarding back the email they sent confirming the arrangements.  Now I've sent them a final email asking them to confirm the room and the car and have received no response.    I had to do all of this by email as their website does not permit a guest to access or change an existing reservation, and their app is really just a mobile version of the website so of no help.  I am concerned that if they can't handle simple items before a guest's arrival,"
"I visited there on Saturaday, Hotel looked like heritage hotel. Nice staff, nice ambiance. Food quality is also good. But there smoothies are very bad. Their chef don't know how to make. It tastes bad. Even KFC crushers are much better and delicious than this. so avoid it"
"Went there during the second day of Ganesh festival . The decision to stay at Taj Mahal Mumbai was a blessing in disguise . One was impressed with excellent service standards whether in check in , Lounge and Resturant etc . second the Ganesh immersion procession taking place starting around 10 am was really worth enjoying"
"A memorable trip. Everything was perfect as well it should be. On 25Th. August, the day of departure, my wife developed a medical condition that was extremely painful. The staff rallied around and the help, assistance and support offered by them was beyond our expectation - we are grateful for that. Mr. Hussain Rizvi, the duty manager, took a personal interest in insuring that all assistance was timely and efficiently available. To sum up a Superb Hotel with a Superb staff. They don't make Hotels and train staff like that any more. Our thanks and gratitude to all the staff. I must mention that house keeping is often the unseen service of the hotel but a special commendation for them, they were excellent and well trained. And a special mention for the ""Butler"" service, it is a"
"The Staff need to learn a bit more professionalism. 1-2 incidents happened with me and the way the hotel staff i would say ""Behaved"" doesnt show the profession of service Industry.  Location and service are good but staff needs some behavioral trainings."
"It was a leisure visit to Taj along with the family. They arrange a heritage walk for the property which is the best implemented practice. The hotel is a business luxury hotel  but  I felt they should have some kids activities. The people in the hotel are very much service oriented AAA. The concirege people arranged DVD player ,DVD for us. But  also the moving watching in the room was taken to next level as they arranged complimentary Pop corn and Soft drinks for my kids. Thanks for that."
"Good but not Taj Quality. The rooms are nice and so are the amenities like the pool, steam room and fitness room. The food and choice of restaurants is very good but on the very expensive side. The sercvice at the restaurants is ok. Nothing special. Particularly at the Shamania restaurant. The atmosphere is ok-not taj Quality. It needs a renovation. Looks like a street restaurant. Service was well below standard like a 3 star. Location of this hotel is excellent. Close to a lot of places to walk to. Safe area. "
"Commendable service by all staff in this first visit, treated like a royalty! Especially worth mentioning is the dedicated service by the senior citizens staff over Bfast at Sea Lounge. They are constantly checking on me to make sure that my tea is filled, food is sufficient etc.. and on the 2nd day, they acknowledge me by my last name Which certainly impressed me! I Will be back with my family again for this royalty treatment. "
From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like royalty.  I simply can't recommend this hotel highly enough it is simply beautiful.  Every member of staff was utterly charming and determined to make our stay special.  This hotel is a divine oasis amidst the crazy world of Mumbai.  To stay at this hotel should be on everyone's bucket list as it is simply unforgettable.
Have no words.   Property is heritage. Great staff. Great service. Really enjoyed my stay. Short of words. How beautiful this heritage place is.  Really enjoyed and will surely come back. Food is awesome u can enjoy best view of Colaba 
"The staff is exceptionally good. They are so nice and service is great. The Palace treats you like you are really a King. The Buffet Breakfast is one of the best I have ever been to( Which includes Singapore, USA, Hongkong, Macau Venetian etc)"
I cannot rate this hotel and its wonderful staff highly enough. We were visiting Mumbai for our 25th wedding anniversary and the hotel did everything it could to make our stay special. We were thoroughly pampered and the hotel's location meant we could visit the Gateway of India at any time - truly special. This is a special hotel - beautiful rooms and food and service. I couldn't ask for more.
"Visited Masala Craft restaurant in Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai. First thing which I was noticed the attire of service persons inside, Authentic Indian dress. The hospitality was one of the best experiences. The most important was food. The main purpose of visit. Just one word....awesome. Perfect spices with best taste. Service was good to make it more delicious. They explained the specialty of dish we selected. They also expressed memorable gesture by a surprise. They brought cake to celebrate my wife birthday. It was a memorable evening and we must visit again."
"Amazing experience, worth every cent.  Will definitely be recommending to anyone travelling to Mumbai. Attention to detail beyond compare. Rooms incredibly clean, service impeccable.  Great location for some quick shopping at Colaba."
"Best service and good price for the food and drink, i saw there is good decoration better than the other hotels near the same area as well as the product is most important thing is that.over all the best service"
Taj is clearly the best hotel and the stay is made memorable by the very courteous service by one and every employee. I would strongly recommend this hotel for business as well as personal for holidays. Restaurants offer great food.
"Genuinely, the best service I have ever come across in the world, despite being a frequent traveller and staying in many luxury establishments that pride themselves on their personal, bespoke service. An underlying kindness and compassion comes through in every interaction with the hotel staff at this deservedly famous landmark. All our problems were dealt with swiftly and with a view to exponentially bettering our experience. This is the hotel I would send anyone to who's interesting in learning about true customer service, where each and every individual is treated as a special human being, not a room number. Every single detail has been considered and thought through, leading to a faultless stay overall. Truly wonderful, we can't wait to be back."
"Stayed for a night, had a very good time. Got a sea facing room the view of the Gate way of India was amazing.  The hotel staff are very warm and welcoming. Truly a 5 star Hotel.                       Nothing has to be said about such an established Hotel"
It was an honor to stay at Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai. Heart-touching welcome.Fast check-in at reception. Loved the tika and Tulsi mala ceremony.Escorted well to the room with a proper guide to the hotel historic information.Fantastic interiors and perfectly crafted each piece of art and fabrics.Architecture is just amazing.Rooms were comfortable with fresh fruits available on request.You feel Tajness as you enter the room.  Wah Taj! Wah!
"The service at Taj hotels is second to none. The experience at this hotel is truly amazing. The staff make everything extremely easy for you at all times. The food is absolutely delicious. The rooms the most comfortable you could ever want. The amazing extra things that they do to make your stay special like leaving lavender spray by the bed and putting a bookmark in your book for you trul leaves you feeling relaxed and special.  Thank you Taj Mahal Palace, I cannot recommend enough."
"Best in Mumbai, no doubts about it! Good service, more than excelent food in breakfast, perfect rooms and really close atention. We slept in the palace wing. It's worth!! I recomend it, and if I come back to Mumbai the staff will meet me again! Placed in the best area - Colaba"
"Excellent stay, good ambiance and superb location. Most enjoyable stay. lovely rooms clean and comfortable and located at the Gateway of India with lovely areas to stroll around. easily accessible and the food was very nice and i would say must visit this hotel."
"This was my first stay experience at Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai. I stayed for a day to celebrate my husband's birthday. This place has so much to offer, more than 6 restaurants and a lot of history.   We did not step out of the hotel for a second, as it has so much to offer. Stories of JRD Tata, to 26/11 attack. Hotel Walls speak of the history. Apparently, this is the second most photographed place in India, after Taj Mahal.   There is a hotel tour organised for residents at 5.30pm, everyday from the lobby, where staff member takes you through the history of Taj Mahal Palace and how Air India had a ticketing counter inside it.   Amazing touch of hospitality and history makes it a place to stay for sure.   I loved it and hope to stay again for my next visit."
Came here for high tea and what a treat it was. The buffet selection was incredible and they had an array of traditional afternoon tea options as well as Indian equivalent options. I was very impressed. The food was delicious and the service was unbeatable. The staff were extremely attentive and polite.
"The most amazing hotel in the world one off the best staff food restaurant room service swimming pool shopping the club lounge and the spa every thing is perfect and the concierge ,travel serves and secured "
"Below is my experience with Hotel Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai which I wrote as a review in Booking.com as I booked my stay thru them. Maybe I was not lucky but this what exactly happened  with me to please ensure prior to book with this hotel  Uncooperative and rude receptionist and imposing their perceptions and predetermined decisions on guest and trying to prove that they are always right. Guest as well as Booking.com are the reason of misleading results. Upon request to meet the duty Manager who haven't shown up but when insisted they introduced one of their colleagues, Hussain, as the Duty Manager who I recognized at first glance but did not want to argue further and decided to leave them with their mentality and accepted the way imposed to me"
"Elegance! Beautiful! Nice gym. The gym instructor, Imtiaz, is an amazing Instructor/Trainer.  I came to India for eye surgery. Imtiaz was extremely professional in conducting the training and very patient and sensitive towards my special needs. An asset for Taj Kids activities does not exist. No kids club. Limited nanny services.  Great for adults though."
"Great place to stay in Mumbai. Excellent Service, hospitality, and food. Mr. Divyesh of Shamiana was excellent. After a long day of meetings, returning to smiling staff greetings, excellent fragrance of the lobby, relaxing ambience, and to the room prepared for you to rest. Overall, Amazing experience."
The way they treat us make us feel like a king.. Good hospitality. Great service. Awesome place to stay with... Rooms were of high standards. Well qualified and trained staffs. Try once and you would love to live over there. 
The staff were very helpful and polite throughout our visit. We enjoyed the tour of the hotel. The restaurants that we dined at served a variety of dishes and the waiters were attentive. We would definitely recommend this hotel to others.
"THE most impressive thing Taj did for me is:  I was very sick and terribly weak when I checked out on Aug. 14. The person who checked me out asked me to sit in the lobby while he brought all the papers to me and also the Visa machine, and brought me water.  He then ordered a cool cab for me to take me to the airport.  I was scared of even doing this airport journey.  So by then a gentleman in a suit came to me and said not to be scared, that Taj would track my cab so their rep in the airport will meet with a wheelchair and take me through to the Gate, all at no extra cost to me.  The Taj airport rep was incredible.  I just sat in the wheelchair, while they did all my checking in.  Another incredible thing......this same gentleman in a suit told me I had asked for RT television"
"I stayed at the palace for 4 days. It is an amazing place with amazing facilities. It is a good gateway from the effervescence of the city. Totally recommend it. Service is amazing, food is extremely good. I was well liked after by everyone and if you need something they will provide it to you! "
Taj is synonymous to luxury but Taj Mahal Palace is more than that. It is lavish and royal. The view is breath taking and the location is he most prime in Mumbai. Hospitality and rooms are top notch. Once in a lifetime worth of experience.
From the moment of booking to the moment of departure the staff at the Taj Mahal Place Hotel displayed professionalism and first class service. This trip to celebrate a special event was enhanced by the care and attention that the staff gave to us. WELL DONE  
"I am always amazed by the hospitality of Taj group.being a frequent traveller almost visited all their properties in India..""When I say I want to pamper myself there is only one name in my mind TAJ""..my recent in Taj Mahal palace was a memorable one..booked a poolside view room with breathtaking view..service is incredible..jivaspa is one of the best spa in town.i pampered myself with a facial .please include Jacuzzi in you're property in some rooms for solo travellers .keep up the good work..overall defiantly visiting this property again."
"Thank you very much the hotel was the best. The personal were very welcoming, very kind , and very smiley . The food was awesome . If I come to India surely I must in the Taj Mahal palace. My holy day was more that I was waiting."
"I have always read and heard a lot about the Taj Mahal Palace hotel but it surpassed my expectations.  The service was like no where I have ever stayed before and the staff were polite and helpful with nothing being too much trouble.  This is a hotel you must stay in even for a short break.     The hotel was affordable for the quality provided and I would definitely use it for any return trips to Mumbai!    The bars and restaurants whilst high end provided excellent service and choices, thank you for a wonderful weekend break "
foid was spoilt no mobile network in the room very noisy as renovation going on not a great experience staff helpful and security check great restaurant rates quitee expensive food variety very limited
"The best - it always is. Ambience, service, warmth, food are always outstanding.  Just one request - pls see if you can introduce creme brulee as a dessert. Used to love it here but seems to be off the menu.  Keep it up and all the best "
"One of the great hotels in the world which you must experience at least once in your life, it is a beautiful, historic hotel with amazing staff and great facilities, the breakfast is a delight. The closeness to the Gateway to India is also a bonus"
The most beautiful place to stay in Mumbai. Enjoyed every moment of stay except at one point where a staff at hotel at pool side enquired us to make sure we stay at the hotel. Enquiring was not wrong but the way he did was wrong. He could have been polite and humble in asking our room number than being rude and straight on face. Rest was awesome.
"The Taj Mahal Palace is not just a Hotel it is a destination in itself in India. My husband gave me this surprise on our Anniversary and it was worth it.   Rooms - We stayed at the Luxury Grande room with sea view in the Palace Wing. The room was a delight with amazing view of Gateway of India and Sea. It was very spacious with world class mattress. I had my best sleep there.   Bathroom - Bathroom was pure luxury with Forest Essential toiletries and grand bath tub.   Staff - Staff is extremely courteous and polite. They greet you every time they cross you.   Food - We had our meals at Souk, Masala Kraft, Aquarius and Sea Lounge. All of them were amazing with a great variety of options. Souk and Sea lounge had beautiful view of city and sea while Aquarius was beauty by the pool. "
"A stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai is a must on everyone's bucket list. The staff are outstanding and can't do enough for you. The rooms hark back to the era of the Raj and the luxury for the very few - but now anyone can enjoy them. The Taj is an institution in Mumbai and is a real oasis in the made frenetic city of Mumbai. Try and stay in a Palace room, for an experience far removed from modern sterile hotels. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!"
"This hotel is worth spoiling yourself, even for one night.  The decor in the old part of the hotel is elegant, and the high tea looking out on the Arabian sea is fit for a Queen.  The high tea consists of wonderful cakes, exotic teas, and finger sandwiches.  It was a wonderful experience staying there, and the service was excellent.  The only problem was the service was too good, and got a bit annoying when the door was knocked on too many times to ask us if we wanted anything.  They actually gave us a Butler?  And he wanted to fold our clothes for us, in our room?  I want to add that the pool was lovely, and there is a ceremony that they have every evening lighting the candles that should not be missed."
"I was deeply impressed with the service efficiency and professionalism. I have stayed in many Taj hotels around India and I would rate this stay far ahead of the others in cleanliness, atmosphere, experience and service."
The Taj Mahal was amazing from the location to the rooms to the staff. We were welcomed in traditional style which was very special. It was our friends'wedding anniversary. The staff made it spectacular. We were upgraded which was a fabulous treat. Can't wait for the next visit
"This is the most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in a huge number of hotels around the world. It's not just the facilities, the quality of the rooms, the fantastic breakfast, the variety of restaurants and bars, or the amazing swimming pool, but the staff that really makes this place. Their attention to detail, service, respect, politeness, and overall cheerful totally dedicated helpful attitude makes this the incredible place it is. I would live here if I could and will most definitely return as soon as possible for an extended stay. "
"As you ever travel around Mumbai, take your time to experience the high level of hospiltality of this world's famous hotel. Enjoy the restaurants, the pool, the rooms, shopping and the warm service of the employees."
"I just loved this hotel and its history. The property is well kept and beautiful. Breakfast in the sea lounge was so enjoyable. Everyone wants you to have an enjoyable stay and is so kind. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Mumbai, hopefully in the palace wing next time."
"Sea Lounge is the best place for morning breakfast and evening snacks.. :) rooms are well appointed and equipped with all amenities.. Best part if the staff, all are so very well groomed and display very high level of hospitality.."
"Spent 5 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace in July. Loved this hotel so much , I did not want to leave the hotel. The staff were excellent. From the time of arrival at this hotel;the welcome ceremony to check in by Devia, we were treated like royalty. Our room overlooking the Gateway of India was luxurious and spacious. The architecture of this hotel and décor were amazing. I spent a lot of time just walking around the hotel and exterior enjoying the visual feast. Breakfast at the Shamiana was fabulous. I asked Suresh and Bhupesh to show me authentic Indian breakfast and there were just too willing to oblige. We had dinner at Masala Craft and the meal was excellent. The service standards are excellent and world class . The Taj  Mahal Palace does not live up to  world class"
"Upon arrival my room was upgraded to a suite, which made my stay even more magnificent given the magical backdrop. Staff are ubiquitous and always at hand to assist you in every way. Amenities seem endless and hotel offers sanctuary of tranquility from the sometimes bustling city that unfolds right across the hotel's gate. "
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a classic and beautiful hotel, well worth the stay. - Fabulous guest services and treatment, all the staff are extremely polite and always smiling. - The room was lovely - The food was fantastic  All in all we felt like kings staying at the hotel "
Experience of lifetime. The hotel staff make you feel that you are very special for them.right from check in till check out. must attend the 17:30 hotel tour so that you can know more about hotel .visiting again for sure.
"eEverything was superb, from the concerned emails before hand to resolve arrival details to the greeting from the most delightful staff. I make a point of arriving in India in Mumbai just to experience again this superb Hotel. The poo lis magnificent and the decor of the Palace wing is a joy just to wander in and admire. "
"Its very rare that i am convinced enough to give 5 stars to a property so wholeheartedly. I stayed one night innthe heritage wing - the room was fabulous, the entire hotel feels like a grand museum. The Hussain painting as soon as you walk in is spellbinding. However what set this place apart was the service - the staff were great and very courteous. I would specially like to recommend kamal who is stationed at the ladies washroom near the crystal room on the first floor of the heritage wing. I had to attend a function in the evening and was wearing a sari. It got a bit loose and i had to go to the washroom to fix it. Kamal saw me struggling with the sari and without me asking totally redrapped it for me in a couple of minutes, that too more fashionably and securely tham the"
"We stayed here twice during our 7 week holiday throughout India. Although not all our hotels were this luxurious, we made sure we stayed here twice. We arrived in Mumbai, and decided to book two nights in the Taj Mahal Palace Tower (not as expensive, but still worth it). When we were leaving the concierge actually told the taxi driver the wrong train station which caused us to miss our train. We arrived back to the hotel, where they apologised profusely. They knew we were staying again at the end of our trip. When we arrived there again, we found out we had been upgraded to the expensiveeeeee rooms and oh my gosh were we taken away with how amazing it was.  I felt bad actually, because you are in Mumbai where some of the poorest individuals live, you walk out of your hotel door"
"I have stayed in many hotels in my life, for business and private. The Taj Mahal Palace however is the nr. 1 of hotels in the world for me. They set a new standard for service and quality. From the moment I stepped in their car at the airport until check out everything was flawless and perfect. Let me walk you through my experience: 1) The driver was waiting at the airport and drove me quickly to the hotel. The hour drive is convenient because they provide you with WiFi, so you can tell your loved ones at home you arrived safely 2) Upon arrival I was welcomed at the car by my name and directly brought to my room. The check in was done in the room with an Ipad, so this went quickly and efficent 3) The rooms are very pretty and spacious. The bathrooms luxurious and well equipped."
After a prolonged check-out we wanted to shower. Serveral personal items had been stolen. The hotel managements proceedures include an investigation in which the first accusation is the customer didnt have these stolen items
"i can't wait to return to the Taj! This stay was our best ever! In my opinion, this hotel has EVERYTHING! Lovely rooms, ultra-polite staff, wonderful food, superbly clean and well maintained throughout! This is the first hotel ever, where I have stayed and been able to rate everything as perfect! This has never happened before anywhere else!"
"The location can't be beat -- within walking distance of most of the major sights in Mumbai. Extremely satisfied with everything at the hotel .   The best asset of this hotel is the staff. Helpful and kind, always smiling. a complete destination for home away from home and it is fantastic hotel and great experience"
"The experience my family got here was unmatched and unforgettable. Everything about this hotel is impeccable. As soon as you enter the rotating glass gates, you are transported to a luxurious world, where a gentle fragrance pervades every nook and corner of the hotel. The entire hotel is really a palace, and you will enjoy the grandeur every moment of your stay. It is the best in every possible way. I could not find a single fault here. The staff are extremely courteous and helpful. My son was offered a soft toy along with the welcome drink, and he was thrilled.  There are many things about this place which can not be properly explained in words, hence I recommend that it be experienced first hand. My family and I had the time of our life there. Even the Nalanda Bookstore had a"
"After a very long journey, I was met at the airport by a hotel driver who kindly pointed out the sights on the way to the hotel. The checkin process was so simple....I was greeted by a very nice host who escorted me to my room, had my bags delivered and sent a complimentary beverage. The room was well laid out for relaxing as well as having a work area. The rich history of the hotel can be seen throughout the property. Take time to look at the photographs. There are multiple restaurants at the hotel. Souk was outstanding for service as well as food. The chef was very accommodating. Excellent experience."
Well maintained rooms.good housekeeping service.nice food.a well maintain property of Taj hotels.groomed staff with proper smiling face.a complete destination for home away from.home.fantastic hotel ..  
"The hotel is mostly taken by its name and repuation its a very clean and vintage type hotel,but by the price its given its very overated and tight rooms and not many modern facilties that you can enjoy"
"Extremely satisfied with everything at the hotel. Excellent, fresh and diverse food and drinks. Very satisfied by the staff, and especially by  the person in charge of cleaning our room, Narayan. He was very kind and polite, paying special attention to detail, and was attending to every need of ours. He was always responding promptly to all our requests. He even decorated the floor with flowers (different decoration every day), and left small presents for us every day.  "
"Amazing hotel, at a great location, just opposite the Gateway of India. Breakfast was excellent! So was the room! Definitely a memorable stay! The best asset of this hotel is the staff. Helpful and kind, always smiling. A hotel where you are treated like a royalty! "
"We loved our two night stay at this iconic hotel. It's a must visit place to fully experience Mumbai as its part of the history. Of course it's a bit on the expensive side, but it's worth the money. The quality of rooms and service is exceptional. Would love to stay at this hotel again in future."
"This was our second time and like privies time they ungraded us to palace wing as it was our anniversary. Staff are extreamly humble, friendly and Curtious. Everyone in the hotel makes u feel like a princess. Food is very good. We loved the palace lounge services. We will visit many more times. This is our Fev property. "
"A very pleasant stay at the hotel with family , it's really nice to stay in place wing with sea view and the hospitality is also nice .  Some suggestions for  improvement for the hotel also left at the reception desk place wing to the manager. ( important one for the hotel shared as being an Indian we can't afford to have for our international visitors to the hotel )   Good food and nice view . Must visit if the trip is for experience mumbai   :) cheers mumbai  "
Second visit following on from an excellent stay last August.   I arrived very late at night and was grateful check-in was super efficient and I was quickly shown to my room in the Palace wing. It was very much like the room I had stayed in before but with a pool view this time. Quite a small room but beautifully furnished and extremely clean.   I enjoyed relaxing my the pool but as I have since pointed out to the management the hotel staff need to make more effort to keep non-resident visitors out of the pool area. The number of tourists milling around the hotel was the only negative aspect. At times there were queues to get into the hotel (there is good security) which residents have to line up in! The lobby seats are hard to secure as they are being used by sightseeing and
"We stayed for 3 days and 2 nights for business purpose and were had wonderful experience here.  staffs  + superb service level + quick response for our response  + polite, eventhough the tight security they still greet and served us politely  breakfast + no comment, everything superb + try sea lounges, the window seat facing directly gateway of india  facilities + 24hours gym with sauna and steamroom + huge swimming pools + SQ Office inside the building, really helpful to check my flight  locations + Directly facing the gateway of india + close to starbucks, colaba causeway (art market) and restaurants - ATM quite far from hotel  rooms + comfy bed with lots of pillows + fast internet at room + 4 bottle of mineral water provided - the bathroom marble kinda slippery - minibars"
Certain monuments are symbolic of our heritage and are iconic in their own rights. Was super excited to be staying at India's first and the most hallowed hotels. The perfect location for any hotel and nothing more can be asked from it. The staff was courteous and prompt on all our demands. Would recommend everyone to stay at least for night to experience it.
"What a wonderful experience. We stayed in the Palace wing overlooking the pool. Staff were extremely helpful and couldn't do enough for you. The food in the restaurant was excellent. This hotel must have the nicest swimming pool anywhere, with the temperature of the water being spot on! Our stay here was so relaxing and a perfect end to our tour of India"
"Historical location, fantastic rooms, gives a great sense of current as well as colonial era. The staff are excellent and attention to detail, especially the room cleaning and thoughtful turn down service. One of our favourite hotels. Strongly recommended, ensure you stay in the palace wing. "
"One of the best hotels in the world. Beautiful rooms, great restaurants, service and shopping.  My room overlooked India Gate in the old wing and the view was amazing. The hotel is a world onto itself. Loved the spectacular flowers in the lobbies, the pool and the food. Modern bathroom."
"No words to it, stunning heritage property very well maintained, stayed in the palace wing pool facing room on the second floor.   Clean and spacious rooms.  The staff really cares and responds immediately.  Delicious Pancakes in breakfast.   "
"Excellent hotel with awesome location. Although in the high price range for the people who are not in sync with Mumbai property prices, your stay here makes you feel like royalty specially if you are staying in the palace wing. The buffet breakfast is lavish in spread, quality and hospitality."
"We have stayed in this lovely hotel multiple times, and recommend you choose the ""Heritage"" wing, as it provides rooms of the most luxurious caliber, in a unique architectural setting.  The hotel was ravaged by terrorists about 10 years ago, but has been meticulously restored.  A memorial to those lost in this horrible event can be viewed from the lobby.   Our room had every conceivable amenity, and a magnificent harbor view, with its endlessly changing sights of boats and ferries traversing it.  The restaurants in the hotel, particularly the Japanese, are excellent."
"Great hotel and a fabulous experience! No other hotel comes close to giving such a fabulous experience like that one gets in the Taj Mahal Palace. This hotel is indeed one of the world's best hotel. The staff are very courteous and genuinely makes one's stay so comfortable, right from the time of check-in until one departs. Having stayed twice just makes me to come again and live the experience again and again!"
"I visiter this hotel during May-17.I was here on earlier occassions also.As always, the grand interior with beautiful flower arrangement was enchanting.As per my request I was accomadated in heritage wing which is a class in itself.This time there was a high inflow of guests putting the staff under work pressure despite that the staff was ever co-operating and polite.This time I happened to see evening ritual performed by the staff,it was really beautiful and flute (bansuri) music was very nice.This is a memorable place"
This was our first visit to Mumbai and taj was recommended to us by friends ... the hotel is just huge and historical ... the restaurant are great  but the Indian one not so great ...the surrounding is perfect too as it is located in collaba one of the finest streets in Mumbai good restaurants shops around but we have heard from the locals that prices are doubled here ..the concierge were so helpful security was great but the corridor is quit noise and u can hear the doors slamming and ppl running and talking all the time ... to be honest it was nice experience to try the taj as it is a historic place in Mumbai ....so even if ur not staying there by them a visit for a cup of tea        
"Unsafe and dirty.  This is exactly the false 5 stars hotel to avoid. Plenty of people, all polite but we arrive at 1 o'clock morning and the room was not ready with the extra bed for my children. I use the exit stairs to see if the security was good enough and it took them more than 5 minutes to find me. In 5 minutes, a lots of bad things can happen. On the morning breakfast, at 7 o'clock, half of the employés who serve you have dirty  Cloth , jacket and pans. The bath room was also dirty, and they agree with me, it was their mistake. A lots of apologizes, but the bill to pay stay the same, never meet the 5 stars hotel expectations. Then if you want a real palace, if you want a real 5 stars hotel, you should find a other hotel. Plenty of them who are better than this one, who"
"Stayed at the fabulous Palace Wing of the hotel - there was nothing that wasn't perfect about the stay. No hotel in the Taj Group, whether in India or abroad, comes even close to this Crown Jewel of the Group."
"we had a wonderful stay at the Taj palace. the view is magic, and it is definitely the best location in Mumbai. great service, and great staff .  this hotel is a true gem in India. I will definitely stay here again"
One of the most popular hotels in mumbai. Location and services are pretty good. But the reservations team is sort of unpleasant to deal with. They are slow in responding and not happy with customer queries. I hope Taj management notices this and train their reservations team better.
"True to the name The Taj Mahal hotel is in, every manner a palace. The minute you enter till you check out you are taken care off. The rooms are beautiful. The whole walk through the hotel is royal if you observe the small things like the chandeliers to the flowers to the showpieces.  They make you feel like a royalty.  The food is great too. Also you can indulge in shopping with LV, Dior and many more.  "
"Booked asea view room, given a corner suite which was odd but fine. The hotel isan amazing oadis of calm where nothing is too much trouble. The setting is fabulous and the pool ara and outside seating is lovely. Lots of nooks to sit and people watch. Only fly in the ointment wad a rather pushy pool atendant telling my husband he couldn't take photo's of me in the pool. Looking back we should have asked him to go away. The food is expensive but if you can book breakfast and go for the Indian option.  All in all a great place to stay and well worth the cost."
Few days back I visited to this hotel the occasion was very special that was my birthday as We entered in this hotel the hotel was little bit busy but ours welcome was very good and traditional we get a room on 11th floor the room was good and all the staff was very helpful specially that room service guy who served us a delicious biriyani and that chef who came to meet us grinning_facegrinning_facegrinning_facethanks a lot Taj
"We spent two days here last week. Great stay, everything at the expected high level of service. Particularly appreciated the fresh flower display in the lobby, it was a huge bouquet of roses on the day we arrived. And the front desk & restaurant staff seemed to have been specially selected for their good looks : - )"
"Being such a historical landmark in the conclave of hotels, suring my stay i realised exactly why. The politeness of the staff, the warm traditional welcome and the super modern luxurious rooms...this hotel has a very different feel in itself. Be in being locked out of your room at 3 AM or the lavish breakfast spread, the service and the personalised attention you get never disappoints. Plus its gorgeous location places you in a timeless zone of Mumbai, with stunning views, great food outlets and proximity to all the major landmarks. Would definitely recommend a sip of tea at the Sea Lounge and a walk form the hotel to The iconic Gateway of India...plus a peak at the luxe stores downstairs is great therapy ;)"
"I have been staying at this hotel quite regularly for quite sometime now and have given this hotel 5 starts earlier in my review. No doubt this hotel is one of the best properties in mumbai but the hotel has recently gone under renovation and that too is being done is parts ( because they don't want to loose the business ) and i feel it is really unethical on their part. They won't admit to the renovation but it's better to stay away from the hotel for at least 6 months.   Don't book this property if you mind hearing constant hammering and drilling during the daytime.   If you ask them, they would say it must have been an emergency repair but their floor staff admit's to the renovation."
"I visited the taj 30 years ago and back again with family for three nights last week. The hotel is still  outstanding as it was back then.  From the cleannes of the room,  excellent service and location in south mumbai (colaba), this hotel  is a true gem in India. I will definitely stay here again. "
"It was one of my child would wish to have Cup of Tea in World Famous Taj Mahal Hotel . But God made me so happy by granting me Add ON like Stay , Food and also the Tea with My Family . Both of my Children were very happy with Swimming and My wife with Luxory and ambience of the Hotel , The Hotel Management was Superb my Upgrading my Std room in Tower to Heritage Taj Mahal Palace with Sea facing View. Thanks and Great Regards to entire Taj Mahal Palace team"
We were upgraded to a room in the older Palace wing. Worth doing. It was full of history with beautiful architecture. The pool was relaxing with expensive but delicious lunch at the poolside. It is minutes from the Gateway to India and overlooks the Arabian Sea We stayed one night before flying on to Goa but it was  an unforgettable visit and staff went out if their way to offer their help 
"We stayed here for one night at the end of our travels and are so pleased that we did. A wonderful hotel, steeped in history. Service cannot be faulted, very attentive and friendly. Thanks to Devia at check-in. We enjoyed wandering the hotel, seeing all of the different rooms, relaxing by the pool. The hotel tour was interesting and worth doing. A memorable stay."
"This is THE Hotel to stay, at the least once in your lifetime. Amazing experience from the time we arrived (infact even before we arrived) till the second that we departed from the Hotel.  - the ambiance: No words for it, a home to be cozy and pamper your self. - the service: I can't expect more from anyone around the world to be as good, humble, the best, ""at your service"" people among all the hotels you have experienced. - the food: C'mon, Can someone really serve you food the way Taj serves you. NEVER!. Delicious food with the extreme of varieties you can ever think of for a breakfast. service?? outstanding ppl out thr. - Additional services provided: I booked the Taj Tower standard room - May be because it was my birthday, they upgraded it to:     . A deluxe luxury room"
"Absolutely amazing hotel - this is where we started our trip through India, and the other hotels had a hard time keeping up with this! We stayed in the old wing of the hotel, which is extremely comfortable, luxurious rooms, and has an amazing sense of history - along with awesome views over the Gateway of India. Dinner at Morimoto was fabulous - probably the best Japanese I've had, and the buffet breakfast was comparable to Sunday Brunch in most other places!"
We loved our stay at the hotel! We have seen the hotel from outside many times but never thought we'd actually stay at the hotel. This time we however got the chance and it is definitely a once in a life time experience! SUPER friendly staff and our view from the room was directly towards Gateway of India. Only problem was really that there was a bit of extra water in our bathroom (they would need to add an extra gutter there). The pool was awesome and we also got to see the older part of the hotel. Our next goal is to stay in one of those rooms ;)
"Best Hotel we ever stayed. Thanks for the upgrade from Tower to Palace Wing with all the amenities like free tea, coffee, biscuits and fruits in the Palace Lounge or free Newspapers (5)! We will come back!"
"So i recently visited this place as i run a food and travel blog so just wanted to see this place too as im a huge fan of Taj palace hotel delhi .. so wanted to see this one too.. so i came for a day.. it took around 1hour from mumbai airport to the hotel .. so i reached in the hotel around 2 ..checked in to the hotel.. had a coffee as my welcome drink.. it was great,\  so i tried a few dishes from sea lounge and golden dragon that day..   and atlast the lavish breakfast spread .. one must have the break in the taj mahal hotel.. may breakfast was included in the packagae.. <3  thank you had a great experience  INSTAGRAM jazzfoodtravelshop  :)"
"Arrival and departure was fast and efficient. Wet area was nice and clean. But when I tried to fill my bath tub, there was a gush of dirty and rusty water from the tap. Quiet shocking. Didn't expect that at the TAJ."
"This hotel is truly one of the greats.  If you have the chance, do not pass it up, stay here, you won't regret it.  It is run like a well oiled machine and the food, drinks and especially the pool and facilities are on another level.  Not only is this hotel steeped in history, but it at the same time features all the  modern conveniences you could want."
"Amazing stay I had at hotel taj...... the food at shamiyana was mind blowingsmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyesI njyed stay over here, desserts was superb,, ,,,,, there are many delicious dishes and varieties... mind blowing rooms awsome service thumbs_upface_blowing_a_kissmust visit "
"The brunch at Shamiana was very good!!! Awesome Desserts !!! The Chocolate Orange ice cream was super!!! Except that the timing should be extended to 4pm instead of 3.15pm,so that u can have in peace if you have come late and don't have to rush to wind up,otherwise food and service 5 stars!!! Special mention of steward Suresh for his excellent service "
"A quick dash into mumbai to attend a business conference at the Taj itself took me to this heritage property   To begin with, I was checked into the towers wing which I was not too impressed with - they also had renovations going on which I found disturbing - I was promptly shifted to  the palace wing which was more or less what I expected out of a Taj room - classy, elegant and roomy ...   The sea lounge is as always an amazing place to just sit and look out at the sea id recommend breakfast there if you are staying at the palace wing   All in all to experience the great indian hospitality i would surely recommend the Taj Mahal Mumbai   Rating 9/10"
"Excellent hotel for business or pleasure. Old style charm with high quality discreet service. Club rooms are very useful when travelling on business as they give access to the club lounge, allowing a quiet working space which serves food and drinks throughout the day."
I expected 1st class service and was surprised that I received even better Nothing to fault and will certainly recommend this to all friends and clients Cannot speak highly enough of the well trained informative staff. One small annoyance was that my 24 yr old daughter could not enter the bar as the minimum was 25 yrs old. A stupid rule
A lovely heritage hotel. Great rooms. Great service. Great food. Great Location. If I have to write it will not be enough. A experience that will always be there in my memories. A lovely stay at this heritage hotel.
Hotel with character. Must stay at Palace wing. Sea view is amazing. Food is great. Walking distance to Nariman point. Caring staff. I can confidently stay here with my family.  More activities for kids will be useful.
"I was in the Harbour Bar of Taj Mahal Palace.  Definitely the best bar in India. Very kind service by Mahesh and Akshay.  Both made my lonely evening to an advenrture in tasting beers around the world. India, Germany, UK to mention a few.  Prices are high, but place and people leverage it much more ... love it. Thank you."
I love everything about this place from the staff to the smell of her ! It's just get inside you the history good-and bad the room are beautiful the flower display something else staff are so friendly and helpful this lady just has so much class can't wait to be back on the 2/ 8 for four nights  Brodes nz
Very nice hotel. Like hotel services . Hotel staff is very good and rooms are very nice and clean. Everything in this hotel is very nice.  It was a memorable experience for my family. I got sea facing room in palace views was awesome to see high tide. Nearby area is very nice t walk and in main part of city
"Overall good but Toilets are painful as they don't have cleaning through water facility. Dental kit, Shaving Kit and comb were not there which are necessities. Shamiyana is a good place to have Indian food and sea lounge for morning breakfast. Pool is very nice but pool side snacks are over priced."
"So many things to tell!!!!  First it  is impressive first to stay in hotel which represent the dream of one man ( Jamsetji Tata ). The Hotel is beautiful the ornament, the flowers, very impressive. The localization  is really interesting as it is possible to have walk around  and it is not far from some restaurants. The welcome was very warm. We have been quickly been taken in charge and we did not have to wait to get our room, 6th floor, the way it has been design  is really nice, and we appreciate the old books put here and there. The Room decoration was nice, it is kind of luxury vintage, with a modern bathroom. The contrast is harmonious. The hotel organize an historic tour of about 40 min, interesting , you can learn that at the opening the cost was from 6 rupees"
"The hospitality of hotel is amazing, the staff is very friendly, polite and always smiling. The property is amazingly clean, been old its like living in a palace. Has a huge swimming pool.  Overall super stay."
"Being a all time lover of Taj. This place is specially my fav. Right from the amazing helpful staff to the great food and the wonderful scenic location, this place has been just wonders. We had a bit of a problem in the Indian restaurant where my child got stuck in the chair which they should really take care of but otherwise all well here. "
This Hotel is good but the staff thinks they are GOD. They are arrogant which is not good for a hotel like Taj Mahal. What value a good infrastructure and location can add if staff is not good? we could observe that not only' for us' but also for the other guests from Middle East (eg sitting next to our table on breakfast)
"There is just something so royal about staying here. We are Indian, but live in Singapore, so it was fun playing the NRI tourist. Loved the warm traditional Indian welcome. Super loved the complimentary upgrade to the palace wing, which came with complimentary access to the Palace lounge, and breakfast at the Sea Lounge.  Everything about the place is just superlative. I joined the complimentary hotel tour in the evening which takes you through the hotel's impressive history, and makes you feel that much grander when you know the august personalities who have stayed here before you. Waking up to the sea / Gateway view was awesome - just wish the windows were bigger, but that's the downside of staying in a building which is more than a 100 years old, and we can live with it!"
"Stayed here for one night and day. 5 star experience all the way from check-in, stay and check-out. Would definitely stay here again. Location is a big bonus because it is next door to street shopping (Colaba) and also across the street from the landmark, India Gate."
"Thanks to all at Taj for an amazing experience and especially:  - Anant at the dining service who took great care of me when i was sick  - Ganesh at room service who gave me a special gift for my Shiva altar in the room and who came in regularly with evhery thoughtful offerings and help.  - Imtiyaz at the fitness service who guided me in my morning workouts with an abundance of help advice about fitness, health and training. He is a very good trainer with great energy and passion for what he does, I had a great time working out with him, it was super motivating and informative."
"Some places just have a mesmerizing aura about themselves that is capable of blowing one's mind away. Taj Mahal Palace is one such place that has fascinated me since times immemorial. Having visited Mumbai all those years ago I still remember having been blown away by the opulence of the place and  deciding to give it a visit next time i am in the city.  Therefore having to pick a place for us as newly weds,  me and my wife got the perfect opportunity to stay at the Taj and etch its memory into our lives forever. From the moment we stepped in, it was ethereal. Entire palace speaks tonnes of history and radiates grandiose.  Upon having learnt about our marriage,we were upgraded to a luxury room in the palace wing and boy was that the making of an experience of a  lifetime.The"
"My family and I recently travelled to India. We stayed at the Taj twice because we enjoyed the experience so much. The reception, the service, the friendliness, the amenities were all top level. DIning, relaxing, asking for advice, travel plans were all taken care of with ease. We especially enjoyed the service of Sanket in the Aquarius Lounge who gave us insights into Indian life and Hotel history. My 12yr old son is certain the taj is the 'best hotel in the world'. He may be right. Thank you Taj & staff for making our stay so memorable. regards Troy Family"
"The place to stay in Mumbai, if you have the money. The most striking thing is the service quality - all the staff are polite, friendly and super-efficient. The hotel has multiple really good restaurants. The Souk has amazing Middle Eastern food and a wonderful view. I loved the huge outside pool, but the monsoon limited my chances to enjoy it! Their car service to and from the airport is wonderful. On the way back a guy met my car, and walked me to the check in desk so I did not get lost."
"We booked a club room in the Palace wing for our 1 night stay post cruise.  Loved the area, directly by Gateway to India, and the extras that came with the club room, albeit very expensive. Although we informed the hotel that we were staying in a club room in Palace wing and could they direct us to the check in, we were checked in by the main reception on ground floor, would have preferred to have checked in as advertised on the club floor.  Also breakfast was a little disappointing, limited choice, and service was a bit hit and miss, but the views from our table made up for it.  Service in the club lounge was excellent, and nice cocktails. Chauffer transfer back to airport was 1st class. It was a great conclusion to our holiday but it was probably a little too expensive to"
We stayed their last week. Rooms and bathroom are very spacious with all  necessary amenity. But the water pressure in shower needs some improvements. Less pressure and force in water. Rest brilliant and symptoms spread of buffet in breakfast. 
"The Taj Mahal Palace went through major renovations and it shows - the rooms are modern and well appointed, with all the technology needs for your stay like USB ports, free and reliable wifi and multi-country power outlets.  The hotel has enough good restaurants for any taste - Chinese,  Japanese , Indian, etc.  The pool is fantastic and the gym is well equipped.  "
The name define the standards. Keep it up full marks. 10 out of 10. right from the check in process to the check out process this hotel takes good care of you. multiple food options. great view. good location. dont forgot your camera
"Stayed at The Taj Mahal Hotel Tower Wing on business for a few days early July. It was great to return to this hotel and the experience was pretty good. The location is great next to The Gateway. The welcome and the stay was very good and comfortable. Quality and Taste of food was fantastic, and was customised to requirements."
Extraordinary hospitality with impeccable staff at service.Most humble and politeness as alwys;and  expected from any of Taj properties around the world.A previliege to have been associated with Taj group of hotels since many years.
Unfortunately I didn't have the stay I was expected. I understand that as its the quiet season its the optimum time for the hotel to complete maintenance work but you would expect them to close that section of the hotel so it didn't interrupt peoples stay. I was in a room next to the lifts were maintenance was taking place that weekend therefore the whole time while i'm my room i was able to hear banging and drilling etc. Not the relaxing stay I was hoping for. This continued until 7.30pm and then started again the following morning around 9am. As the point of my stay was to relax in a luxury hotel after a stressful few weeks this was not what I wanted. I was woken up for chocolates and a guide book to be delivered at 9.45pm...I felt that was quite late to disturb someone
"This is my second stay at the Taj Mahal Palace, and this time I stayed in the Heritage Wing.  The  hotel is wonderful.  The location can't be beat -- within walking distance of most of the major sights in Mumbai.  The service is very attentive.  Pretty much, anything you can want the staff will try to provide.  The room was nicely appointed.  There was a light switch console next to the bed, and you could control virtually all the lights in the room by pressing the buttons on the console.  This time, I stayed in the Heritage Wing instead of the Tower.  The Heritage Wing is like a museum.  The interior architecture is beautiful, and throughout the hallways are museum-quality artifacts.  I spent  about two hours one night just walking from floor to floor viewing the various"
This hotel manages to blend the style and service of the past and the convenience of today. Every member of staff wants to give you the most amazing experience but yet are very discreet.  Highly recommended.
"There are some hotels that claim to be 7 or 8 stars by having gold coloured taps and appealing to those festooned with cash but lacking in taste, style and discretion.   This is not one.   Possibly the most luxurious if not the most famous hotel on the sub continent.  The BBC made a series about this place.   The setting is not a palace in Jodphur or high in the western ghats. It is however *the* destination in Mumbai and is astride the gate to India. But the style and quality inside are the finest you can find anywhere in the world. This is added to a level of service and attention to detail that takes the sublime and creates the unbelievable.   An experience that must be experienced. Worth a trip to Mumbai solely to experience.   "
The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and all its staff are absolutely perfect. There were absolutely no complaints from us and every request was catered to immediately. The staff are so warm and friendly and go above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect.
"This is the best hotel in town. Facing the ocean and the Gate of India, this iconic building hosted so many famous artists, presidents, royals, vip, movie stars... Suggest you to book your room in the old building instead of the new tower side, to feel the taste of a Maharaja style of living. Staff, service, food, furniture, linen, amenities: everything is perfect for your satisfaction and enjoy. My only regret is about the new bookshop: use to be a great place to visit and shop with its huge art book and travel guide choice, has been restored to make it like an anonymous hotel store."
Indian Hotel Experience Good hotel and good experience. I will repeat. I really appreciate the reaction of the hotel to the comments of the customer to some service that was not at the right level. this indicates the level of service of the good hotels. Congratulations Regards Mariano Santos
There's not much I can say except that a trip to the Taj is the best holiday you can ever have! There is nothing to improve about this hotel or its miost excellent service. Amazing! best in the World! No exaggeration.
Excellent facilities and great courtesy all round by the staff. However some minor improvement work was going on near to our room but that didn't affect our stay too much.  Fantastic location. However got the room with a city view. Would have greatly admired if got the sea view... that would have been awesome..
"The 'old wing' of the hotel is most elegant and historic. The antiques, decor and lay out gives one the feel of staying in a palatial museum. The ""new"" Tower is no more than any above average high rise 4-star hotel..."
It is a perfect match for both business & leisure travellers. The staff is very courteous; would like to mention Mr Rahul & Ms Deepshikha from Shamiana who took a very special care of ours. The lady & Mr Natarajan at the check out were very helpful & humble to assist. I've left thank you note letters for core teams at the reception please share with them.. Overall it is a very fantastic hotel with very scrumptious meals & top class team. Thanx #team_taj_mahal_palace for the lovely stay
"Recommended to friends and family. Good location, clean, friendly staff. Apart of renovation noise, overall experience  was great. Try to add more  HD TV channels (current available channels are with poor quality display)"
"One of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in in my entire life. Class experience from check in to leaving. Luxury and perfection at every possible level. The staff gave us both an upgrade to a suite which had 3 bathrooms, our bags were unpacked for us, we had complimentary cocktails and lunch, the pool was beautiful, the staff were attentive, what more can I say."
"I've been a member of TIC for over 13 years - GOLD for about a decade. Seen the deterioration in the programme over the last 5 years. They are not generous like Hilton Honors or Starwood Preferred Guest, which takes very good care of their premium customers. Redemptions over the last few years have also been a challenge on TIC."
"Best hotel in mumbai .It is fate to be in this hotel .Best service .Luxury environment  . Food is excellent.  There is butler service in palace area Never seen this . The view is great as it is opposite to sea. There is stores in the hotel live lv,rolex etc "
"The Taj Mahal Palace is just as grand and impressive as you'd imagine and from the moment you arrive it's clear you're in for a special treat.   I have to admit I knew very little about the hotel before arriving. My colleague and I had some meetings in Mumbai and we booked here simply because of its close proximity to our first meeting. So you can imagine the surprise when our driver pulled us up to this impressive palatial structure.   Right from check-in you're made to feel special with a traditional necklace and welcome drink. My colleague and I were upgraded from tower rooms to the palace which I really appreciated. We were then given a tour of the hotel and told about its rich history. The hotel grounds are beautiful, the pool area is a quiet sanctuary from the hustle and"
This is such a historical hotel - so much character and story.  The staff is overwhelmingly friendly and in such a good way you feel very welcomed.  The low season allowed us to stay for three nights at a great price.  The views from the old tower were breathtaking - we were upgraded and it was appreciated.  The breakfast was always a treat and the location was perfect for us to walk around and felt safe the whole time. The only negative thing I would say is that it is quite costly to get a hotel car to and from airport - other than that I highly recommend this hotel when staying in Mumbai.
"The Taj charges premium rates, but can't provide services/quality that even a 3 star hotel would provide.  The concierge, check-out, reservation management, and even restaurant services were very subpar.  Will not be providing my business to them any longer"
"I have visited hotel café at 10 pm in night. We ordered for a pair of cold coffee, as it was lowest among the list. The taste was worst and it cost almost 400 bucks per coffee including GST and 170 rs per water bottle.  Though the price tag is high, tge ambiance suits the price.  You feel so enthu in that ambiance. Best part is you can take selfies and also put on your timeline, they won't stop you... "
"Stayed as part of a tour but has to be one of the best places I've stayed. All staff friendly and called me by name, rooms have all you want, and I had a great view in one of the Tower rooms of the India Gate. The bed was divine and I had a great sleep which is unusual for me in a strange bed. The history and pictures show a great social history of India, the afternoon tea looked Stunning. A couple of downsides - it took ages to get any warm water in the shower (and it was only ever warm not hot)  and the rooftop restaurant seemed closed when I visited;  No one about, dark etc but nothing to say so."
"The most beautiful & service oriented hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying at! The food, shopping, ambience and staff are All stellar! We stayed in the old historic wing of the hotel in a suite overlooking the Gateway to India. If for no other reason- this hotel alone will be my reason for returning to Mumbai. "
"This hotel is just WOW!!! Right from being greeted by the doormen to the traditional welcome by the service staff to the amazing palace service at the palace wing! The breakfast was amazing, room amazing, view amazing, service amazing! The concierge was also very obliging in arranging tickets for any shows we wanted to watch, collecting my altered outfit from a designer boutique, ensuring every recommendation they made for eateries took note of my allergies, leaving little gifts every time housekeeping was done. It was simply personalized service to a whole new level! I love this place and I'm going to keep returning to Mumbai only because I want to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace!!! Oh and did I mention I was pregnant and they were just so accommodating to all my needs!"
The entire experience right from check in to check out was truly top notch. My room was in the Palace wing with excellent decor and a brilliant view. One experiences royalty in this heritage hotel and their pleasant staff is genuinely interested in helpling/attending to you with a smile.   Simply Amazing !
"Felt Royal,we were upgraded to Palace side and was absolutely a wonderful experience.. Will return again for my husband to experience this as he was not able to accompany me the first time.Food was divine and we were able to ask the desk to order in some dishes from nearby eatery if you wanted to experience street food but in the safety of the hotel at night.Outside is chaos and dodgy not feel safe at night."
"This place was on our Bucket list for a while. We liked that a lot. Perfect architecture, perfect story, perfect picture in my mind. Very beautiful and amazing  building that was created so long time ago without high technology involved."
As soon as we arrived at the hotel we received first class service.  There was a lovely ambience to the reception and greeting area.  The staff were courteous and respectful and had friendly smiles throughout our stay.  Loved our room.  Keep up the good work.
"This is a truly outstanding hotel, with outstanding staff, and outstanding service. The food is excellent, the rooms excellent, the ambience, everything really, is just one notch above any other hotel we have stayed at. Plus there's beautiful art on the walls. Wonderful experience!"
"Me and my husband enjoyed five blissful days in this iconic 5 star dlx hotel. GM Taljindra's thoughtful packaged gifts boxes, jewelries & specially made 'MT. EVEREST 'chocolate cake really touched our heart."
"We stayed at The Taj Mahal Palace and could not have asked for a more perfect stay! It was just wow!!  From pick up at the airport, the hotel, staff, food and the amenities were second to none! Impeccable throughout. We absolutely loved the pool and outside area, the grass and gardens are beautifully maintained and the arrangement of flowers throughout the hotel are stunning  Our room was beautifully appointed, we opted for a Club room with sea views and had an incredible view of the Gateway of India  The Club option breakfast was delicious and dining area was stunning. The lounge area offered tea, coffee, snacks, afternoon tea, cocktails and brandy and chocolates in the evening! It was fantastic, the ambiance was occasionally lacking, so a touch of music would have created a"
"Every thing is excellent, the main extra advantage is this that whenever youwants open air cross the Road and here is Open Air and Ocean is waiting to welcome you with Taj. I always prefer Palace Wing whenever Night Stay in Mumbai with family and friends too. I am Travel Agent visited more then 21 Countries and location wise its coming on 2nd Number."
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel to celebrate anniversary of our friend. The experience was delightful and memorable. The staff were extremely courteous, everything was perfect.  Just the place to celebrate your special occasions. Used the Spa, Salon , pool and other amenities.  View from The Souk is breadth taking. Food was awesome.  A trip to remember"
"Best service,superb staff and good coopertion.The location is also very good.The shops inside the hotels are fantastic.Very beautiful and clean room with very goog Bathroom and the staff are very polite."
"A Royal experience..... The rooms are comfortable with hanging chandeliers, top range amenities, electric bidet and touches of comfort and luxury! Furnishings are comfortable and elegant which are appealing and overwhelming!"
"This property does not need to boast. It's style is matched by its exemplary service surrounded by an architectural marvel bringing together Moorish, Oriental and Florentine styles.  Our gaze is attracted like a magnet to the sea which surpasses panoramic. Glamour and style make a stay here mandatory.  The beds are heavenly as are the personal touches that give it a personal charm. The staff are engaging and helpful, making our stay like living in a palace, a home away from home... if you live in a palace, that is"
Superb from start to finish.  We only stayed for one night and stayed in the Heritage wing.  It was truly memorable and would recommend it to family and friends.  The High Tea was lovely and the free cocktails were very nice.
"All facilities and amenities were good and as per expectations, except emergency response required when we (around 15-16 persons) got stuck in lift (of capacity of 20 persons)...were taken out after 22 min thats too after several calls to receptions.....no body responded to lift alarms."
"We spent two night at the hotel as treat at the end of spending a month in India. From the moment we arrived until we left I would have to say it was one of the best Hotels I have stayed in with regards to service, eating options and overall experience. Words can not describe the opulence of this hotel. We were upgraded to the Palace section of the hotel which was a nice surprise. You are escorted to your room where they ensure you know how everything works in the room. The rooms a very comfortable. If you can afford the view ask for a room facing the Arabian Sea in the Palace. I know they have the same view from the Towers but you really need to be in the palace.  There are many restaurants to choose from, Indian, Chinese, Japanese or Eastern Mediterranean you can also get"
"Yet again I experienced a truly wonderful stay at this fabulous hotel. The Taj Mahal Palace really is a step above the competition in terms of location, heritage, luxury, staff attentiveness.   Breakfast , as always is such a relaxing experience, service and food excellent, nothing is too much for any of the staff at the Taj Mahal Palace. The room was nicely presented, situated in the right handside wing of the palace facing and overlooking the back of the hotel with a partial view of the swimming pool which was empty due to renovation work.  I stayed in room 381, I'd really like to be located on a higher floor next time to appreciate the view more. I highly recommend this hotel for travellers to Mumbai, an excellent base for exploring the south of the city. The only negative"
"Not for the first time in India, but very the first at Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Location is perfect – in the middle of the old Mumbai, within walking distances to the majority of the local attraction – Gateway to India, Old Post Office, University, Museum, Old Railway Station, Flora fountain, etc, etc. Just being in Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is attraction on its own. Old, but with everything what could be necessary today. Staff in old dresses give full picture of the Old India. Service, room, food and ambient are more than perfect. Interior is preserved from the old time, as much as possible, but with the modern touch. Something which everyone have to enjoy and appreciate. And, surprisingly not so expensive.  The best value for money which we ever had."
"We thought of booking Taj for our wedding night and during the booking, we looked for Tower wing as it was in good rate and also the room was good on higher floor sea facing. Few days before our arrival we just requested the hotel management to decorate the room and make it a bit special but they made sure to prove how high class and lovely the management is. They not just decorated the room with cake and flowers but they upgraded our room to Palace wing which was mind blowing and amazing. The hospitality was just wonderful and the staff is always polite. To sum it up, great stay and lovely experience!"
"Well, I am short of words to explain the memorable stay at The Taj Mahal Palace hotel Mumbai. Since childhood I have been watching this place and always wanted to have a stay and finally it happened. I stayed there with family for 2 nights over a weekend.   The place is just not a hotel but it's heritage and with a stay there you can feel that and become a small tiny part of that. The location is just the best you can find and any season is good to go there.   The welcome was great and check-in was smooth. It took few minutes for check-in but that gives you time to explore the lobby and have drinks. They gave us an upgrade to Luxury Club rooms in the heritage wing. It was a great surprise and we were overjoyed with that. The room was a sea and 'Gateway of India' facing room and"
We visited the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai and stayed at the Sea facing room in the Palace wing. The entire experience was extraordinary. The room was overlooking the Mumbai harbour and the iconic Gateway of India. The heritage tour of the hotel was something special wherein they took us around the entire hotel which is witness to the great history of India since 1903. The hotel is an excellent blend of heritage and modernity. To summarise... Wonderful and nostalgic experience
"The words are not enough to describe this amazing hotel. It has got spectacular views, luxurious interiors, amazing hospitality, India's first licensed bar. You can actually feel royal feelings at this place. And the best part is it's check in & check out ceremony, full of Indian traditions!"
A superb resort with a wonderful view of the gateway of India. The great service of taj. The impeccable food and the wonderful piano cafe. I loved the heritage look with a nice and wonderful staff making your stay memorable. 
"We arrived to be greeted by some wonderful staff who treated us  like royalty for the whole of our stay, they just could not do enough for you. This was truly an outstanding place to stay and they had thought of every little detail to make your stay memorable and special in every way. I wound highly recommend to stay at this beautiful hotel. Everything was just luxury. There are many memories made from our experience at the taj thank you "
"Stayed here for couple of nights on our recent trip to India. Taj lives up to it's name and everything provided is fine tuned and exceeds perfection. Lovely historic building with a touch of Raj, fine service with room with a view to die for.  This is in my list of one of the best hotels to stay and spend your savings :)"
"My wife and I visited this hotel on 24.6.17,in the evening at around 7.30 p.m., and went for food at MASALA KRAFT.The AMBIENCE is great, staff is excellent,courteous...but the  indian food which we ordered was awful,it was not tasteful at all,very less quantity and prices ,,,of course out of this world..mind shattering...it is not VALUE FOR MONEY AT ALL.IF you are visiting with your family, for having lunch or dinner,then strictly NO NO.There are better places for lunch or dinner,like Delhi darbar,Shahkari bhandar-a small canteen-,Leopold Cafe,Bade Miyan-for kababs and all kinds of  yummy kababs!"
Awesome customer service. Rooms were fabulous and definitely worth the money. Nice temperature controlled pool was perfect for an evening swim. Nothing to complain about. One should add this to the list of things to do (in India).
"Indian classic , reminiscent of many of the colonial buildings . Centrally located near both the gate of India and the train station in itself is a sight to see . Great restaurants here , sadly it's remembered by many for the attack on it several years back .  Take a look at the old photos of the famous prior guests going back 100 plus years amazing "
"There really should be a exponential number of stars because this place deserves it. Spent a night with my mum for her birthday - I was going to ignore the email that asks about your preferences but I went through the pages asking about pillows and reservations and decided to order a special chocolate tray for us to celebrate. At check in we got an upgrade to the palace wing, to a room full of balloons and a birthday pillow, cake and drinks delivered to the room, a visit from the Chef at Masala craft to ask if we were okay plus flowers and dessert at dinner and a set of incense fragrances for her to take back home.... I was simply blown away by everything.  There's a tour of the hotel that starts at 5:30 - it gives you such an appreciation on why the standards are maintained so"
"What a blast Mumbai is....an endlessly fascinating and dynamic city full of contrasts and surprises. This must be the most iconic place to stay whilst in Mumbai, it's location is brilliant and the view from our room was incredible. I was sorely tempted to book a room in the Palace wing and in hindsight made a good choice for not doing so as we spent long days out often with early rises and late returns whilst touring Mumbai. In short we saw little of the hotel and the extra luxuries the Palace Wing offers may have been wasted on me. The room/suite I booked was perfectly comfortable though, well presented, clean and had most amenities a modern traveller may require....if not then it is surely only a telephone call away. However for me the room itself was almost incidental as"
"This 115 year old hotel has its own charm and is beautiful. Very well maintained, and great warmth and hospitality by the team. Located very well and very scenic. Highly recommend the rooms facing the sea and the Gateway of India. "
"Nicely designed property with very prime location along with professional staffing and service. the quality of the food is also very good and the service of it gives the more and more comfort in it. but there was a problem in the allotment of the room by the staff because they had allotted the room on that area where some construction work is going on, which will disturb and wast my time me"
"We have stayed at many high-end hotels in Mumbai - ranging from the Four Seasons, Oberoi and Trident, but this is a very special place.  It clearly ticks all the boxes that a luxury hotel should be able to tick (and has simply an incredible location!) but what sets this Taj property apart is the fact that the staff all seem to act as if they own the hotel.  All the staff I engaged with have a incredible sense of pride about working at the Taj.  They help all each other at the drop of a hat, and the end product appears to be an incredibly well-run family-owned hotel.  In my many years of travelling, I have never come across this - not even at an Aman or Soho House hotel.    Congratulations to the team - also for the lovely new (since my last visit) breakfast area, it is lovely."
"A lovely old hotel, great location and views. The rooms were immaculate, old but not tired. The service is amazing, everyone goes out of their way to make your stay perfect. A thoroughly enjoyable, hassle free and luxurious stay. "
"From the hotel's sleek limo pick up at Mumbai airport, everything during our stay was wonderfully executed. Staff were courteous and helpful. We stayed in the palace wing and our room was overlooking the Gateway of India. The room was incredibly comfortable. The pool area was lovely as were all the restaurants within the hotel. The food served in all the places we ate was of an excellent standard, albeit it a little pricey but that is to be expected of a hotel of this calibre. We were on club level and this allowed us access to the Club Lounge which was a lovely area to sit and they had put on a lot of nice touches, including supper buffet, chocolate and brandy after dinner. A simple complaint was that you were not allowed to take any drinks out of this room which seemed a"
"The Taj Palace is the only hotel I visit during my trips to Mumbai. The service is impeccable, its décor classical and it is an oasis amongst the craziness of the city.  Only stay in the Palace Wing - the Suites are special.  The Tower wing isn't any different than your run of the mill standard hotel.  The hotel looks straight to The Gateway of India and the Indian Ocean - its quite breathtaking especially at sunrise and sunset.  There are many different restaurants on the property and the food in all are impeccable.  Book early for a phenomenal massage at the spa.  Highly recommend the scrub and massage.  The staff is kind, patient and incredibly helpful.  They make you feel at home and definitely feel that you do not want to leave.  It's quite a historic hotel, so please take"
"Taj Palace Mumbai made our golden wedding trip truly memorable, with flowers gifts balloons, a fantastic champagne brunch. We had the most beautiful room overlooking the Gateway to India. We adored every minute of this fabulous trip and cannot recommend this too highly - it is magical!"
You cannot expect any more !   Stayed in the iconic Taj Palace for a couple of days - Simply amazing. Staying in these lovely rooms that were built over a 100 years back is sheer joy. One cannot compare this property with any other hotel that has sprung up yesterday.    Resident Guests get complimentary access to the Palace Lounge which is another privilege you cannot ignore.  Worth coming to Mumbai to stay here !
"Wonderful historic building in crazy, busy, muggy Mumbai. Free upgrade to a palace room was lovely and staff were gracious and attentive. Elvis in the Chinese restaurant was a wonderful host! The pool area was lovely. I was excited to stay here and was not disappointed in the least. Don't think I could stay anywhere else in Mumbai"
"We had an excellent stay at the hotel all thanks to the wonderful staff at the Taj Mahal Palace. Right from the check-in guy to the house keeping staff, the Shamiana staff and the swimming pool staff, all were friendly and very helpful. The service levels are excellent which made our stay here for the family very memorable. Thanks all lot to the entire staff from us."
I think this is still the best hotel in Mumbai even after so many hotels have sprung up in the city. This is an iconic place. The old structure is awesome and looks very beautiful. The property boasts of the best restaurants in town. The view from the hotel over looking gateway of India cannot be missed. The hotel is very centrally located and right next to shopping and eating joints.
"Its a bucket list item. Visit the magnificent iconic TAJ @ Mumbai for its fabulous staff and property a mix of tradition, modernity, nostalgia and regale family moments. The TAJ walk in the evening is a path to glorious history and the GATEWAY of INDIA view reminiscence of  centuries old history."
Grand hotel and great experience. Awesome view from sea view rooms on third floor. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Bathroom amenities could be a bit better compared to other five star hotels.  Food quality is also very good.  Extremely great pickup/drop services.
"We find hotel very beautiful, environment is pleasant . Services are very good, traditional welcome, what else u need... located at a place where you can get every thing very near to hotel.  Overall experience is very good"
"Its one of those places which has history seeped into every stone of its. It has grown with changing times and every time I have stayed here or dined, i have come back delighted. They have mastered the art to delight its guest, and one must savour its hospitality if one can in their lifetime.  We went in for a staycation hoping for some quite R&R and had booked a suit in the new wing. To our delight, at our check-in , without having asked for an upgrade...team Taj had already upgraded us to the heritage tower wing..3notches higher. I offered my Taj membership card as courtesy for using my points for the upgrade given, they politely returned it saying its for your long standing association with Taj and did not charge it.   Too overwhelmed we asked for our luggage to be put in our"
Extremely Luxurious Stay; very friendly and courteous staff; nothing to complain about.  Breakfast was delicious and the Sea Lounge has an excellent view.  The welcome extended was royal.  High Tea at the Palace Lounge was really nice.
We stayed here for one night and we really enjoyed so much. It is the bestest hotel in the india.  The rooms are luxurious and have best staff members  This hotel is very famous in the india and the food was awesome  Must visit hotel in the mumbai
"I had the pleasure to spend a weekend in Mumbai and stayed at the Taj Mahal.  The hotel did not disappoint and met all the expectations friends and colleagues had set for my visit.   I got the customary greeting by name upon coming out of my airport car. I was taken to my room and checked in by the most pleasant service representative.  The hotel was beautiful, very clean and staff was very polite, friendly and accommodating. Quality of the room was high and all seemed in very good order. The restaurant was prompt and fully stocked. My highlight was the pool - lovely oasis in the middle of Mumbai madness. I even got a hotel gift or two or three. I enjoyed my stay. I suppose the only reason I am not rating the hotel with 5 stars is because friends had set expectations so high,"
"Stayed at Taj Mahal for 3 nights from 31 December to 2 January. It was our 2nd stay at this iconic hotel . Travelled with my wife and 2 kids aged 9 & 7 Previously spent New Year's 2014 here as well. Stayed at the Tower wing the last time and at the Palace wing this time round in a club room with executive lounge access. Was definitely better in the palace room, which had all the luxuries and access to the club lounge for breakfast, high tea and evening cocktails. Was definitely busier this time around with a lot more foreign tourists, nonetheless service was still excellent  Attended New Year's Eve part at hotel which was definitely enjoyed by the entire family though a bit pricey  A great hotel to which we will surely return "
"The Taj Mahal Palace, name says it all. It is the most beautiful and picturesque hotel which carries heritage as its Crown. Breakfast spread is amazing at The Sea Lounge or Shamiana, only area they could improve upon is in The Palace Lounge which served us Tea,somewhat Cold and that too without cookies 2 out of 3 times. "
"One of the most iconic hotel of Mumbai, and it is for reason. Brilliant service and experience. keep it up and Kudos to the entire team of the Taj Mahal Hotel. The staff is always on their toes and very helpful. The hotel has a wide variety of signature  restaurants which is a must try. Our favourite is Wasabi and Souk."
Nice Property..Amazing Location...Very Clean hotel...albeit more crowded with its own staff rather than the guests...Food needs attention as does the staff who have been trained by the superiors with the anecdotes of the British era about this property and they have become over proud thereby neglecting the needs of the guests....Taj senior management....It's time to Buck up!!!
"Taj Mahal Palace for sure gives you palacial feeling, unmatched Taj hospitality, warmth clubbed with amazing location makes it great hotel. Lovely view of Gateway of India and Sea from my room was superb. Superior food quality and taste were good too. we had wonderful experience. Restaurants and Bar are good too. The reception with painting by great M F Hussain is lovely. And needless to mention the historical Ball room has different aura altogether. Super locational positioning is added advantage. This hotel for sure is Class apart."
Outstanding hotel that lives up to the Taj standard. Exceptional service and food quality; they knew what we wanted/needed before we asked! Taxes inflate prices but this is not hotel's fault. Rooms and beds very comfortable. Highly recommended.
Extremely  comfortable  &  easy  accessible to  different  facilities available in  the hotel  & its  architect is  extremely  beautiful & its  lifetime   experience   to  live  with family & location  of the  hotel  at  historical  place  .
"I am really thankful to all the team members from Reception, Butler service, Room Service, Housekeeping etc in making my 10th Wedding Anniversary very special and giving us a warm welcome. I had really got the best things arranged for my entire stay.  There is no doubt about their services and the way they handle all Guest, Taj Mahal Place is one of the best Hotels in the world and proud to be member for Taj Epicure and a Citizen of Inida, Mumbai where it is situated.  Keep it up TAJ , i am with you.  Regards,  Tushar"
"I actually do not have words to describe the hotel and the services provided. Highlights are : 1) most courteous staff 2) perfect ambiance and comfort 3) perfect place for family, couple, business trips or any other reason on the earth 4) Grand"
Its really Palace Residence and friendly in nature and I enjoyed like anything. We will have all future stay at Taj only. I will recommend to my friends and relatives without any second thought.  Again Taj is Taj.
"A beautiful old hotel that is modern and very comfortable inside.  The attention and assistance from the house staff is so good it is almost embarrassing.  The rooms are immaculate and the staff really care for their work. The hotel is a luxurious oasis to get you away from the heat, the smells and the bustle outside. My old concern was the often nonchalant attitude of the security staff at the front entrance.  Given the history of the hotel I would have thought it would be more professional."
"We highly recommend the rooftop restaurant at The Taj Mahal Palace. After visiting the Gateway of India we stopped here for some lunch and chose the a la carte menu. The mozeralla and spinach pastry cigarettes and hummus were fantastic. Customer service was outstanding too. Great views, lovely atmosphere."
I booked a room for my parents on their 40th anniversary and it was one of the best gift I have ever given to parents. They were very happy and they said me that the hotel is out standing and the staff of the hotel was very polite and my parents can't speak English still the staff was very polite and everyone was speaking Hindi with my parents in the end my parents said me this was heaven for them.  So my parents loved it. It's a awesome place. If anyone yourself Taj Mahal palace is the best place. Thanks a lot to Taj people and a very special thanks to Satish sir.....
Was there for a Business Conference/Seminar. The seminar was organized in the taj mahal palace-Crystal Room. Great Infrastructure and Service. Good Ambience and Proper resources anfd facilities were provided.
I attended a Asia Pacific Conference which was held at this hotel where many guests and colleagues were staying at the hotel for the whole week.  The service is unparalleled to any other hotel i have stayed at. The personalized attention was most welcoming. There were many interesting rituals that the staff carried out across the hotel. From lighting lamps to placing special gifts in the room with special customized messages. The staff too were attentive and constantly checked on our needs.  The hotel itself has a lot of historic significance and it's a very comfortable and grand hotel. Rooms were comfortable and elegantly designed.  We used the business center services and that too was of high standards.  I will always consider selecting this hotel to stay at again.
Great Property/ Super Service and a fantastic experience of the Taj Heritage.The property is like a mini heritage city with suck beautiful architecture and artifacts . A very High end feeling and unparalleled service.
"GREAT hopitalities during stay, we are truly touched by gestures of all departments to make our occassion of 35 years of marriage, even more special and memorable, FROM 1983-2017 & BEYOND, TAJ always!! rajivsima.."
"I have stayed several times from 2005 to 2010 and have always been a gratifying experience in all aspects. Efficiency, security, courtesy, professionalism. Great restaurants and one of the most beautiful views of Mumbai, especially in the evening. Taj hotels are safe for people like me who stayed longer in India, one of the most welcoming countries in the world. Congratulations and see you as soon as possible."
"I had heard so much about this place before travelling. The expectations were massive. I was not disappointed.   From the customised fondue, to the incredible swimming pool and spa, everything was just incredible."
The hotel gives u an experience that you will never forget ..... The property is mind blowing and a truly a place to must visit if in Mumbaiii.... The food is really amazing and the new coffee shop is fabulous.....  
"Dropped in to meet a friend and waited at the reception. While waiting there for him to come down, I took in the surroundings and was  amazed by the Splendour. Must check in someday to experience the hospitality. "
"We started a cruise in Mumbai and from the beginning of my planning, I knew we had to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace.   We were not disappointed.  I arranged for a transfer from the airport to the Hotel through the Taj Concierge as our flight was arriving at near midnight.   The transfer was included in our Club Level room reservation.   And after 25 hours of travel, I didn't want any headaches.   And none were to be had - at all!  As soon as we stepped out of customs, there was a Taj representative holding a sign.   After then checked our names, we were immediately relieved of our luggage and whisked to a waiting vehicle.  We were placed in the back seat with the AC on high while they loaded our luggage and then a liveried, white gloved driver drove us the approx. one hour to the"
"Awesome experience.  The Taj Palace is the best art museum in India.  You can spend an entire day just gazing at the paintings, art objects, and furniture collection exhibited all over the hotel.  The room was very comfortable and nice.  And the value was extra-ordinary."
"Having stayed at most of the properties across the Taj Hotel chain, each time we stay at the Taj Mahal we get to see another dimension of the Jewel in the Taj Hotel Crown. Thanks a ton for making our 10th Anniversary so special."
Room was very good  and clean to the highest quality Qaulity of linen is very good.Service is very good.View of the room is very good .Security is very good.Food is very good.what ever you can think it is there
"We had booked a Superior Room at the Towers to celebrate a special occassion.Upon arrival,Mr.Rahil at the Front Desk upgraded us to a Club category room in the Heritage wing.This came with a host of additional facilities & we were totally floored.Taj service,which is impeccable,surpassed our expectations yet again!The Palace wing is undoubtedly the most  beautiful & luxurious place to stay in all of Mumbai."
Stayed in the heritage wing which is absolutely heritage luxury .Taj service standards are the best in the industry . My 1st prefrence is always Taj hotel because of there professional services & makes you feel very comfortable with every service requirements are fulfilled with the drop of a hat. Loved the property .
"Worth the money , even at the going rate. It is a superb experience in India and  for me one of the worlds best hotels. Service quality and the food in the different restaurants are hard to match. The interior is splendid and the staircase in the old wing invites you to at least walk down to enjoy the beauty."
"A beautiful, magnificent hotel located near the picturesque Gateway of India. We were given an upgrade and it was an Oh-so-lovely room with a splendid view of the city and Gateway of India. We stayed in the Luxury grande room and the room was exquisite and had a marble bathroom with an amazing spacious bath tub. The interiors of the Hotel are beautiful and majestic. The service is impeccable. The staff is really attentive, prompt and kind. Special thanks to Priyanka, Natasha and Ramesh from the front desk."
"I stayed in the Tower wing, which is modern and less expensive, actually very reasonable. The well appointed room came with great bathroom products, wifi, parking and breakfast.  The breakfast was a wonderful buffet in a lovely room with a view of the sea. There were western and Indian specialties. The bed was very comfortable. There were dogs baking all night, despite being 11 floors up. There was a balcony, but it was too humid to enjoy, plus it is screened in. I definitely recommend a haircut at the salon. It was wonderful, came with a head massage, all about $13."
"Extra ordinary interiors ,  World class service from check in to out , reasonable prices compare to international market , access to shopping and key business areas in Mumbai  upgraded with high security"
"heaven like experience in ""THE TAJ"". it has gorgeous look with traditional approach of tatas, service is top class, helping staff, interior is too good, food is excellent, purely indian touch and look"
"The main advantage of the hotel is the location, right opposite Gateway of India and the history.  The service was excellent.  The property is extremely clean and well maintained.  The pool and gym are very well kept and not crowded.  Breakfast spread was adequate, I asked for a paratha, which was made fresh and served, even though it was not on the buffet.  The Breakfast experience was made special by Sanjay who looked after us very well and understood our preferences."
I grew up in the suburbs of Mumbai and was always fascinated with this hotel. Its majestic location near the Gateway is a memory lot of Mumbaikars associate this city with. Upon arrival we were upgraded to the palace wing of the hotel and boy we enjoyed it.The rooms are exquisite and the service impeccable. Variety of food options in the hotel. In the evening we were surprised to a warm bubble bath preparation and the room decorated with balloons. The staff here goes out of the way to treat their guests. One of the top rated hotels I ever stayed in. Period.
"From check in, to check out, the Taj provided an unparalleled experience.  The staff were excellent. The room magnificent. Very well appointed.  The Indian restaurant, Masala Kraft, was marvellous with very attentive staff, and I enjoyed a quick chat with the chef.  Enjoyed drinks at both the Harbour Bar and Sea Lounge. A 1933 cocktail (from memory) was quite an experience in the Harbour Bar, and it was a very nice drink as well. The location is tremendous and the hotel provides a car and driver (at cost) for tours and this was also excellent.  There is a nice memorial following the 2008 terrorist, and the hotel's security current precautions are understandable.  There is a good gym tucked away next to the Spa. Thank you very much."
We generally stay at Taj hotels when in India -- the Mumbai property is absolutely fantastic --  the service is impeccable.  The location is perfect with views out over the ocean   Try to get a room in the older part of the hotel if you can
"The best hotel I've ever stayed in. Impeccable service, outstanding breakfast, best room EVER (and I got an upgrade upon arrival). Also I don't know what room spray they use but it is heavenly. Best stay of my entire life, couldn't recommend enough."
"even though i live in mumbai, a stay at TAJ or even if me n my husband has to dine there has always been an amazing exp.  the staff is extremely humble n helpful.  you feel as if someone has taken you back in time with its beautiful decor n ambience.  worth ever penny."
From the moment you walk in you are treated amazingly well. The staff are extremely helpful. The service staff were kind and attentive and extremely polite. The breakfast in the Sea Lounge is excellent with ample options for any taste. The hotel is well presented with plenty of international options for dining in the hotel. The rooms were well presented and comfortable. The hotel was happy to accommodate a late checkout and I would gladly come back anytime.
"It was from my bucket list to go to The Taj Mahal Palace from childhood - i have always seen Taj hotel from standing at Gateway of India.  Taj hotel consists of 7-8 restaurants inside it - Chinese cuisine , Masala craft , Shamiana ,   Being a Vegetarian - we have decided to go to Shamiana restaurant. We took Pav Bhaji , Garlic Butter Naan , Paneer Butter Masala - it costed us something about 2500+ Rs. Ambiance was very nice ,Good serving qty , cool ... also service was good -  We even took few pastries from La Patesserio bakery of Taj.  It was a nice evening / dinner at Taj"
"Staying in this hotel was like a dream come true for me, as for me its one of the finest hotels India has. It holds a lot of heritage value and also its a symbol of Mumbai's undying spirit for me, after the blasts, it still stands tall with all its prime. I stayed at the 19th floor of the hotel, with my balcony overlooking the Gate of India, and the sea. The view from my balcony especially early in the morning was simply amazing, with so many boats parked, a new life waiting to begin. The hotel is equipped with all world class amenities and the hospitality is outstanding. The food at the hotel is also of top class quality whether you order room service or dine at any of the restaurants. This is one hotel I always look upto visiting again."
"We spent 3 gorgeous nights in the palace. This place is even better than we expected it to be, starting with the room, the lobby and all hotel facilities. Service is extraordinary, wherever you go you'll find only immaculate environment, warm hospitality and sincere urge to serve and to please. We loved it!!"
"Don't even think twice, just go ahead and enjoy the Taj Experience. The best Taj experience with heritage of India and a royal experience. a must for Bucket list. The perfect vacation for anyone who loves to live life in the moment."
Fantastic hotel well located and high quality facilities.  The service and the waiters are kindness and majour part of them with english level high standards.  The breakfast and the food has a lot of variety and excellent.
This was the first time I had the opportunity to experience the accommodation at the Taj Palace Hotel in Mumbai. Everything about the Taj Palace is five star. They make you feel special all the time.  From check in to check out life is special for the guests of the Taj.
"Taj Mahal is the best hotel in India, The location, the hotel itself, the amenities, the food & all the people who make the experience truly unforgettable every time a guest stays there.  This hotel is definitely amongst the best in the world."
"I stayed three nights and felt totally at home in this hotel, all the staff could not do enough to make your stay enjoyable and relaxing, the level of comfort in the rooms is top notch, excellent swimming pool area and when you come down for breakfast on the second morning and they know who you are and the room number, you know you are in a hotel which takes attention to detail to a high standard. I liked this hotel, well located for sights."
"This place gives you the best experience you can have. They provide personalized services tailored to your age group, specific personal needs and taste. Provides multiple options for food and shopping. Simply Amazing."
"Coddled and pampered like a king! Our two days of leisure visit will be in our loving memories all our life… right from the warm welcome at the reception with tulsi beads to the good luck charm during our check out. Every moment was wrapped with warmth, care and marvelous hospitality! Thank you so much… we are overwhelmed."
"Stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel while in Mumbai and had a wonderful experience. Old world charm coupled with all the modern conveniences, great food, service and atmosphere. I would recommend this hotel anytime."
"If you would like to be treated like royalty fro beginning to end, we highly recommend experiencing The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai! Nothing is to much trouble! The food is amazing!  The staff are on hand for your every need The cleanliness is impeccable"
We booked into the Taj Mahal Palace as we are staying in India for 6 months due to work and this hotel has always been on my wife's bucket list since she qualified as a chef and hotel manager. We only stayed for one night but from start to finish the experience was nothing short of incredible. It was a special occasion which I had informed the hotel of and the housekeeping staff made the extra effort to decorate our room with balloons and flowers. Small touches but very unexpected. I would wholeheartedly recommend that anyone who has the opportunity to visit Mumbal stays at the Taj and that they have a good look around the hotel and take in all of the culture and history that is on display.
A wonderful place to stay. I was treated like royalty when I stayed here. The room I had was spotless and very quite. It was a bit expensive but well worth it when staying in this dirty city. Mumbai is a brilliant city full of energy and sleaze. It was great to come back to my wonderful room after a spending the day in a chaotic city environment such as Mumbai. I recommend this hotel to anyone willing to splurge a few extra sterling for the night. Cheers.
Taj Mahal Hotel continues to provide superlative experience of hotel stay in Mumbai. My wife and I stayed in the Palace wing and were very happy with all services from check to check out. Our room was in excellent shape and food and service at the Sea Lounge out of this world. Service and food at Shamiana was also very good.
Its always a great pleasure to stay at Taj Mahal Mumbai. Extra ordinary royalty treatment and best of the class services. Room was also well done. Location is the best to stay in mumbai with best of the cafe's around.
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai is the best - best property in India. The service is perfect. Amenities mainly the Salon and Swimming Pool are excellent. The Salon Services are excellent. To celebrate a special occasion one must visit this property. It is perfect in all respect."
"What a place , and above all Hospitality , undoubtedly best in the segment, ask for sea view room specially if you are staying in Tower.  Do not forget to visit Shamiyana ! Just awesome ...And Memorable "
"This is my third stay in this hotel, and the best experience ever. The Taj is aging, but very gracefully and getting better at its services. Fabulous services, comfortable rooms, excellent amenities and choice of restaurants."
Writing this review from my hotel room. We had plans to extend our stay but not after this experience. I am very disappointed with some staff handling the cars at the entrance and the duty manager at the front desk. I found them to be arrogant and not interested.They also do not maintain a complain register and hence handed me a blank sheet of paper to address my grievences without asking me my room number because he hardly cared about my complain. Very poor Taj Mahal Palace hotel. 
"Having visited the iconic Taj hotel on every visit to Mumbai since my first 20+ years ago, I finally had the pleasure of staying there, and can reaffirm that it is truly the 'grand dame' of Indian hotels!  My soon-to-be fiancee was moved to tears when she walked in to the lobby (it was also her first trip to India), and from the garlanded welcome to our check out, everything and everyone was faultless.  We stayed in the historic Palace Wing, and were generously upgraded to the Taj Club rooms, giving us access to the beautiful Palace Lounge where we enjoyed complimentary afternoon tea, cocktails before dinner and post-dinner cognac and chocolates.  Rooms: our room was tastefully decorated, and the beautiful marble bathrooms added to the old world charm.  Food: breakfasts in the"
include breakfast and dinner in membership.only word i can use for all ur services is EXCELLENT.IF possible pl keep acquaaerobics trainer.  pl keep our good old indian recipes in launch or dinner so that foreigners know about our traditions
"It was my visit to Mumbai after around 30 years and Taj Mahal Palace made it extremely special, was well taken care and  overwhelmed with view ,staffs, rituals, smile which you can experience during your stay. Was immersed in the bygone era and lived the history while taking the heritage walk. Don't miss the documentary on "" The Taj of Apollo Bunder""."
"Had a night here and was expecting exceptional service and quality, it was OK but have experienced better.   This hotel is world famous, yet the service was slow, food came out at different times and even forgot 2 of the main courses."
"This is a first class top notch hotel with outstanding service in every way possible.  The staff is exquisite, professional, accommodating - PERFECT in every way.  Food was good. Our room in the Palace was elegant and the housekeeping delivered perfection.  We tipped and tipped and tipped... the service was incessant."
"I don't know how to quite put into words how amazing the taj is! On check in we were greeted like we were family , with beautiful gifts of garlands and drinks. We were upgraded to palace wing , and very rarely in life will we have wow moments , but this was the time ! The palace wing is steeped in history and memorabilia with pictures of past and present celebs and royals that have graced the magnificence of this hotel . Additionally they offer a guided tour of the hotel with a well informed guide . The hotel staff are without a doubt the most professional and informed staff in the world and take huge pride in their hotel and what the taj offers. A huge thank you to sayonika das who is a front office executive who ensured throughout our entire stay everything was beyond perfect"
"The hotel itself is bringing you back into time and is very authentic. Every person in the hotel staff wears traditional clothing and even the baskets by security are wrapped in red velvet. Attention to detail is very high here. Candles carved into the shape of roses, flowers everywhere and some changed daily the centerpieces in the palace entrance are changed weekly.  We stayed in the palace and had an amazing view of the Gateway of India. This was great because we got to do a timelapse and see the icon of Bombay every single day all day.  The room itself is outdated but this is what you should expect, it's a traditional hotel and there is no modern anything here. The outlets had a built in converter which was great.  The hotel is near the Colaba Causeway and you must remain"
"The Taj Mahal looked impressive and lived up to all our expectations.  Staff was extremely friendly, interior restaurants was wonderful and our first experience of Mumbai overall was great.  We hired a guide through the hotel to show us  around for the two days we were there. Her knowledge of the area and local sights saved us time and effort.  I cant speak highly enough of the hotel, just beautiful"
"Plenty to like for lovers of some colonial charm. Lots of features from a by gone era here with art deco style lobby and bars coupled with excellent service. That said, somehow also felt like the place is past its best. The surrounding area is getting left behind by the more modern parts of the city. Having once been the business hotel of choice the place increasingly caters for tourist groups. "
"Whatever I write about the Taj Mahal Palace wouldn't do it justice because it is beyond superb.  We stayed for 5 nights and I would have preferred 25 nights.  It was absolutely outstanding from the moment we arrived, our room, the Butler Service, the staff in the bars, by the pool, in the restaurants, and the Managers - all absolutely committed to giving the very best service.  We've stayed at hotels such as Raffles [Singapore], The Peninsula [Hong Kong], to name just two and the Taj beats everything we've seen so far in our lives.  The staff are dedicated, smart, professional, engaging, and really mean it when they are pleased to help.  The standard of food prepared by the Chefs is outstanding and there was such a vast choice it is difficult to know where to start.  Breakfast"
"Unfortunately We were not able to stay at the Taj as only in Mumbai for a day whilst on a cruise, but popped in for some R&R. What a beautiful hotel. The exterior is a wonderful expression of Mughal architecture and inside the hotel is an oasis of calm and quietness.  Enter through the new security area at the right side near the Tower building. If the residents areas of the hotel are like the reception, lounge and retail areas then this must be a wonderful place to experience as a staying guest.  The view of the Gateway to India from the top floor restaurant was fabulous."
"We visited the taj next to gateway of India after a game of golf in the hot Mumbai sun. Beautiful hotel. Had afternoon tea including sandwiches. Superb service. Good food. The place to see and be seen in Mumbai. The staff very professional. When my wife inquired about a availability of a drink the reply was "" ma'am even if it's not in the menu we will somehow get it for you"" . The answer thrilled us. And we did get the special lassi she liked."
"we are stay for a business trip,Airport to this hotel takes 60 mints very near to gate way of India,behinds  the hotel local  Shoping area also on waking  5 min,very Good Service,good Location ,Excellent room cleanliness...etc"
"Hotel itself consider as landmark. Iconic hotel in front of in front of Mumbai. Hyper quality service. The dinning option inside hotel are great but if want to feel the local experience, the options around the hotel are countless as you will are downtown in Mumbai."
Had a fantastic experience of staying at Taj Mahal Hotel. The entire experience from check-in to check-out was nice with unique elements that are unparalleled in the hospitality industry. The room was nice and overlooking the Gateway of India.
"The first thing is the location, the other is comfort and the luxury. The hotel has heritage value in the old wing and new age comfort in the adjoining section. The place offers great efficiencies in terms of eating options, the stay and the Taj Hospitality."
Have visited this place last month. From outside you will think of it as a old hotel building. But when you visit inside the level of luxury they offer is apart from any other hotel i have visited in Mumbai. People here are friendly. Housekeeping and other staff welcome you with smile every time. They truly make you feel like home.
"We checked in to this hotel on 29th May 2017. Right from checking in time, the hotel staff made sure hat we felt totally welcome and cared for. The front desk staff walked us to our room and gave us a mini tour of the hotel. We loved the ambience of the staircase, the walkways, the rooms. Everything was just Out of this world.  My kids found the bath tub very exciting. They just loved soaking around all day. The swimming pool was indoor heated, with a temperature setting. The pool water was crystal clear and refreshing. It was a great experience swimming. The gym was very complete with good trainers and excellent facilities.  The food at the restaurant was outstanding. The room has facilities for tea coffee etc in the room. Everything was just world class.  The evening ritual of"
"I did not enjoy my time here. The Glorious setting, historical location and glossy menus did nothing for me when the service was genuinely sad. I almost felt as though I was resented as being a guest despite staying in the Palace section in a suite. Butler service did not help me at all. I was very disappointed"
"This was my first  stay at Taj palace. I had stayed at various Taj properties, but staying at Taj palace just stands out. Everything was so meticulous, down to its finest details. We stayed at hotel to celebrate our marriage anniversary and hotel staff made us feel so welcomed, arranged a cake, flower bouquet and decorated our room.   Thank you so much Taj palace folks for making the occasion so special for my family."
"Being a resident of Mumbai, I have frequently visited the Taj Mahal Hotel, Colaba; this was my first stay at their flagship hotel. Taj group of hotels is not just about luxury, it is about the warmth & hospitality. Every member is a team player and ensuring the comfort and satisfaction of the guest is each & everyone's mission. This stay was no exception the their rule.  We stayed in the Tower Wing in a sea facing room. There is renovation work on at the hotel presently and therefore the room is noisy from 9 am - 7 pm.  The room we stayed in is recently renovated. It is very comfortable. Turn down service is available. The swimming pool is 33 mts in length. Sunny, spacious & green. It is peaceful within, but it has a busy street on the other side of the wall, which brings the"
+ One of the best selection of restaurants in a city hotel + Well-kept rooms in the palace wing with a view of the Gateway of India + Signature service that are attentive and prompt at every level + Great location for walking around
"Stay can't be better than staying at the Taj Mahal hotel. The hotel is a heritage site but along with it the service carries the flair of Indian heritage with a touch of class.  The food is awesome, especially the tiffin menu at Masala Mix. Quiet sufficient for two provided one doesn't have a large appetite."
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel 28-31 May 2017 for my wife's birthday.  From the minute we arrived we were treated like royalty. The hotel is spotlessly clean, well maintained and has the feel of long gone colonial charm. A real gem. We were upgraded to the Heritage part of the hotel and the staff had arranged flowers/ balloons and a birthday cake for my wife in our room on arrival.  We had dinner in 3 of the hotel restaurants and each was superb.  Not the cheapest, but good value for the quality of service and food.  Breakfast in the Sea Lounge is well worth taking your time over and definately not to be rushed.  The daily hotel guided tour is well worth booking (it's free) and it was lovely to window shop in the many high end stores in the hotel.  I  thoroughly commend"
"This is the second time that we have stayed at the Taj and this time was even better.  Because of an early flight from Sri Lanka our Palace Room was not available.  We were taken to the lounge and offered some free drinks while we were waiting.  After a short wait we were then informed we had been upgraded to a Taj Club Room which was superb.  Everything about the room was perfect and it was just a pity we were there for only two days. The breakfast is excellent as is the High Tea, if you choose to have this. The only issue we had was the cost of food and drink in the bars and restaurant's.  After spending time in India and Sri Lanka the cost is a shock to the system. One of the best things was La Patisserie which is in the shopping precinct on the ground floor.  The cakes and"
Located in Colaba in close vicinity of Gateway of India right in front of the Arabian Sea is this Hotel Taj Mahal Palace which is epitome of luxury & sophistication. The rooms are of various categories but if you can afford Club Class in the Palace facing the Gateway of India or Arabian Sea are to be preferred.

"Its elegant, its beautiful and its one experience you must get. I got sea-facing room, the view was amazing, the rooms were clean, spacious and well maintained. I liked the staff, they were very courteous and helpful."
One of the most beautiful hotel in Mumbai which is near to C and which has pretty Rooms with a good service. To enjoy the opportunity of life you have to come in. February is a great month in Mumbai to spend your holidays
"You cant explain how special the hotel is, old world glamour and so much history.  We stayed in a club room which was fantastic, definitely worth the extra expense if you can afford, for the  sun downers and use of the club lounge. Pool lovely and tranquil, compared to the chaos of Mumbai outside, no problem getting a sunbed. The staff were fantastic too, and very accommodating at trying to check us in early when we arrived early and tired from our journey. My only comment would be that the food (aside from breakfast which was brilliant) in the restaurants was slightly disappointing and very expensive for what it was so when I stay again I will probably choose to eat elsewhere. Looking forward to re-visiting this Christmas time. :)"
I always wanted to stay in taj mahal palace and in december I get a chance to stay in this hotel due to hdfc regalia card hotel voucher. I had a amazing experience and first time in life i feel how vip i am
"By far the most unbelievable hotel in the world. It far outweighs any other experience I have had from the hundreds of hotels I have visited. Every single member of staff is smart, smiley and informative - not to mention really well dressed!   Speedy and friendly check in, the most helpful and kind waiters at breakfast (Sujit and Shankar at breakfast are awesome!), small touches by housekeeping in rooms, for example I sense sticks and rose petals - they have thought of everything and left no stone unturned!   I really don't think words can fully describe the memories that this stay has left us with - we can't wait to return as I'm sure this hotel is guaranteed to do nothing but please!   Thank you so much to all the staff! "
"I have thought long and hard about my experiences with this hotel and I have to follow my initial disappointments which I will come to but I do have to praise the staff and management for their response and reaction to these.  We booked a sea view room on an upper floor in the old part of the hotel overlooking India Gate and that is indeed what we had and the room was fantastic. We had been looking forward to coming here because of the history of the hotel.  My first disappointment was that everybody books into reception which is in the Tower wing. There is no feeling of the heritage part of the hotel, indeed it could just have well been a Hilton or similar. You are then lead along a corridor and up in a lift and you arrive on the fourth floor, in our case, of the Heritage wing."
"I had not stayed in the old wing of The Taj for years. It is truly a fabulous experience. The room did smell a little musty (what didn't in Mumbai, after a massive rain a few days earlier) and the bed was a bit hard for my liking, but I would hardly complain. The place oozes splendour, the staff are absolutely wonderful. Not to be missed is breakfast in the Sea Lounge. Ask for a window seat so you can gaze out on to the Gateway of India. Lunch under the giant ceiling fans on the terrace by the pool. You won't want to leave!"
"My visit to TAJ was a royal & awesome finest experience of my life. The service from the arrival till the departure & all through the stay cannot be expressed by the words, keep up the good work TAJ, i will highly recommend visitors to mumbai to come & experience the TAJNESS...."
"I booked the cheapest room in the tower wing just to stay at the Taj but upon arrival discovered that they gave me a nice room in the heritage (fancy) wing without any explanation. I was pleasantly surprised and did not complain. Service is exquisite, every Taj employee you see is willing to help. They learned my name and called me by my name even though I only stayed 3 days. I would highly recommend staying there just for the experience."
"Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is ""the"" location to stay in Mumbai. We stayed 4 nights and had a superb experience. The staff were very attentive, accommodating and all the Hotel  restaurants were great. We enjoyed the views from our room overlooking the Gateway  of India from the palace wing."
"I traveled to the Taj Mahal Palace from the UAE with two friends for a long weekend. We were thrilled (and surprised) to be upgraded to suites, all of which were unique but equally beautiful. The upgrade to a suite only only added to my overall positive experience. The staff were attentive and professional, the environment (from the paintings in the corridors to the flower arrangements in the lobby) was inviting and elegant, and the location of the hotel was perfect. The little touches in the room - from the rose petal foot bath to the sleeping sprays and lotions - were additions that made the experience unique to the Taj. We also used hotel cars for several excursions and found all of the drivers to be incredibly kind, knowledgeable and helpful. Wonderful customer service!"
Service is very good. Parking Facility is also available. The Place or Location where this Hotel is situated is just awesome. Further they are providing with all types of amenities. It was an amazing experience.
Stay at the prestigious heritage wing of Taj Mahal Palace hotel is an experience which cannot be described in words. It takes you back by a century with its Victorian style room and its furniture. The rooms spread over six floors are maintained in such impeccable style that you feel you are in different country at a different time. Each floor has exclusive butler service in addition to a well appointed room and stocked bar. Complimentary refreshments are served at the ground floor lobby and breakfast at the Sea lounge on the first floor. The most amazing part of the heritage wing is its long beautiful corridors with vintage furniture . A must visit for any discerning traveler. You may not always get accommodated in this wing as it is generally full.  A prior request is essential.
"We had a great time celebrating our special occasion with the Taj Colaba. The service, food and rooms were all excellent. The facilities and amenities were up to our expectations. We shall like to come and stay again!"
"We visited this hotel during my stay in mumbai in the months of April ... On entry through its grand reception it was like a feeling of some thing Very royal ...it has a huge reception and it looks like a big arena .... We stayed in Palace wing and our room was facing the gate way of India .... The room was quite luxurious  For people staying in taj , drinks are free at Palace Lounge located at ground floor  We are at sea lounge and shamiana the food was awesome OK_hand It has a 1933 old bar known as Harbour bar .... I had very famous cocktail there known was "" from the Harbour since 1933 "" and bombay blazer ...  Very very royal hotel ... "
"This was our second visit to this wonderful hotel, we stayed in late April and this time we brought my sister and her husband along who, like us, absolutely loved every minute of their stay. The hotel is situated in a great location, food is fantastic, the pool area is just beautiful. Our favourite part was having breakfast in the Sea Lounge, the morning sun beaming in the windows and glistening down on the sea. It's truly a special hotel. The staff are so friendly and knowledgeable."
"Wonderful stay, gracious staff, great pampering.   Our room got upgraded and it was well decorated for our anniversary stay. The staff made sure we had a good time.   The Hotel and its heritage is beautiful. Its definitely a special place to be. Etched in our memory."
I strongly recommend to stay as i think its one of the best experience in the hotel offering a diversified view of Colaba.   Staff is excellent - pool is super and the stay really helps you retrospect and slow down a bit in Mumbai fast life...
"For years we have read and heard about the majesty of this hotel and to finally experience it was a peak experience .  There is no need to repeat all the praises that others have written, It is a living work of art and history.  Some suggestions, however, if you are lucky enough to stay here: 1) Definitely stay in the Palace section rather than the newer addition to fully immerse yourself in its splendor; 2) enjoy the outdoor pool andeat at the grill while you are there---the grilled giant shrimp are fantastic; 3) ask for the room on the second floor in the south east corner that overlooks the India Gate for wonderful people watching and perhaps the occasional concert; 4) enjoy a massage at the spa--rather reasonably priced for such an otherwise pricy hotel."
"After watching several documentaries, reading lots of reviews, watching YouTube videos and having visited the hotel as a child, it was always on mine and my Mum's bucket list to visit the famous Taj Hotel and always been our dream to stay and experience the hotel.   I had already booked to stay in Goa for a week to meet my Mum who was there for three weeks. I wanted to surprise her and take her away on her actual birthday so booked one night at the Taj. I looked on several sites and found a really good price which included breakfast. She still didn't know we were going to stay there. I liaised back and forth with the hotel and they requested a photo of us (more to come.)  We flew from Goa with Air India and arrived in the morning into Mumbai. There was a representative waiting"
"The Taj Mahal hotel in Colaba is a great place if you want to stay in the city of Mumbai. Good large spacious rooms, delicious food, very courteous service gives you a super experience only at the TAJ. The harbour bar and Golden Dragon have amazing drinks and food respectively. Shamiana is a great place to catch up with friends. Worth returning again and again. Its one of the best hotels in the world."
This resort can literally make you realize how hospitality is the be explained. This resort defines the reason why taj hospitality is world renowned. Right from the heritage rooms to the food here is simply perfect. The piano cafe is breathtaking with the scenic view and the wonderful cup of tea with it. The staff here are genourously good and the food here is simply delicious. A must visit in a life time. 
"Its privilege to stay at Taj, the staff will not give you reason to make complaint, excellent food and service, pleasant atmosphere great location. I stayed for 2 nights and looking to visit again soon."
"Astonishing architecture, unbelievable views and historical elements. If you find yourself enjoying a cup of tea in the garden of this hotel , you can truly say the life is worth living :)  . A true time travel back to colonial India. A documentary, first person revelation of the extraordinary  history of this magnificent structure and it's guests ( available in every room ) is a must see."
"Our second stay at the Taj. Excellent room and general facilities. Amazing building and location. Great team to look after you. Good food and drink. Highly recommended for a palatial experience, whilst exploring a fascinating city."
We visited last year at this hotel for 2 nights and were awestruck by its grandeur. The breakfast spread is vast and amazing. The swimming pool is good along with the spa. It has its old worldly charm more of British era. Good experience. But is mighty expensive!! 
"Stayed here for five nights on a business trip.  Possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  The greeting upon arrival- the blessing, service, breakfast and yoga by the pool - this is simply paradise.  Turndown service is outstanding - rose petal foot spa.  Next time I am in Mumbai I hope it is for pleasure and I will definitely being staying at the Taj!"
"We enjoyed a wonderful 4 night stay at this beautiful hotel during May '17. The accommodation is of a high standard, the staff are very helpful and generally the hotel provides all the attributes you should expect from a true 5* hotel, we can thoroughly recommend to anyone."
"The Taj Mahal Palace combines an excellent location, personalized service, sumptuous rooms, and a strong sense of place to create an indelible whole.  This is a hotel with character, and staying here will help define your stay in Mumbai.  Location and security:  The hotel is on the Colaba waterfront in South Mumbai, about an hour's drive from the airport, and convenient to museums, shopping, restaurants, and the historic Fort district, which has a great deal of vintage Raj architecture.  The property overlooks the Gateway of India, one of the city's most iconic monuments.  As a legacy of the terrorist attacks, there is security screening at the entrances, but the procedures are fast, and not intrusive.  Hotel design and room selection:  The hotel's opulent original building, now"
"We stayed for 2 nights in April and had a wonderful time at this historic, classic and timeless hotel. Great service, beautiful rooms, excellent breakfast and a really memorable experience. Terrific location near the Gateway of India. Reasonably expensive, but in this case well worth the money."
I had avery pleasant stay at Taj . i had visited there to celebrate my parents anniversary. It was ma first gift to parents from ma hard earned money . So the visit there i am never going to forget and cherish it all my lifetime
We have the pleasure of staying in the Taj Mahal Palace twice. The service is impeccable. Nothing is too much trouble. We first stayed in a Tower room. The Tower Rooms look a bit stuck in the 70s but they are comfortable. The Palace Wing is a completely different category. Amazing modern rooms with lots of charm and a wonderful atmosphere. The pool is lovely and the restaurants are excellent. I particularly loved the breakfast restaurant which also has an al fresco area. I cannot fault this hotel and would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended!
"All sorts of heavenly ...service ..hospitality...welcm...etc are on the top most....restaurent.lounges are of extremely high quality...dinner is really mouth watering and made with keeping health conciousness in mind..swimming pool,spa etc are  unforgettable moment. Most intimate moment is Aarati at sunset between 18.30 to18.45 pm sharp.with fluite recital and deep procession."
"This gorgeous hotel is a favorite. Stay in the older wing and be treated to another era. The architecture, and the furniture on display in the corridors, is something special, so definitely wander around. The pool area is a real haven from gloriously crazy Bombay with one of the country's most beautiful verandahs.   HOWEVER... I was most disappointed with quality of its food, mostly its Western cuisine but even its south Indian was under par. Usually the Taj has such good food. We ordered some chicken nuggets to snack on by the pool and really they were no better than McCains or McDonalds pasted together chicken bits - but five times the price. Surely you could use some decent chicken breast and batter for your nuggets. The cafe on the ground floor served up very bland, standard"
"This hotel is amazing. From the first time you enter it's a whole experience of fantastic hospitality in a lush setting. The food, pool and rooms are so enjoyable. Cannot recommend highly enough!! I have stayed at a lot of hotels but this is the most beautiful, luxurious and hospitable I've ever stayed at.   I would love to go back to stay here. It is worth every penny!"
At sea lounge the quality of food needs to Improve. Rest we had a good time. It was a dream for my kids to stay at old Taj Palace and they were happy to be there. Overall it was a good trip and entire family had spent quality time together.
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is a perfectly situated colonial era-behemoth that spares no expense on every inch of this 1903 structure.  There are two parts to this hotel, however, the old part (which is the colonial gem you want to stay in) and the new wing, called the Taj Mahal Tower, which is an ugly concrete addition built in 1973.  My stay at the Taj was nothing less than extraordinary.  This is an ultra luxurious respite from the heavily polluted mayhem of Mumbai.  The hotel has so many staff members I wondered if they easily outnumber the guests.  My room was exceptional, with a huge white marble bathroom with a glass walled shower and an extra large jacuzzi tub.  When I developed a slight tummy ache, the hotel offered the onsite doctor, which I politely refused, because I"
"Service  is  on  of  the  best  in  the  world. You  will  never  regret  of  staying  here.From  check in  to  departure They  will  keep  pampering  you  with  access  to  palace  launge,beautiful  swimmin  pool. Breakfast  at  sea  lounge  . all  are  fab. (  room  at  palace  wing)"
"I was'nt staying at the hotel but it was very enjoyable to look around it. The furnishings were absolutely fantastic and so tastefully displayed. Our first choice was to have one of their "" afternoon teas "" but there was a waiting time of around an hour so we decided to sample a late lunch. The restaurant was light and airy and the waiters were immaculately  dressed which reflected the sheer quality of the hotel itself. Quite surprisingly the menu was varied and inexpensive. I asked for a jacket potato with my food and I can tell readers i've been around the world many times but the jacket potato was the best I have ever tasted in my life. Well cooked with lashings of tasty butter. The flavour remained in my mouth for the rest of the day. I can thoroughly recommend it and invite"
"very nice and cosy place to stay. very rich in history, culture , indian traditions. décor matches the old world charm blended in new age. rooms good. build quality lovable. staff is very hospitable. shamiyana excellent place for buffet. pool excellently managed with wires to prevent birds. palace wing too beautiful and tastefully restored."
"We decided to go in and have some tea in its restaurant on 1st floor. It was one of the best experiences ever - tea in itself was great, but the service, decor and ambience was mind soothing. Amazing place to be and def worth experience - about Rs 2250 for 4 cups of tea, but nothing to contest the value of. Would love to come in and stay, but for next time."
All staffs are so approachable and very accommodating. I would love to come back for my next trip. I enjoyed my stay in the hotel and all my needs was attended properly.  Keep it up and more power TAJ.
I stayed at this hotel for a business conference and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  It is an excellent hotel with wonderful staff who go out of their way to welcome you and make you feel comfortable.  I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to India.
"Service of this hotel is excellent. All amenities are selected and good.  Sometimes, even though Laxury hotel, hte shower presser is not enough and felt the stress, but this hotel has high quality service such small matter."
"Had to take the family to the Taj on their first visit Mumbai. Lobby was teeming with people, I think there was a reception on. We went to the Harbour Bar. Drinks are reasonable for 5 star levels but food was very expensive and quantity low. Excellent service as always by Taj. What I found was that even now security level seemed to be low. Anyone could walk in. Maybe they have modern technology to check guests."
"This was our first trip to India and the Taj Mahal Palace but hopefully it will not be our last.  Staff were all very pleasant, helpful and welcoming. We were escorted to our room with all the facilities being shown to us on the way which made it easier to settle in and know where we needed to go. Our luggage was there when we arrived.  Breakfast was excellent,  as was the Golden Dragon restaurant. The pool and surrounding areas are beautiful and the  cold bottled water and iced face towel's are a welcome refreshment. The small replica coin given when you leave is a lovely touch. When we checked out my husband had left a deodorant and some fruit sweets in the room but had not placed them in the rubbish bin so when our suitcases were brought out to our taxi a bag was on the top"
"The Taj Group of hotels in India is without doubt the best that I have experienced anywhere in the world. I have stayed in Taj hotels throughout India (Kolkata, New Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad & all are to be recommended."
"A dream come true, and a wait for this visit finally was over. No words to describe the excitement. Very good staff, and view was just as if I was in love with it. You really don't feel like moving away. Great empire and great management. Staff are really very very polite. "
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for 5 nights. I was in Mumbai for a conference which was also at the hotel. The service was excellent! The hotel has a lot of history and is beautiful. A great hotel, i would recommend it."
It was a wonderful stay and my family enjoyed very much. Foods are excellent .Cleanliness and other amenities are excellent. Staffs behaviors are excellent. House keeping is marvelous. Every thing is appreciable.   Location is the best in Mumbai. This attracts to visit again.
"The Taj Palace remains my favorite hotel in Mumbai, and is a throwback to an earlier era where service, excellence and charm make for one of the world's great hotels.  Other Taj Group hotels are also spectacular, especially The Rambagh Palace in Jaipur, where we also recently stayed."
"I doubt anyone could find a single fault with this hotel, the team, location, decor and service are all exceptional. The best aspect for me was the constant stream of surprise gifts I found on arrival back to my room daily, from flowers to skin products to a foot bath to jewellery. Beautiful special moments :) Thanks to the team for loving what they do and doing a great job."
"Exactly as you'd expect a hotel this grand to be. Nothing over the top, just pure client service focus. All staff are super friendly and helpful, with no requirement too diffiuclt. Gym was well appointed, pool was a nice size. Pool area was lovely. Rooms were perfectly appointed with all the various lighting and amenities you'd expect. One pet peeve - bathroom didn't have a fan. Screens on windows meant you could keep the door open if you wanted to, but I couldn't seem to find a way to turn up the aircon so it wasn't freezing. We had a business function over two days, and nothing was too hard for the hotel. The buffet was pretty good; could use a few more Western options, but it was all delicious, and someone would help you identify spice levels. Nice views on the water, with"
"What a stunning building, complemented beautifully by attentive, friendly service staff for whom nothing appeared to be a problem. A stay at the Taj is a very low-stress way to ease into the rich contrasts that define this great country. Highly recommended!"
"The Taj Mahal  Palace Hotel is very well located with views of the Gateway to India and the bay busy with boats and ferries from the Sea Lounge where we enjoyed breakfast, lunch, and afternoon tea. When not exploring Mumbai with a hotel organized trip the large pool area is great for relaxing. The in house restaurants where we dined at Masala Kraft (Indian cuisine) and the Souq (Moroccan cuisine) were very good. The well trained hotel staff always were very accommodating. "
"Hotel location is great. Great central location. Hotel is excellent, rooms, service, restaurant (staff is wonderful). Super great special services (hotel car services). Best hotel I have visited. Wonderful experience."
"Does not feel like you came for first time, the warmth and hospitality of staff is so good that you feel like they know you for a long time.. Beautiful hotel, nicely made rooms, delicious food.. good facilities. We went for leisure trip with family.. kids loved the pool and pampering they got from the staff.. Special thanks to our host at the reception Sayonika and Suhas ji in Sea Lounge.. Dont forget to visit Souk, very nice food. Specially the Falafel is out of world. They have Pan Cocktail which is worth a try.. bit sweet but very different"
"We recently stayed at the Taj Palace and loved every minute of our stay in this beautiful hotel. There are two buildings, a newer tower and the original 1923 building. My preference was clearly the old world charm of the original hotel. There are lovely gardens a swimming pool, and ten excellent restaurants. This was truly an oasis of luxury that has a British Colonial atmosphere."
"Great hotel, great location, really friendly staff as our stay was part of an Azamara cruise package we got a free room upgrade and afternoon tea and evening cocktail upgrade. This is an absolutely fabulous hotel with a very very impressive list of previous guest Several USA presidents, Queen of England and numerous famous people. If you are staying in Mumbai this really is the place to stay"
"My husband and I recently stayed 2 nights in this iconic hotel before boarding our cruise in Mumbai.  We were upgraded to a room in the original Palace after booking in the Tower addition, which was great.  The service was absolutely top notch, from the airport pick-up by chauffeured limo to being met as we drew up to the Palace and escorted to our room immediately, and in fact throughout our short stay.  Expensive? Yes, but not overly so.  What was horrendously expensive was dinner at one of the hotel restaurants.  Not only was the food very disappointing, but the taxes piled onto our bill at the end meant the total was absolutely obscene.  Highly recommend eating outside the hotel, other than the included breakfast buffet which was fine, but not brilliant."
"Been there for One night . Truly the experience of a lifetime . They pamper you . I was well comed with pure joy and Smiling Face with pooja , tilak and garland . They upgraded me to a club class with the palace wing room facing sea on top floor . Club class added lot of goodies . The breakfast was lavish and good choice for Vegetarians was available . Swimming pool was good neat clean . Enjoyed my visit and definitely will come back soon . "
"Beautiful, non hotel- like rooms that feel like a stylish, comfortable but sophisticated home. Wonderful, friendly, easy atmosphere throughout the hotel. Excellent services & lovely employees.  How I enjoyed the delicious Indian breakfasts in my room:  pure heaven!  I can't drum up a single complaint except that the lobby was sometimes too cold.  And  the spectacular flower arrangements, in dazzling designs and abundance and the charming atmosphere never failed to delight me..  I wish I could spend my life there."
"Can't really say more than had#s already been said in other reviews about the plus side. We had a package which included afternoon tea, pre and post dinner drinks and breakfast. What a great deal. No penny pinching or limits on what you can have, just impeccable service and quality. Staff were excellent, including our butler who was a gem and who did a great job (much better than I could have done) of ironing quite a complicated dress for me! We will be back."
Very beautiful and luxurious hotel.Once you enter the hotel you will feel enchanted with beautiful interior .The ever smiling reception desk will be there to assist you.Very neat and clean .Very comfortable rooms.A lot of services as per your requirement are there.
"I have stayed at this iconic hotel a few times before and as ever it lived up to its reputation for excellent or above average service.  this time I was there for 3 nights and the time seemed to fly past.  The room I had was in a palace wing which are well appointed.  I was on the Club floor seaview, but sadly one of the two windows in my room was fogged over as the double glazing needed attention.  I would not ask for this type of room again.  The rooms in the palace wing with a pool view are fine, as the breakfast area - the sea lounge have excellent views over the Gateway.    My room was just not worth the cost and previous rooms and reviews from me have been better."
It was heartening to see the excellent service during my stay at the Taj Palace in Mumbai. Everything was beyond my expectations  - I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a luxurious stay in Mumbai.
Good to see Taj representing Indian culture and helping in creating very good image of Indian culture to tourists. Unmatchable hospitality and comfort. The hotel which shall now be termed as Heritage of India maintains perfect balance between ancient history and modern amenities.
"arrived at the hotel middle of the night, was escorted to the room after being met by concierge staff in the lobby, who told me all about the hotel... I was upgraded to the palace suites...the room was amazing, everything in the room was perfect with 24 hour butler service.... the buffet breakfast was very good and there was something there to cater to most peoples tastes.... from check into check out everything was perfect,,, i could not of asked for anything more... all the staff were very friendly and always professional."
"There's always a risk that if a hotel is described as a landmark, historic and iconic it will be trading on past glories rather than drive standards forward. In the case of the Taj Mahal Palace you needn't worry. We chose to stay in the Palace Wing which certainly oozes old world style – but not at the expense of modern luxury. It's a busy hotel (the Tower Wing means there are 560 bedrooms) and the place certainly has a buzz, but the staff ensured that we never felt that we were reduced to ‘faceless numbers’. Apparently, Taj staff are trained for 2 years before they are allowed to face guests – based on our experience a fair amount of that time must be spent on memory training. We only stayed for 3 nights but by the second morning our waiter had remembered what we had eaten the"
"i highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Mumabi for business or shopping. Liked the convince place of the hotel and the nearby to the markets; and the easily transportation, and the value of price. will surely return back to stay in TAJ COLABA AGAIN."
"had the time of our lives.. My wife, our two year old Son and I were upgraded to the Palace wing at the Club Level and were pampered so much that it was hard to check out.  Like the famous lyric goes - you can check out, but can Never leave. Taj hospitality is at its best. The rooms in the Palace wing are so beautiful and well designed. Ensure you stay there and take the club level benefits. Its worth every Dime."
"this is so-called have-to-stay hotel in mumbai. Great view, great facilities, first-class service team. Despite some small issues, overall experience here worth the money. Breakfast buffet needs some improvement compared with other hotels, however coffee is perfectly served."
"If you're considering the Taj Mahal Palace then there's a one word response - Go. In all my years of travelling this is the best hotel I have visited.  Both my wife and myself loved how all guests are treated the same. No one is looked up and down and judged accordingly as in many other international hotels. Everyone was friendly and keen to ensure our stay, two nights, went smoothly.   We both liked how, given our 25th wedding anniversary, they were able to 'upgrade' us to a club room on the 6th floor with a pool view. We also liked the small touches such as flowers and even a pashmena they provided for my wife after returning to our room after dinner which matched her dress. What attention to detail!!  If you have a club or suite room you get lots of goodies including free"
"We stayed at the The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai for 3 nights late April 2017 on a room and breakfast basis.  We wanted to stay at the Taj just for the experience on our way down to Kerala. This is a beautiful hotel and generally everything including the staff are first class apart from my later comments in this report.  In the wake of the attack on the hotel a few years ago, security at the entrance is stringent with precautions similar to that at Heathrow,Terminal 3.  Once in the hotel the check-in was smooth and efficient and we were shown to a lovely room in the old part of the hotel, with amazing views over the Gate of India. The room was excellent, the beds very comfortable and it was cleaned properly every day.  This is an amazing hotel and everything at the hotel worked"
"Mesmerising, Excellent and outstanding are the words coming to my mind. An unique experience of Taj Stay in the city of dreams. Service is awesome. Justified whatever is charged for. Heritage of Mumbai."
"We had a conference at the Crystal Room and we experienced the impeccable brand called The Taj... welcome at the y sense client has a need or service at the tea breaks or even the quality of seating, acoustics and rest of arrangements all were by the standard Taj is famous for.  Have never been able to fathom how the staff are always there ahead of your having to reach out for them... fantastic place.  And the views are awesome.. attach some from near the side exit"
Wanted to visit there since a long time and when I was in bombay.. Didn't miss the opportunity to drop in for a coffee at the beautiful palace. The hotel is very beautifully made and would recommend to atleast make a visit. The property is breathtaking.. 
"Excellent, gives a feel of a stay at the palace. Absolute excellence of service & professionalism shown by the staff. we had an incident where we forgot few documents at the hotel but they had taken special efforts to bring it to the airport."
A great experience - One of the best hotels in India in a class of its own - Way the history/ tradition is preserved and portrayed by the hotel is amazing - Excellent hospitality and great food - A life time memory of stay in Palace wing - Can't wait to return  -
"I think it takes a minimum of three separate elements to make a great hotel. Firstly there's the staff, secondly the food then the location. There are other factors of course but I'm not sure they're as important; I've had fabulous stays in less than salubrious surroundings and am convinced that it's those three things that make a great stay. Well...  The people at the Taj are first class, what's more they know what first class is. They're delicate in their delivery of exceptional service. They're confident in what they do and charming in the way they do it.  The food is very good, consistent in its quality and presented in such beautiful ways.  As far as location goes, well I doubt if you'd find a better one. It's easy to get around and perfectly located with wonderful views. "
"Perfect stay recently with all the familiar faces around. It is really in a class of its own. Spent a day at the poolside with my CDWalkman (!!!), my Bollywood trash mags ('Stardust', 'Cine Blitz') with the genuinely lovely staff. Bliss! and Palace wing rocks! A local friend visited me for a drink one night and as soon as he entered the reception area he exclaimed: ""Wow this place smells nice!"" See, now my favourite hotel in the world has its own signature scent! Like the hotel, it will take your breath away!"
Afternoon tea at the world's famous Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Visited by presidents and pop stars alike. Faultlessly attentive yet discreet service and wonderful cakes.  Luckily we got a window table with lovely view out to the Gateway and the bay beyond. What's not to like. 
"Everything was excellent and fantastic and the hotel was very special in all the services and the reception was terrible by the hotel and it was a very impressive and special stay at this hotel First of all, I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to all the employees of this wonderful hotel, which is distinguished in terms of reception and services. Thankfully, it was a special trip with this hotel"
"View from the Hotel is beautiful as it faces ""Gateway of India""  Restaurants are pretty costly but favourable as per the star rating of Hotel. It is beautifully constructed from inside and outside and offers 11 different restaurants (correct me if I have written wrong counts)"
I found this hotel very good service and food quality is good special when I talk about american food. I must try once visiting taj hotel mumbai.  Book travel and other stuff by tourhelpy its best online chat support in India. 
"It’s an epitome of Luxury. Right from the moment you will enter the gates you will come across an extremely rich history of India and its veterans. Way history is preserved and portrayed by the hotel is amazing. You will come across some of the very rarer pictures/comments of famous personalities of the world. You will get to understand the uniqueness of this place when you see this historical pieces in conjunction with some of the most luxuries brand of the modern world like Louis Vuitton. Taj Colaba also offers some of the most luxurious restaurants of Mumbai with a wide variety of exotic cuisine including Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Café and a Multi cuisine. Taj Colaba is also know for the first legal bar of India."
A charming hotel which provides modern comforts in a setting with great atmosphere and a sense of history. Food and drinks are expensive but if you stay club class the palace lounge provides an excellent 'happy hour ' with very good food and canapé selection plus non- alcoholic drinks throughout the day. The staff are marvellous and very welcoming.  The pool is small compared with many modern hotels but ranks among my favourite. It is a green oasis in busy and crowded city. I certainly hope to visit again. I can recommend the city tour and hire a guide. The hotel concierge will arrange this and the 4 hours is extremely good value especially if this is the first time you have visited Mumbai. The hotel is Heritage Tour is 40mins well spent and is free. 
"Just returned from a holiday in India and Sri Lanka. The Taj was our first hotel and a great beginning to our holiday. We arrived quite late since our flight was delayed and the staff were very welcoming. We were even given an upgrade and I must say it felt very nice. We loved staying there, the atmosphere is cosy and chic at the same time. The pool was amazing to dip into after a long day of sightseeing. All the staff were attentive and very nice, from breakfast to dinner! Would definitely return. Cristina Soares and Pedro Palma Carlos"
"Did a staycation here with our toddler, and was blown away by the care, attention to detail with which they ensured our anniversary celebrations were memorable - be it little surprises in our room ; the upgrade to the Heritage wing on arrival. Taking the Heritage walk made us appreciate the place even more - the place is a proud ""House of Firsts"" , an institution itself and does a delightful job in making us welcome. Here is one off the bucket-list (since childhood) - thank you :)"
Proud of its Heritage building & is a tourist attraction in the prime location at South Mumbai .Very well maintained & is always full of people some visitors or in house guests or just by passers visiting Mumbai for sight seeing Must go to visit if in Mumbai as its architecture is worth appreciating 
"Legendary for a good reason - The Taj Mahal Palace exceeds all expectations. Fabulous room, excellent food and impeccable service - an unforgettable experience.  We booked the tower for our anniversary but were upgraded to a Palace club room with fabulous views of the Gateway of India! Every single meal we had was excellent (Lunch at Golden Dragon, High Tea at the Sea Lounge, Dinner/Post dinner Chocolate and Cognac at the Club Lounge and Breakfast at Shamiyana)."
Just the most wonderful hotel. Everything about the place is just perfect. The rooms (we were upgraded to the Heritage wing) the staff and the breakfast made our final couple of days in India just great. Would love to visit again
"This is still the best place to stay in Bombay; we have stayed many times since 1995 and seen it change and grow but never lose its unique ambience and service.  This is luxury at its best, both in terms of the staff attention and the building itself.  We were so fortunate to be upgraded to a new suite on the 17th floor, it was fabulous and we loved every minute.  Along with the suite came special privileges, such as cold drinks in the lounge (palace wing), afternoon tea, cocktails and brandy and chocolates at night.  Wow, it was all great.  We didn't want to leave!"
Awesome hotel nice pool luxery rooms sea view rooms  When i reached they did very warm welcome with very nice beads malla and while check out they gave 2 lucky coins service of the stuff is very good i love the hotel 
A truly magnificent hotel. You must go thru security in order to enter the hotel. A result of the bombing years ago. Lots of staff all around the hotel.  Beautiful public areas plus some very nice shops and restaurants.
One of the best hotel of India. Location of this particular property was so good and services are the same as the name suggest Taj. For me this become a memorable trip of Mumbai because of Taj Mahal Palace.
Top notch facilities and location when visiting Mumbai. Will not stay anywhere else. Hotel is amenable to all that Mumbai has to offer. The Staff are very user friendly and are an example to Hotel Staff worldwide.
"We had a wonderful stay for two nights. Starting from the welcome by the front desk to the time of check out,  the staff was really happy to help and ensure you were well looked after irrespective of whether you were at a restaurant, lounge or just by the pool. The house keeping staff did a wonderful job in having your room made up by the time you were back from your breakfast."
"Every moment of our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace was special. From our welcome through to our beautiful sea view room in the heritage part of the hotel, everything was perfect. Breakfast in the Sea Lounge had huge variety and has beautiful views over the bay. The BBQ by the pool in the evening is delicious and we had incredible prawns. Definitely take the staff up on the offer of a free tour of the hotel as it is full of history and well worth learning about. The pool is simply stunning! "
"We had a nice spacious room in the Heritage part of the hotel with a great view of the sea and the Gateway of Mumbai. The hotel is lovely inside, and to see the architecture and history was interesting. The pool is very nice and a great place to cool down and relax after sightseeing around the city Good to stay here for the experience.  Harshal Jadhav our Guest Relations took special care of us . Thanks for being a wonderful host and doing everything to make our stay comfortable and our 4th Marriage Anniversary a memorable & enjoyable one. Thanks again for the amazing Cake and the room decoration for our Anniversary Celebration.Thanks to the Housekeeping Team at Taj Mahal Palace for the decoration and their creativity. Taj Mahal Palace Ambience is serene and distressing , just"
"Definitely one of the worlds best hotels. Classic, timeless, yet new and modern. Service with a smile. Everyone wants to please. Problems and issues are handled with grace and understanding. Eclectic mix of world travelers. Well located in downtown Mumbai near India Gate and new hip Fort area."
"Overall experience was amazing & with much much satisfactory.  Wonderful hospitality especially each moment someone will ask ""Do you need any assistance"" in case if they see that you are looking for something. Staff is very down to earth. Good combination of employee...junior to senior (no age diff.) and all are well trained & professional. They made my trip more memorable giving surprise like room decorated with red baloon and cake. The pool is very nice and the food they provide are simply world class.   Certainly, This is Iconic Hotels in the world and would like to visit again and again.....!!!  Feedback : My door key was not working and all the way I have to come down from 16th floor to reception who made new key. If Hotel can have telephone in passage area to call at"
"If staying in South Mumbai, wanna spend a bit extra n getvt best experience then Of course it have to be The Taj Palace. Amazing experience. Staff is so polite and best at their work.  If staying here then definitely should do the High Tea. Its d best high ever did. Gorgeous room n bathroom was ooomps...smiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyes Highly recommended if u want royal n luxury experience... Old wing is very very beautiful. Hospitality at it's best, pool area is very relaxing n beautiful. Would love to stay again here... "
Everything in those 3 days experience of my vacation at that hotel was perfect. The crew was so kind and nice and truly cared .  The food at the lounge was perfect the amazing pool and the awesome gym and the so tasty breakfast made no doubt that I'll come back again soon.
Amazing lounge and good food. Different restaurants are inside according to cuisine. We went for Indian food and had really goid experience  I didn't find it very expensive considering the fact that this hotel is a five star 
"I loved The Hotel.Wish to visit again and again. Staff Behaviour was very good.Wonderful hospitality. The decoration, The ritual way they perform especially the flute was wonderful. love the Taj.The pool is very nice and the food they provide are simply world class."
"How do you rate a hotel that already figures in the CNN.Com's Top 10 Iconic Hotels in the world. Many new hotels with ultra modern amenities have sprung up across India, yet Taj Mahal Palace retains its charm on account of its heritage status and impeccable service.  Although, i am a resident of  Mumbai itself, i had booked 2 rooms in this hotel earlier this month, to celebrate our Silver Jubilee wedding anniversary.  The Hotel went out of its way to make our celebration memorable.  Will return, for sure."
"This hotel is most enjoyable!  Because I had 2 separate reservations for our time in Mumbai we had the lovely experience of staying both in the Palaxe size (older part) and the Tower side (newer part) with a view of the Gateway to India and the sea.  We enjoyed both of our rooms very much. The palace side room was very traditional and a little bigger, and the tower side was very modern with some drawbacks to the way the. Loser was was designed. But the view was beautiful.  There are many nice restaurants-Chinese, Indian, French (hard to find but exquisite fine dining) in the tower, and Mediterranean. All good. The people, all wearing traditional Indian dress) were so nice and helpful and friendly. They really made the e Perone e perfect!"
"great place facing the sea and The Gateway of India! Their sea lounge is a great place to enjoy a great view of the Arabian Sea and also has one of the finest high teas in the world with choices galore of sandwiches, chinese, indian and continental snacks. Great array of desserts! Excellent value for money.Open from 3-7pm everyday. Go hungry!"
The Courtesy and comfort of TAJ is incomparable. Had a very memorable 1 night stay . The room was comfortable .  Would recommend the Hotel anytime. The arrival eperience was fantatstic except the Car park issue. Long quest of Cars jamming the street is a issue Taj needs to resolve.
"if i will visit next time Mumbai = 100% would like stay here, clean, rooms large, spa very nice and proffesionel, i fell me very safety and in good hands, breakfast very tasty. low internet free, fast internet for 800 INR"
"This hotel has got to be the best on the world. The hospitality is beyond comprehension, just genuinely kind and courteous. The history and architecture of the hotel is a museum in its own category. The manager of the masala craft presented my mother a complimentary cake for her trip to her birth city after 59 yrs. She is still in awe if the experience here, last but not least they upgraded our grand luxury sea view to a taj business. Thank you taj staff for making our trip back to india memorable."
"Room, restaurant service excellent.  We had breakfast included which was ""American"" or Asian.  We had a tour of the hotel .  The pool was inviting, loungers comfortable.  The room stewards went out of their way to make things right.  No feather pillows on request, no check in, just sign with your credit card in the room.  Good location for the cruise pier, they will arrange their own limousines for pick up at airport and return."
"Celebrating my mothers 60th birthday at the prestigious Taj Mahal was the best memory!!  Super warm welcome n a very smooth checkin.  The room was as imagined n a perfect view of The Gateway of India.  Thank you to all at The Taj Mahal Palace, Colaba!!"
"We stayed 3 nights at the hotel and were satisfied on all counts - service, restaurants, hotel amenities and friendliness of the staff. We were upgraded to the Palace Wing which we loved.  Room was large as was the bathroom with both a bath and a shower. Would definitely recommend to fellow travellers!"
"I loved the experience at this place.   The palace room was beautiful, I originally thought about booking a tower room, don't, even the area outside your room will be outstandingly beautiful, the smell is divine too. The staff brought a teddy bear and puzzle each for our children on arrival which was a wonderful surprise.   Breakfast in the sea lounge was divine, the staff are so attentive but not annoying just very helpful and intuitive. The outfits the staff wear throughout the hotel are very pretty also. The view is outstanding whilst having breakfast at the lounge. Loved the omelettes and pancakes etc some excellent chefs who cook things exactly who you want them.  The pool is wonderful, the temperature is perfect. Lovely that they give you water and the occasional snack"
"I absolutely loved this hotel from the minute I walked in, the beautiful smell and the serene atmosphere relaxed me after the hectic bustle of the Mumbai streets.  The pool side and garden areas were blissful (although of course the Mumbai horns and cars' stretching could still very much be heard poolside but it really was just a reminder that you were in this vibrant city!).  We were delighted to have been given an upgrade and so got to stay in the historical wing which really was just fantastic.  The breakfast was fantastic, as was afternoon tea both of which were served in a beautiful light and airy room which had views out to India gate and the sea.   I also want to put a special mention to the hairdresser here - I had a cut and blow dry while here and was so so happy with"
Great stay at the Taj  Mahal Palace hotel. The staff were brilliant and attentive.  E particularly enjoyed the high tea and the tour of the hotel. The room was floorless and the pool was a welcomed delight.
Feels like one of the wonders of world.. Awesome ambience.. delicious food.. location is best as opposite is Gateway of India. . Very costly but worth visiting once to feel like u visiting any special palace 
This hotel is just beautiful both outside and inside. The service is impeccable. I can't fault it! You are given a nice welcome! Complimentary water is given if you are by the pool. Our room was pool Facing and so the view was nice. The palace lounge was a nice quite area and food was great! 
"Lovely welcome, great room (little tight with extra bed) very helpful staff. Great pool, very helpful attentive staff around pool. Lovely clean fresh towels, free water and friendly faces. Great family restaurant for the children. Beautiful floral displays around hotel. Lovely free afternoon tea in lounge. Perfect location for sightseeing. Great view from hotel. Most enjoyable stay, many memories made here. The horns from the cars stop over night!  "
I enjoyed my stay in this Hotel very much. Breakfast was great and also Service of the staff. Any time again!!!! Only negative Thing was defective Sauna. Location is great - just opposite of GATEWAY OF INDIA which is a very nice antic building
"The Taj Mahal palace should be called one of the ""wonders of the hotel world"". It is absolutely exquisite, and an experience in itself. It is definitely worth spending the extra bit to stay in the palace. The service is sublime, and overlooking the harbor while eating the delicious breakfast is superb. It is a definite must visit in the beautiful Mumbai! "
"Memorable Experience at The Taj Mahal Place Hotel Mumbai.  Courteous Staff, Superb Food makes it worth visiting.  Spa is really well maintained.  Ambience is very soothing & refreshing.  Evening High Tea Experience at Pool side was Great."
"Recently visited Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai with my Family; such a Delightful experience it was... And I can simply say - Wah Taj!!!  Some of the Main Points are - The Greatest Level of Hospitality we have experienced till date, The Superb Property and the Location, Beautiful Ambience, Neat Rooms and Super Food... 9.50 out of 10 (My mind block has reserved that 0.50) :)  The Property ========== One of the OLDEST 5 Star Indian Hotels in Mumbai and in INDIA... Located bang opposite of ""Gateway of India"" at the sea front... Once inside, you can imagine and experience the size of property and facilities within. I say this because, you may find the entrance as a shallow lane almost just located on the road; most of the time creating traffic situation due to guest vehicles moving"
The location was perfect.  We stayed here for our last two nights in India.  The staff were top notch.  Our reservation included breakfast and we were able to get by with two meals for the day.  We enjoyed the afternoon tea at the Sea View lounge.    It was so easy to walk all around the area.  We visited museums and shops as well as took a boat to Elephantas Island.  A great way to end our trip in the beautiful country.  We didn't want to leave!
This is my first ever review for anything . Do not usually take the effort to do so. But am so delighted with the service that had to absolutely make the effort to do the same !  Great going and keep up the good work  Amazing food at Souk !  
"The original hotel building is beautiful, the staircase to be marvelled at. The staff are friendly and pleasant and cannot be faulted, everyone works to make your stay a great experience.  Lots of restaurants to choose from, breakfast in the Sea Lounge was always tasty (as long as you're in the know of what the kitchen has to offer rather than the buffet), the complimentary use of the Palace lounge is a nice touch for guests of the main hotel building."
"Our second trip to India but first time to Mumbai. Arrived about 7.00 AM after a flight from the UK and had arranged early access to our sea facing room in the Tower Wing. We stayed for 3 nights and I think this is probably the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in, and we enjoy nice hotels. We had requested a room on a high floor and we were on the 10th floor with a wonderful view over the plaza below and the Gateway monument. We attended a very informative organised tour of the hotel on our first evening explaining the history of the hotel, well worth doing.    The attention to detail in every respect is something to be envied by other hotels. All the staff are so friendly, polite and helpful but I must mention Sandeep, the concierge, So knowledgeable and extremely helpful in"
"if you expect a lot , you will loose your happiness, they feel our is big ,old grate hotel we can behave any thing like  is grate, and they is lack of roteen taring and their behavior checking with gusts through cameras, they never feeling l I am working"
"We went to for tea and cake as we were passing by. The service was EXCELLENT. Environment was relaxing and food absolutely spot on. We were worried we would not be ""dressed up"" enough as we were touring. But there was no pre-judgment and we felt treated as equals. We loved that we could freely take photos without being told off or getting in anyone's way! This venue sets a brilliant example and leaves a very high benchmark for other high end establishments to follow, especially those in London! Trainers or no trainers - an experience that the extremely hospitable staff allow to be enjoyed by all. Did not seem overpriced, all the dishes deserved every penny we gave them. Would love to stay here one day :D"
"very nice hotel ,the reception out side i like it, the lobby is beuteful with nice shopping stores, good location ,clean ,comfortable, suitable for relaxation and shoping ,like more the restaurant at the swimming pools, all the stuff are good"
"when ever you stay in this hotel you will defiantly fall in lone with this place. A truly truly wonderful experience great service, great food in all restaurants specially golden dragon  if you want to experience the Chinese taste then that the place for you. One of the best hotel in the world and Taj Mahal Palace truly deserve this title.  Thank you Taj for giving me such a good experiance"
"We stayed here for a couple of nights recently after attending a conference in Pune.  What a fabulous experience!  We  (our son was with us on the trip) stayed in rooms in the old, palace wing, under the ""club"" rate that gave us access to the Sea Lounge buffet breakfast, and the Palace Lounge downstairs for tea, cocktails, and nightcaps the rest of the day, as well as a courtesy drive from the hotel to the airport.  There were some other extra perks, like free laundry for two items (but you had to pay for pressing!), and personal butler.  This was well worth the extra money, but in any case the hotel is just superb.  The rooms were spacious and beautifully furnished, the bathrooms were grand and very up-to-date.  The service was impeccable and very gracious, the word ""pampered"""
"There are no words to describe the experience in the flagship Taj hotel in South Mumbai. Apart of the wonderful courtesy of the staff you have to try the maximum relax in Jiva SPA, the ultimate level of customer service. The type of massage and the level of the oil they use treats you like a Lord. The Lord in the Taj World. "
We had stayed here for a night and i must say that this hotel has the wow factor . everything is just perfect . restaurants serve various kind of cuisine . It is a premium hotel but totally justified with the supreme service that it offers . This hotel also has a history to it and must commend the management on the resilience .
Palaces are for Kings and we are fortunate that Mr. Jamsetji Tata built this Palace for all Indians.... Go experience it atleast once in your life time..... I am sure you will get addicted to luxury here....
I love the Taj. The first thing that I noticed on this visit was that Shamianna has moved back to its old location of days gone by. The Hotel is unmatched in its service quality. The food here is very good. The views of the gateway of India and the little boats in the water are very relaxing. The Taj Hotels location is unmatched.
"You get what you pay for in this world - well worth the expense! Wonderful, friendly, helpful service; beautiful room; lovely garden with great swimming pool. A perfect base for exploring the city and Elephanta Island."
"This hotel cannot be praised highly enough. Everything from the buffet breakfast to the lush facilities to the helpful staff were faultless. It's well located and perfect to return to after working up a sweat on the streets of Mumbai. You can retire in your air conditioned room, jump in the immaculate pool or indulge in a spa treatment. The buffet breakfast caters to a variety of palates, including traditional Indian dishes, western staples and middle eastern mezze. The building is simply stunning and exudes grandeur, while the staff couldn't be more helpful. "
We were all content with the service and hotel during our stay. There is nothing negative to say. All staff especially receptionists and the team in concierge were very helpful. The rooms and saloons of the hotel were all well decorated and luxirious. Thank you very much.
"Taj Mahal hotel with its location, facing the Gateway of India, little boats in the sea make for a great view to wake up in the morning. From there the experience just keeps getting better. Hotel staff is thoroughly professional with the right amount of personal touch to make you literally feel like at home. Highly recommend to everyone to experience the charm of staying at this hotel."
Staff are warm welcome at reception. Room is very clean and cosy bed and surprise turn down service with foot therapist. Staffs are very helpful and friendly. Sea lounge is good for evening cocktail with good panoramic view with gate way of India and Arabian sea.
"I stayed in the historical palace wing (and there is also a tower wing which is new and not historical). My whole experience with this hotel has been very good. Excellent service in all areas from front-desk to housekeeping and to the service at restaurants. Very clean and nice decoration in the room, always a very good smell in the air; especially in the lobby. Just overlooking the ""Gateway to India"", it has a very good location as well. So, all in all, I would recommend this hotel to everyone."
"I booked this hotel as the final surprise for my mum on our India trip for her 60th and my 40th birthday.  On arrival the check in area was busy and we had a slight wait, but it was worth it...... The lovely check in girl upgraded our roon to a Club Room on the 6th floor and it was absolutely amazing.  The room was huge, spotless, comfortable and so well decorated.  We were in heaven.  On the walk up to our room we were asked if what we were doing in India and I mentioned that we were on a mother / daughter tour for our special birthdays and this was our final luxury stop before we flew home.  We were treated to the room being decorated with balloons, birthday cake, a lovely trinket box and foot spas.  Every single member of staff we spoke to during our stay was delightful and a"
"This hotel is 5-star all the way from the beautiful architecture to the spacious rooms to the very courteous and helpful staff.  It is one of those, ""wow! Am I really here?"" Hotels for a special occasion.  The location, near the Gateway to India, is ideal.  The Japanese Restaurant Wasabi is fabulous, the lounge areas elegant.  No wonder all the famous dignitaries stay here!  We loved it, the spa, the lounging by the pool, the drinks in the colonial-style bar, the sumptuous breakfast...we wish we could have stayed more than three days and hope to return someday."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is an experience not to be missed.  We stayed in the historic wing with view of the pool and garden.  The property is very well maintained and the staff is friendly, helpful and highly trained. The rooms are tastefully appointed, the 4 fixture marble bathrooms are immaculate.  The mattresses, pillows, and linens are comfortable and of fine quality. We took a guided tour of the property which was fascinating. We are looking forward to returning again soon."
"It was surprising to see the pandemonium during the check-in process - the lobby was over crowded, the staff was looking hassled. But, after the initial hiccups, the stay was a pleasant one. We stayed in the heritage section, the room was nothing exceptional, but the food at Wasabi By Morimoto and then Golden Dragon, more than made it up! The view from the Lebanese food restaurant, Souk, was breathtaking; view from the 21st floor overlooking the Gateway of India and the Arabian sea is truely remarkable. Will goo back again!"
"A truly 5 star hotel. Many hotels around the world have a 5star rating and some of them struggle to match up, not this wonderful Taj. Perfect location opposite the Gate of India and looking out over the Arabian sea. The staff, the service, the rooms, the gardens, the restaurants all truly 5 stars."
"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in April '17.  It was our first stay here and we're extremely impressed. Stunning attention to detail from all members of staff, who are a credit to the Taj brand.  Great afternoon tea, fantastic breakfast, lovely pool.  We also done the 'Mumbai at Dusk' tour through the hotel which I can highly recommend.  Big mention to Adrian, our Butler, who went above and beyond at every chance (for our room 578).  Will definitely be returning!!"
we have checked in at 11 and without informing me for an early check in  fee they charged me one addtitional night. despite the fact that my resevation was for one night they chsrged 2 nights. upon arrival they didnot informed us that we will face a fee or even worst a full day charge
"It is good to know that such an iconic hotel is not just coasting but provides excellent, caring service and immaculate rooms.  We were upgraded to a club, India Gate view room though we only stayed one night (unfortunately!) with access to the club lounge with its complimentary afternoon tea with a wide selection of delectable little bits, and drinks later on.  Dinner in the Indian restaurant was very good.  We took breakfast in the Sea Lounge and had just sat down after selecting our food from the buffet (very good pastries) when a waiter came and said that a window table had just become free, would we like to move tables.  Very attentive.  We also enjoyed the interesting Heritage tour of the hotel."
"I was travelling alone and was really looking forward to my stay at the Taj. I have a passion for travel combined with excellent hotels and service and wanted to experience what I had heard the Taj could offer. I certainly can say I was not disappointed!  I was welcomed with a room upgrade which set a great tone for the stay. The traditional welcome was special and the room tour was very professional and helpful. The pool area was exceptional and great for a post-flight dip. At each point, the staff were so lovely and welcoming. From the lovely bell boys, to the lift attendant, to the pool boys. Everyone was welcoming, polite, friendly and professional.  The assistant manager in the Harbour bar was particularly helpful and arranging my reservation at Wasabi. The Sea Lounge was"
"I selected this hotel for the local and history; and staying here did not disappoint.  It is truly a beautiful hotel.  We enjoyed it so much, that I cancelled another hotel to re-book her for our return visit to Mumbai.   You can't go wrong staying here."
"I was here along with my wife to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. The Royal Welcome provided to us along with the Room Up Gradation service of the Staff was commendable. Further, the Room decoration along with the Cake and Flower Decoration provided by the Hotel Staff was the most pleasant surprise for us. We thank the entire Staff for making our stay so long lasting and Memorable"
"An amazing hotel.  One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  The service level is amazing.  The staff are supper attentive and well trained.  The best service i have ever seen.  Rooms are large and clean.    The amenities are also greta,  The pool is very nice.  The breakfast buffet is impressive and their sushi restaurant, Wasabi, is very nice.    We stayed in the Palace Wing and I would highly recommend staying here if you are going to Mumbai."
"lovely staff & ambience , wonderful stay . Excellent location , city center , beautiful hotel , great food . Breakfast buffet is top class , service , helpfulness , cleanliness all excellent. Thank you ! Greatly appreciate."
"Outstanding trip, purely blissful experience. Arrived late from airport due to baggage issues but that was the last hiccup that we experienced. Taken care of from start to finish, pure indulgence. 3rd visit in past 5 years, and standard has been maintained every time. If possible, stay at the palace but honestly the whole thing is well worth it."
Stay at Taj is always awesome. The staff always take care of u in a personalised manner and make u feel comfortable. Booked room in tower wing and they gave me complimentary in palace wing. Always stayed at tower wing but for the first time stayed at palace wing. It was a great feeling to be in the heritage building. The welcome at the time of checkin was very sweet. I never felt so special. Full marks to the team Taj Mahal palace for hospitality at it's best. Love u Taj group. It was unforgettable stay again in Taj Mahal palace mumbai.
The Taj offered stylish and comfortable traditionally styled accommodation in one of the top spots in Mumbai. Right across from the India Gate easy to access and yet surprisingly quiet inside. The staff gave faultless service making our stay most enjoyable
"We stayed in the Palace, a wonderful experience with outstanding service from every staff member from the bell boys to the restaurant and reception staff. The architecture and interior design and ambiance is beautiful and relaxing.  Following a room allocation error by the hotel on check-in at 2:15am we were upgraded - a true demonstration of the honourable customer service.  Ultimately we had a stunning room and overal experience in this truly iconic hotel. Thank you ! It's a good location for visiting the Gate of India, Churchgate and Mumbai."
"We have had a great time at this hotel. The interior is superb and there is so much history to the hotel that makes it very special.  But it totally depends on which room you book. Starting from the Club Rooms you will get all the amenities such as a room in the historic wing with its beautiful designed rooms, a 24/7 butler service, a special breakfast. You wont be staying in the huge tower which doesnt even look like it is part of the hotel. You will stay in the picturesque building that is captured in so many pictures, not only by people staying at the hotel but by almost everyone who comes to Mumbai. So make sure to book at least the Club Room. The breakfast buffet and location is great and you overlook the harbour. You will also get complimentary access to the club lounge"
"Let me be clear. This is a marvellous hotel that's well worth placing on your bucket list.  To stay in an iconic hotel and open the curtains in your room to stare down at one of the best known tourist sights in India, India Gate, does life get sweeter?  The rooms are large and luxuriously appointed, staff helpful and pleasant, breakfast offerings are diverse and interesting and there are a number of first class restaurants, useful deli and numerous high end shops. Plus, if you plan well ahead, you can snare some significant savings in the room tarrif. The Taj experience is outstanding.  However, we did encounter some difficulties.  The first was communicating via emails. We wanted to hire a hotel car to take us to the airport at the end of our stay. After a flurry of emails, we"
This is an amazing Hotel.  The service from the moment you arrive in your taxi outside to the time you have to leave - nothing is too much trouble.. Our room was incredible - we were upgraded to a Club Room - it was amazing - the bed was huge - the view was spectacular - straight in front of the Gate of India. The bathroom was immaculate. The Heritage Walk was very informative and well worth doing.  The swimming pool was beautiful and a very large size. I swam in the mornings before breakfast - a lovely way to start your day.  The hotel is ideally situated for walking to the Art Gallery and the Museums.  If you visit Mumbai - you must stay in this hotel.
"The Taj Mahal Palace goes above and beyond, exceeding expectations.  Beautiful surroundings and wonderful experience.  The location is excellent as well.  Close to the Gateway of India and Colaba for some great shopping."
Where to start...... you have to go through security checks every time you go into the hotel. You walk into an amazing lobby. The staff are so friendly.  Reception are so helpful. The rooms are lovely. The pool area is fabulous .  The whole hotel is just 1st class
"Part of a party of 6 staying here for 2 nights after 10 days of luxury in Goa (see other reviews!) for Leela and Coco Shambhala.  As we arrived we were delighted to be told we had been upgraded from our sea view tower block rooms. What a delight - I love an upgrade!   We were taken to our rooms and disappointed is an understatement. My room had no windows! Well it had some in the bathroom which you couldn't see out of! Beautifully decorated but nothing could take away from the gloomy room. I can't imagine who would want a room with no windows! Apparently it's a relaxation room because it's so quiet....... I just got a bad vibe in there, I couldn't wait to get out! I cannot imagine anyone staying happily in this previous room, this trip is a family treat and that room felt like a"
This is by far the best 5 star hotel I have ever stayed at. The hotel is beautiful and is in an amazing historical location. However what makes this hotel such a fantastic place to stay is the level of service provided. The staff cannot do enough to ensure you have a perfect stay and without exception go above and beyond the call of duty. This is now my favourite hotel in the world! Thanks to all the Taj staff for making it such a wonderful stay.
"Our guide took us through the hotel.  Very nice.  Luxury.  We went to a chocolate shop in the hotel and bought chocolate.   We would have stayed at the hotel but there was no double bed rooms, only king.  So we stayed at Four Seasons instead.  Yet, the Taj looks like a great place to stay, and an awesome location, to be be able to walk out of the hotel in the midst of the colonial part of Mumbai."
it was an great surprise for me . it was an very good experience . The room are very spacious  breakfast was excellent.food was good. staff was very friendly . ambience was really good. the location of hotel is perfect .
"Wow, the staff here never fail to deliver. This is our 5th stay at the Palace and it gets better every year. The service, the facilities, the award winning restaurants, the spa and the splendid pool are all amazing.   What's lovely is that the staff that we met when we first stayed here over 5 years ago are still around and they remembered us. Although this is not an obvious choice for those with young children, ours love this place and feel at home.   We had a little accident with our daughter who slipped in the shower and I cannot fault the attention we received as well as the medical care. They were so attentive and caring, I was almost embarrassed by the amount of calls and people checking on us.   This truly is the Indian Claridges if not better.   The only thing I would"
"Our stay at the Taj was above and beyond what we had imagined, it was perfect! Our room was incredible. We especially enjoyed the heritage tour and breakfast was AMAZING! All the staff were beautiful inside and out. Special shout-out to Dylan D'Souza for all of his help and kindness! We hope to come back! - Natasha and Erin "
"We stayed at the Taj in the Tower, room 1506.  Exquisite service, nice room, excellent breakfast.  Had high expectations and they were exceeded by our actual experience. Servers, front desk personnel, were outstanding. "
"If you are going to treat yourself or loved one to a stay here do stay in the old hotel building. Rooms overlooking the Gateway to India are superb with dawn sun over the sea. Our rooms included butler service, afternoon tea, canapes before dinner and cocktails, late night hot chocolate. Well worth it what a treat. Superb pool. Relaxed yet refined outdoor eating at lunchtime. Good food. Superb breakfast service. Security is high and efficient. Standards of service. decor, ambience are exceptional. But the atmosphere is relaxed and refined, friendly and amiable. A superb mix of quality with nothing too much trouble. Handy for sightseeing. We planned to stay a couple of nights but enjoyed a week here. Wonderful! Hard to beat but I'm still looking!!!!"
"Very large hotel, excellent staff and service. We stayed in the old building which has a lot of character. Nice pool area, the water temperature was a little warm for me but better too warm than cold. If you're looking for that special touch? try a smaller hotel, this place is just too big to really get the one on one type of care. Windows did not open due to mosquitoes but you could open with a key for emergencies. I found the room had a mildew smell from the air conditioning. Our butler (Dylan) was very helpful. "
Magnificent architecture with very attentive staff throughout. A wide range of first class eateries and easily within enjoyable walking distance of an historic area of Mumbai. Very much looking forward to my next trip to stay at your hotel.
"It is a treasured experience to stay at the Taj Mahal. Beautiful and classy. Hard to better the service. The food is exceptionally good. A relaxing, enriching experience, not in your face, very soft and subtle."
"Great overall experience. Housekeeping staff service were outstanding. My son's birthday was celebrated at the hotel and the staff and I simply mentioned this to the operator when I was enquiring about which restaurant would be ideal for a family celebration. The lady recommended The Golden Dragon and Masala Kraft. The call ended pleasantly. However, the Taj staff took note of my query and subsequently arranged balloons along with fruit and cookies in our room during the day and later in the evening a lovely cake was waiting for us along with 'Happy Birthday <son's name>' written on the tray in strawberry jam. We were impressed with this extraordinary service hence the 10 goes to housekeeping. We chose to celebrate the birthday at the Masala Kraft as it looked quite relaxing for"
"I checked in with four overseas guests in to two rooms in January 2017. The check in too late with most unhelpful staff. we asked for two interconnecting rooms, that we were not provided with. Bath room accessories were lacking, with no responsible person addressing the issues. Delayed news paper service to the rooms in the morning. Though too many staff run around, not much of quality service when needed. Quality of food not up to the mark. Over all, it is disappointing and not worth."
"Excellent Service throughout the hotel.  The hotel staff was most attentive, helpful, informative and very polite. The cuisine and the service at the restaurants visited, The Shamiana and The Sea Lounge, were great!"
"Great hotel and service !!  Nice atmosphere and facilities.  I really enjoyed the stay there.  Swimming pool is also great !!! Water front and close to Indian Gate.  Happy stay with great people !!!  I recommend to stay there, but a little bit expensive though....."
"I loved my room and the view from it. I loved the garden and the large pool w its deckchairs in cheerful colours. What a welcoming change to the usual boring grey and cream colours in most other places!! The terrace is elegant and stylish, the swing is cute, the pieces of art are well chosen and staff is v good despite the size of the hotel. Breakfast was huge, very tasty and also offering a number of healthy items. Next time I will definitely stay longer - decided!! :-)))"
"the taj mahal palace is an unbelievable creation in the world, i visited many places in india and met different people different cultural, all of them love this tajmahal palace. i invite you to come and see this wonder."
"I have been staying at the Taj Palace for 3 days and this short stay stands out as the most rewarding and memorable of a 2 months holiday throughout India. The spacious room was like a small apartment all to myself, with a separate space for a desk. The staff was most competent and obviously in the know on how to serve best the Hotel's well deserved reputation. I tried one of the 10 restaurants and here again, Bingo! If I was reviewing the restaurant for, say, the Michelin Guide, I would have given a minimum one star to the whole team working with so fine a result on my plates!"
We stayed at the Taj for our honeymoon and it was the best experience ever. The staff made our stay memorable from the word Go whether it was in terms of arrival reception or room decor to celebrate our wedding. The housekeeping and restaurant staff deserve a special mention. They remember guest names and preferences and little details. The restaurant manager presented us with a customised cake at breakfast to wish us bon voyage on the day of our departure. Everything about the hotel experience is incredible and well worth the money spent.
"All I can say is you cannot miss Tajness, it is overwhelming. From the start to end, really pampered to the fullest. Our child has taken a promise from us to come back very soon. We shall be back in May 2017 and hope to relive the experience."
"A beautiful old house, located in the perfect place near the India Gate. Old but first class in style and comfort.  Beautiful, large room and bathroom with nice furniture and marble and all there what you need for a perfect stay. It begins on the airport with a white dressed driver with white gloves, a relaxed afternoon on the huge, wonderful pool with excellent service and ends in the evening in one of the nice restaurants. Especially the Indian Restaurant was our favorite.  Highly recomended."
This is a prestigious hotel in a great location. The ambience is just right. The staff are extremely attentive polite and helpful. There is a wide variety of food available which is of excellently presented.
Yet again visiting this hotel was like 'coming home' I really love this place.  Indeed I love this place so much I frequently factor in a few days here just because I so enjoy it.  It is one of the few places in India I would feel totally relaxed about going to stay alone.  Lovely when staff recognise you too.
"We spent 3 nights in this palace and still have one night to go. But I could not wait to post my review. Where to start ? The hotel is superb, in special the old wing and the pool area. Service is at its best and all wishes are anticipated. Only few meters from the hotel you can admire the Gate of India and you're in walking distance from many touristic attractions and other museums. A must in Mumbai. Bravo !"
I stayed with my family. We stayed there for our anniversary celebrations and it was an amazing experience. The staff is too courteous and helpful. Food is excellent. We enjoyed and had a amazing experience. It was worth it. Taj experience is always exceptional.  I really wants to thank Taj team for their hospitality and effort taken to make their guest super special.
"The Gateway to India is the perfect place to start an Indian adventure. The iconic building which was completely renovated reopened in 2010 is on the sea and a five minute walk to the Arch. Security was noticeable but not in the least overbearing. We had a spacious, well appointed room overlooking the large pool. Our dinner at the Japanese restaurant Wasabi was exquisite. Service was superb. Breakfast was on the busy side, but delicious."
"Stayed here three nights in the palace wing, club level. Service from check in, butler service, restaurants, check out was spot on. The hotel has an amazing location, and is amazing itself. One evening after walking all day they brought my husband and myself rose water in copper soakers to soak our feet. Just A+ from beginning to end. Pool is a little small and lounges could be hard to get mid afternoon but the flora and fauna surrounding the pool was very nice. We would never stay anywhere else in Mumbai. Palace wing is a must!"
"Staff of hotel fantastic. Service superb. Suggest you  upgrade to Palace section of hotel which is over the top but such an experience. It is all to die for. All restaurants excellent.The icing on the cake was when they arrived one night to my room with big copper pots to soak our feet. Oh my, that was heavenly.  There were a dozen red roses in our room. Our steward who cleaned our room made a design of petals every day on the floor. Gorgeous. And he did lots of other special touches also.  This is the best hotel we have ever stayed at and we travel a great deal. We will be back."
"I've been staying in this hotel every time I visit India , but this time they did renovation so the rooms are a bit smaller and modern style , it looked really deferent  Services are really great  The location is perfect as it is a few steps away from lullaby street ( a famous street for shopping ) Staff are very professional and welcoming    It's an outstanding hotel "
i had a stay last weekend and must say that it feels to be staying in a heritage hotel with most beautiful restaurants.! must try palace wing stay..!!  we were given lat check in due to non availability of rooms. for this reason they gave us access to palace lounge which was very kind of them.!
"The breakfast was outstanding as was the service by Neeraj. I visited with a friend who was from out of town and wanted her to have traditional maharashtrian fare. So I asked if poha was on the breakfast buffet but was told it wasn't. In 15 minutes time, we were was pleasantly surprised to see Neeraj bringing us piping hot poha!! Everything on the buffet had the Taj stamp of excellence. Ask for seating by the window, the view is beautiful. "
"This is a truly unique experience and I would recommend it to anyone, even if you only stay for one-night. After doing a bit of research I decided to pay a little extra and stay in the palace wing which was everything and more! We had a sea view with views of the Gateway to India. The only thing I would recommend is that if you stay here, you should allow for time to spend in the hotel itself to use the facilities, which makes it worth the price tag.   When we arrived we went on the heritage walk around the hotel which was very interesting to learn about the hotel and it's history. The service was incredible, in the hour or so we were gone the host looking after our floor, had left flower petals in the room along with tidying up the mess I left behind (of his own accord). They"
This is a great hotel with great service and great food. From the moment of check in to the time we checked out we received incredible service. We got individual greetings and the staff was gracious and thorough. What ever we required the concierge  was able to achieve. This was a special place
"I loved the attendant gesture swimming pool, Gym, Hose keeping , check in office staff. Loved the hotel & people . The food served was delicious. The attendants at the food place were graceful. Choice of food was for all category of eaters. Very hygienic ."
it was amazing staying in this hotel. all staff were very friendly  and they greet you when they see you. they try to help you with smile. the reception staff upgrade our room from tower to the palace wing. i like this hotel. last year i was there too and this year . every time i will come to mumbai for sure i will book it.
"We stayed there for one night on leisure. This was the fourth Taj property we stayed at and with every stay, Taj raises our expectations and sets the bar even higher for other hotels and even other hotels in the Taj group. We had booked a room in the Tower Wing but on request were upgraded to the Palace Wing, much to our delight.Taj service is usually excellent and this was no exception. If anything, they were a notch higher than the precious properties we stayed in. All the staff made sure they acknowledge your presence even while crossing paths anywhere in the hotel and smile at you. The complimentary lounge served excellent coffee and cookies all day long. The outdoor swimming pool is wonderful as well. The hotel is so elegant and beautiful from the inside that you don't feel"
This is really a great place to stay in the hearth of South Mumbai...walking distance from the Gate of India and with great amenities.  You can enjoy food from everywhere in the world (great Lebanese restaurant too) and a great team always ready to assist and help you!  Enjoy.
I love this hotel. I really think it is the best hotel ever. Staff are attentive yet discrete. Prices are not silly. Good choice of restaurants and amazing breakfasts. Everything is perfect and as soon as I leave I start planning when I can go back!
"It is Situated near the Arabian sea.,u ll find all time cool weather here.All most all flight ( International and domestic ) land here. Train communication is also good from all corner of nation. The place is expensive for expensive people and cheap for cheap people."
"The Staff and the Service was impeccable. We stayed here to celebrate my mom's birthday, and everyone went above and beyond to celebrate her day. They even blew up balloons for her!  Coming from Luxembourg, I was unable to reach the hotel by phone due to a wrong landline listed on their website. I did bring this to the Hotel's attention and they were extremely gracious about it."
"Empty your pockets elsewhere.  The staff is phony, particularly the upper management.  The rooms are a shrivel, lacking any reflection of true Indian culture or heritage.  The food is below average for 5 Star prices. Taj has lost all of its original charm.  Where did it go?"
"Amazing hotel in Mumbai City. I realy recommend to everybody that come to visit Mumbai to stay at least one night in this hotel  A lot of restaurants options zing room service, nice pool and very good spa.  Expensive however absolutely amazing.   It was my best experience in an hotel. Everything was perfect."
"Taj mahal is really very very beautiful...We had a very helpful guide, shahid khan , who explain the history of taj mahal so clearly , we felt as if we were at that time of mongol. Shahid help us to do shoppings and also expkain how to avoid fake people. We spent a very memorable day in Agra. Thanx shahid khan. C u soon for another great experience in agra!"
I used to experience the beauty of Taj from outside but consider my lucky that i got chance to visit Taj today with my family. I just loved the beautiful architecture and carving. Despite of being old its damn beautiful and hope to visit again.
"As you would expect from most Taj hotels this is no exception, top notch five star hotel with great rooms and excellent service from a great team. It also has a good choice of Restaurants, great for business and families"
Flawless attention to detail.  Spectacular eye-catchinging decor.  Every single employee is dedicated to ensuring a wonderful experience.  Mr. Wasim Shaikh at the front desk is particularly wonderful and really sets the tone for a fabulous stay.
An iconic hotel. Beautiful building inside and out. The room impressive and well appointed. The service good and attentive although a little impersonal. The restaurants were expensive and the non ethnic rather a limited menu. Breakfast excellent with a great view of the harbour.  A special place to stay because of its fame and history. 
Excellent stay experience. Courteous staff and the food is superb.Worth staying.The property is awesome. Well maintained decor and ambience. Good value for money. The restaurants are also very nice and hygienic.
Difficult to fault this hotel which sets the standard - inside and outside India. It combines excellence of amenity with dignity and warmth of atmosphere - thanks largely to staff selection and training which is unparalleled anywhere.
"I was born in Bombay. I've lived there for the first 20 years of my life and only experience the beauty and grandeur of this hotel from the outside.  I later moved to the Middle East and now live in Canada.  I visit Bombay (my birthplace) almost every other year and decided last year to experience this hotel from the inside.  It is one of the oldest and the best luxury hotels in Mumbai, the Taj Mahal hotel is sight worth watching. The beautiful architecture, striking landscapes and the view is spectacular, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is another tourist attraction of the city. For those who are planning to visit Mumbai for a short vacation, you can opt to stay here for a luxurious and pampered experience. It is one of India’s finest hotels with over 500 rooms and 40 suites that"
"I heard some members from my group say, ""Taj is Taj"" when describing the extraordinary standards of service that we experienced.  I was not surprised.    The front office was welcoming, understated, and very efficient.  The concierge service very proactive.  Restaurant service was outstanding and the quality and variety of food in the restaurants was delightful.  And what delighted me, personally, more than anything else, was the outstanding banquet service coordinated by Akshay, Krish, and their teams.  Our requirements are very demanding and can test the patience of the staff.  But here, there was cheerful and efficient support throughout.  The quality of rooms, however, was a little disappointing.  While the bed linen was comforting, the pillows were rather hard and pillow"
"I had an early flight out of Mumbai airport having driven down from Poona and had choice of hotel close to airport or going ""Downtown"" and staying at probably the best hotel in India the Taj Palace next to the ""Gateway to India"" No contest the Taj wins every time and a taxi from the rank opposite the Hotel is an easy and cheap route to the airport and at 4.00 am there is no traffic. Nothing touches the sevice at the Taj"
"What an amazing place. The beauty and history are indescribable. We hired a guide to take us through the grounds and tell us about everything. This was also helpful, in that we got to skip the long lines. Definitely well work the small cost. Remember that everything in India is negotiable. The Taj Mahal is a must see in India!"
"Not to be confused with the Taj Mahal, Taj Mahal Palace is located in Mumbai not in Agra.  However, this hotel is almost as iconic as the world famous mausoleum that it was named after.  The hotel is full of old world charm.  If your room is in the old section of the hotel, you can take the elevators next to the central dome to reach your floor.  The floor plan of the building is basically in the shape of letter C or a square with one side missing.  The corridor of the hallway is extra wide as sky light from the roof distill day light down to hallways below.  I imagine this was an effective way for the hotel to save electricity back in the day and today as well!  There are a total of 5 floors plus ground floor or in the US it would be noted as the building has a total of 6"
"I would like to thank all of the staff I met during my stay at Taj Mahal Palace, it was one of my dream Hotel to stay. I was overwhelmed by the service and , amazing breakfasts and bar. walking distance to shopping center nearby, not far from The Gateway of India you must visit.I loved my experiencedHotel."
Had Delicious Indian food at Shamiana.... everything about this place is best...awesome ambience! You should try the authentic Kheema Pav... the lovely architecture and the ambenience makes it the best place to hang out for a scrumptious dinner.
Had an early morning flight so needed to make the decision of airport hotel or the Taj downtown. The Taj is a fabulous hotel in the very best location and much to our surprise at 4 am it is a short quick and cheap taxi ride to the airport. The Taj wins hands down
This hotel is situated in mumbai. It has 560 rooms and 11 resturants. It has 7 floors. The hotel hosts many programes. It is situated near the gateway of india. It is built by TATA In the year 1903 dec 16.
The charm of old world heritage structure with the efficiency required by the modern day traveler is seen and unobtrusively perceived in this grand hotel. It is interesting to understand the evolution of the hotel over the years. Great works of art by Indian masters compel us to take time out to appreciate them in middle of a hectic schedule. Excellent food in excellent settings with excellent service - be it the Pool side or the Roof top. No wonder this hotel symbolizes the city of Mumbai with its indomitable spirit!
Truly a great hotel. Service and attention to detail  was wonderful. A standard lost by most others. Look forward to my next visit.  Perfect position and restaurants were all first class. Staff were proud to share their Indian culture and cuisine. 
"The Taj Mahal in Mumbai is iconic sea-facing landmark. This hotel offers splendid views of the Arabian Sea and Gateway of India, alongside refined hospitality. Room service has a wide range and cuisine, and the delivery time is reasonable. Breakfast selection is sumptuous.  Food is great at Souk. Sea facing room is recommended."
"Hotel Taj Palace hotel. Very impressed with this hotel.  The staff were lovely as well as efficient. The room was beautiful overlooking the Gate.  Spent an afternoon around the pool relaxing after our journey.  Beautiful pool with wires to stop the flocks of local pigeons.  Ate in the Cafe type restaurant, good choice of menu.  Breakfast was the most elaborate affair ,catering  for all nationalities. The staff encourage you to try some local dishes and are very attentive.  Wished we could have stayed longer."
"This is a hotel steeped in popular history and the many photographs adorn the walls throughout the hotel, telling its colourful story.  It's a great hotel that is difficult to fault  Definitely hooked.  I hope you enjoy it too."
"I only spent two night in this hotel after a week in Goa .Have wanted to stay in the Taj Palace for years and it was everything and more that I expected it to be. From Check In Reception, Bell Boy ,Housekeeping Staff,Waiters they were totally focused on the comfort and wellbeing of the guest. Food was probably the best I have ever tasted . I did not want to leave and will go back ASAP"
Stayed for three nights had a wonderful experience variety of restaurants offering quality n tasty food very good service nice room and nice ambience. Nice view f rooms  staff very courteous and cooperative 
"This is how the Taj was described to me by a fellow, much-travelled guest on the first day of our short stay, and he wasn't wrong.  It was a special family occasion for us, my wife's first-ever return to the city of her birth, celebrating a significant birthday. As soon as the staff realised this, they upgraded us from the adequate but unexciting annexe to a palatial suite the size of a small house in one wing of the old hotel. The view of the Gateway of India dominating the Arabian Sea, framed by our Mughal-style arched windows, was stunning. They continued to exceed all our expectations by giving my wife a complementary session of Mehndi (henna hand-painting) and a haircut and restyling - all offers of tips refused - along with a number of other personal and very meaningful"
My stay at the Taj was one I will never forget. I stayed for 2 nights and did not want to leave. The care taken in every moment you are there is evident and it was one of my most memorable stays ever.   The staff were fantastic and incredibly welcoming. I was in the palace wing which was a dream come true and every inch of my stay was amazing. I did the hotel tour and it was so great to hear about the rich history of this magnificent hotel.   The Taj made my Mumbai stay one to remember and I cannot wait to go back! 
"The Taj Mahal Palace hotel is on the waterfront near the Gate of India monument in Mumbai central. After some damage in 2008 it has been renovated and is more opulent than ever.   Fairly chaotic at entry as the taxi parked on the street to let us out as he could not access the hotel. We dragged our bags across the road and were met by the hotel staff who whisked us through to check-in. Fairly busy at check-in and we waited 15 minutes to be served. This was a running theme through my stay as it took 50 minutes at the desk to get our bill organised and sorted and paid.   The rooms are divine - great decor, very comfortable bed. I loved the shower (large rain shower head) and the study desk was comfortable to work on my laptop at.   I used the in laundry service and left my laundry"
we have a wounder stay at this hotel . It was of great services .  Over all everything was good apart from matter of one point of contact . they have provided us the a complimentary birthday cake for my child . Over all experiences was excellent.
"We booked this hotel as a stopover on the way back home to UK as a special treat for our family ( 7 rooms ) On arrival we were delighted to be told we had been given an upgrade to room 265......... However The room we were given did not have the Seaview we booked ,And it stank of cigar smoke There was no Seaview and no balcony  We complained and then offered a poolside room , still no  Seaview  We then insisted on having our originally booked a room which the manager was able to arrange for us , hence 3* (I would have given lower otherwise ) she handled our complaint well  Out of the 7 rooms only 2 were OK I feel we have wasted our first afternoon   My daughter even had a room with no window! Hardly an upgrade from the sea view  She burst into tears   Very disappointed but now"
Service is excellent with some fine restaurants.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Souk and the Golden Dragon.  Pool is very well maintained and again service is lovely allowing you to simply relax. Very highly recommended.
"A stay at the Taj is a must if you visit Mumbai, or Bombay as the locals still prefer to call it. It is pure luxury but with style. The staff are a class above any other I have ever encountered, nothing was a problem. The breakfast is amazing and the service in the dining room outstanding. The tariff is reasonable too, especially for what you get."
"I am a seasoned traveller, and this is an AMAZING hotel! We were very well looked after from the moment we arrived to the time we checked out. The hotel is a masterpiece and the staff are incredibly attentive. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
"It has always been a pleasure to stay with the Taj group hotels and they are very close to our heart. We decided to experience the hospitality of this iconic property en route our home and it was the best decision we could have taken to spend few days in Mumbai before our actual holiday began!! We booked a sea view room at the tower wing but was upgraded to the more magnificent Palace wing (thank you Shabaaz). Right from the airport pick up at 0430 in the morning till we departed this place, we enjoyed every moment spent here. The hotel itself is no short than a museum of hospitality and the keepers ensure that all the efforts to its finest details are fulfilled to make it a memory for everyone entering through the lobby.  After a warm welcome we were taken to our room (up on"
"I am not used to that kind of luxury, care and attention in a hotel. An oasis in the middle of Chaos! Not my kind of interior design but luxurious and grandeur is there. the staff are lovely. everything was just perfect"
"This hotel is outstanding!  For hours you sit in Mumbai's awful traffic and the constant, irritating and pointless hooting from the millions of cars on the road and finally you reach this palace.  You walk in and all of a sudden its quite, its peaceful and its just majestic!!  Its beautiful!  You are instantly greeted by staff, check in process is remarkably fast.  The thing that's put this hotel above the rest for me personally was the service!  No hotel has come this close to the level of detail they put into looking after you.  Some of the staff are so good, they remember your name and welcome you back each time you get back to the hotel.  The rooms are in fantastic condition and the beds are just so nice to sleep in!  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.  Its also"
A group of friends and I dressed in our best saris and took the trip to Agra from Jaipur. This was one for the romance books.A beautiful moseleum for a heartbroken King lamenting the death of his queen.  This is a must see if you are in the area. It's.one of the wonders of the world!
"This by far is the best hotel in Bombay, maybe in India,  The ""Old Taj"" as it is known has the old world charm with lovely rooms and lobbies.  Even though I do not stay there when i visit Bombay, I have to go visit it just to enjoy the grandeur.  It is a MUST SEE."
It is always a great pleasure to stay at the Taj. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in by far. Looking forward to my next stay at this magnificent historical hotel. Thank you so much for the pleasingly different experience
"I have always wondered as to how a hotel can get even more fancy after a certain point. What is there that makes one hotel standout more over the other. After staying here for a night, I understood why this is Mumbai's finest hotel.  The entire hotel staff works like well-oiled machinery and always looking at making the stay pleasurable. The entire hotel is more designed to be catered to non-indians. Right from the 'traditional Indian welcome' to the ambience and decor of the hotel, it is not modern in any sense but more of a heritage hotel with some new-age touches.  I found the rooms a little under-whelming. Although it was very well done up and pretty, it again is a design that would appeal to someone who is not familiar to Indian tastes. The room in itself was not charming"
"Being from Mumbai itself we decided to treat ourselves to a luxurious sojourn at the Taj Mahal, Mumbai. We booked ourselves a room in the tower wing and at check in we were upgraded to a sea facing room from a city facing room. The room was delightful with a small balcony facing the Gateway of India and the Harbor. The check in was smooth and we were welcomed in the traditional Indian Style. The room had all the amenities a five star room should have and what it did not have they were only to happy to provide us in the room. We had a 'first of a kind' tea buffet in their Sea Lounge. It was an amazing buffet with sandwiches and pastries along with numerous beverages. For dinner, we tried the Golden Dragon and the food there was exceptional. Since we were with a toddler they gave"
"As professional and polished as one would expect from the flagship of India’s Tata business empire. No waiting around for attention - 800 staff are on duty at any one time, which generally works out at a staff member for every guest. Extra flourishes in the palace wing include 24-hour personal butler service and an in-house Vedic astrologer. There are also no fewer than 15 yoga and meditation classes to choose from, a private jet on standby at four hours notice, and a luxury yacht."
I stay for 3 night with my family in the palace part  The room was comfortable large (little bit smelly) there is a private butler for the room and each floor you can ask him for anything you want  The breakfast was very rich Indian food and international food And the service was excellent  Pool area really nice good food also in this part of the hotel  ‏ the hotel area it's nice is  located near the gate of India and the boat to Elephants islands Behind the hotel it's Culaba Street Food restaurant coffee and some shopping It is highly recommended!
"I am writing a tripadvisor review after 4 years now as I don't bother to write due to busy life/work. We stayed in taj last week our stay was opulent if you want to be treated like a royal taj mahal palace is the place to go. From arrival to departure the service was excellent. We were checked into our room within 15 min. We stayed in the palace part of the hotel  Very clean spacious rooms and bathroom. Excellent clean pool  area and spa/ changing rooms. Gorgeous spread of Breakfast , excellent crockery ( le creuset pans and villeroy and boch cutlery). The most impressive thing was that the staff took care of little things like keeping a spectacle cleaning cloth under my specs, a puzzle and colouring books and crayons for my little girl, a liner for my makeup etc. They also made"
"We enjoyed a great lunch after returning from Elefant Island in their garden restaurant on the ground floor. Excellent food (large portions, so don't order too much) and very good service. A really nice and quite heaven in the middle of the craziness of Mumbai."
"From beginning to end, the experience at the Taj Mahal Palace was wonderful. The staff were exceptional; around every corner there was someone with a greeting and a smile. The room was lovely, and the attention to detail in the customer service was incredible. I had heard that it was a great hotel, but it far surpassed my expectations. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel (Golden Dragon) was excellent, and they mix a mean cocktail in the Harbour Bar. I want to live there!"
"From the moment of arrival to departure was nothing but pleasurable. The staff are beautifully presented, attentive and pay close attention to detail. The concierge very helpful, the drivers as knowledgable about the city as any tour guide and the food was delish! The rooms immaculate, clean and very comfortable.  I would recommend this experience for anyone staying in Mumbai.  The hotel stay is well worth the money but be aware to factor in to your budget additional taxes.  "
"I can heartily recommend this hotel - I was on a leisure visit and the location in such an enormous city is hard to beat. The building is majestic externally and is exquisitely designed and decorated internally. Standards of service and attention to detail are in my experience outstanding. Rooms are extremely comfortable and well looked after, the restaurants serve first class food and service is impeccable. I had some work to finish while there and the Business Centre is well equipped and staff were very helpful and efficient."
"This is  very famous iconic hotel around the world. Very busy with tourist, staff greet you with Indian tradition. Guided tour of hotel, many good shops. All staff around hotel are very helpful and eager to help you. Great place to stay."
Staying in the new wing I had amazing room service and this hotel was my first taj hotel now when I travel anywhere in India I stay in taj hotels only. The front desk service was amazing we had requested them to book a restaurant and movie for us and they did it.I am looking forward to visit this hotel.
"This has to be the best hotel I have ever stayed in not just because of the standard of the rooms etc but because of the welcome and care taken of you by all the staff. After staying here for 5 days I will miss them.  As other guests  have mentioned walking back into the cool,elegant lobby after a day sightseeing is such a joy. The pool is wonderful you can easily swim your km or just snooze in the shade. The breakfast buffet is extensive, some of the foods there I would consider lunch so whatever time zone your stomach still thinks it is in you will be satiated. The staff will explain any dishes you are not familiar with, different dishes appear each morning so cannot get bored. If you are travelling alone then I recommend the Sea Lounge for eating, go for a window table and"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is located next to the famous Gate to India in Mumbai. Hotels can be very hit or miss in India, but the Taj has a rich history as the place to stay. They have pictures of famous people who have stayed at the hotel throughout the years, from Royalty, Presidents, Heads of States and even rock legends like the Beetles. The garden in the rear is incredibly tranquil and an ideal location for an evening cocktail. My teenage son accompanied me on this business trip and it was his birthday. The he concierge arranged for a special birthday card, balloons and a piece of cake to be in our room on arrival without me even requesting it. Service is a five. Some areas of the hotel are a bit older and probably rate a four. The hotel prides itself on its history both good"
Had a fantastic high tea in Sea Lounge of the Taj Mahal Palace. The hotel is opulent and high tea was served by window seat with views of the Gate of India and harbour. Food selection was extensive and service was quick and friendly. Would definitely recommend it.
Excellent. We loved the food we had and even my family had great time. My son loved the non veg. Ours vist was for the first time and would love to visti other locations of taj all over the India. Only Problem is there should be more activities for children
A must if visiting Mumbai. The sanctuary within the 4 walls of this hotel oasis is a welcome rest bite after a day of sight seeing in Mumbai.  If I ever visit Mumbai again there will be no doubt as to where I shall be staying.
"This is a really special one !!! Even among the great hotels of India...and the world...The Taj Mahal Palace,  Mumbai is the gold standard. Guest Indulgence is on multiple levels....the accommodation in the Tower wing is decent..mbut the old Palace section accommodations are just beautiful and most offer fantastic views of the Gateway of India and the Sea..The decor in the Tower section in modern and the Palace section is in opulant vibrant pastels...The central dome and the grand staircase is a treat to see...Original Indian Masters are hung on the Lounge walls and other common areas : Raza, Hussain, Ara, Souza, Sabawala...just a cultural treat....Food in all the restaurants is top quality...Masala Kraft, Wasabi, Sea Lounge and the Souk on the 20th floor of the Tower"
"There is always scope for improvement, but in the case of Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai, I cannot find any scope to improve. Its at its pinnacle. Just do not go down! And why am I not surprised! It's the Tata Brand. The best in the business!"
This iconic hotel is a fabulous place to stay in Mumbai with exceptional service from everyone.  The location by the Gateway to India is perfect for sightseeing in Mumbai.  The breakfast in the Sea Lounge was beyond belief....really exceptional.  I highly recommend staying here for the most enjoyable hotel stay possible in Mumbai.
"everything top class, absolutely no complaints, expensive but worth it, service was excellent, entire staff was ever-smiling and ready to help, morning buffet was great and they accepted a-la-carte demands as well. overall very happy with the experience."
"My husband and spent 3 weeks in Goa to celebrate his 60th and my forthcoming birthday and that is when we decided to fly into Mumbai and stay in the Taj Mahal Palace. We contemplated which room would suit us and decided on the Club Room and stayed for 3 nights 4 days. The experience for us both was breathtaking and memorable and will stay with us for the rest of our life. From being picked up by a chaffeur at the airport, having your own private butler, beautiful breakfast, high tea, cocktails and after dinner drinks whoooo we were in heaven!. The best thing about the Taj in our opinion although this is seen as the best hotel in India and we have stayed in many and is a 5 star it has not lost its warmth which exudes from the staff.....the ambience of what India represents and"
"We stayed for two nights at the end of our busy two week touring holiday and so glad we did, it was luxurious. Everything was perfect from checking in to checking out. We upgraded to a room in the heritage part (I didn't realise there was a tower wing which was another hotel originally and incorporated into the main hotel) as our travel agent hadn't told us we were in the tower. I'm so glad we did-it was worth the extra to have the experience. The building itself is so beautiful and interesting. The room was spacious and very comfortable with a lovely bed and everything you could possibly need. The bathroom is all marble with a very deep bath and separate shower-all perfect. Breakfast is vast-if you can't find anything you like you are very picky! The pool and beds are"
"We were not sure about the costs but we knew that it a kind of upper level hotels in our country.  The services provided in hotel were exceptionally best so far i have been in any hotel. Whether it may be rooms, corridors, food all almost at their best. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are coming to Mumbai. "
"The best city hotel I have ever stayed in. More a palace really, with palace level service. The corridors are more an art gallery, the Palace lounge is  fantastic and our suite was truly unbelievable. A most wonderful weekend for leisure. The location is unbeatable, right opposite the Gateway of India and close to the atmospheric Colaba precinct."
"스토리가 있는 역사적 장소라는 이유만으로도 충분히 방문할 가치가 있었다고 생각했었습니다. 투숙해서 3박 4일을 보내면서 서비스 편안함 모든 면에서 세계 어느 호텔에서도 경험하지 못한 즐거움을 맛보았습니다. 웰컴 세레모니부터 시작해서 모든 직원들이 항상 고객을 '보살피고 도우려' 애쓴다는 느낌을 받았습니다. Sea Lounge에서 라이브피아노를 들으며 애프터눈티(실제로 뷔페라 엄청 먹었지만)를 즐기고, 풀사이드에서 책보다가 바베큐에 맥주 한잔 해도 좋습니다.  가능하면 Tower보다 Palace에 묵을 것을 권합니다.   More than excellent.  I've stayed for 3 nights and I didn't want to leave. I know it's expensive comparing to other Hotels in India but deserve to pay it. You may take a view of the Arabian Sea and enjoy afternoon tea(actually quiet heavy buffet) in the Sea Lounge listening live piano playing.  Most of all staffs!  From the very start(welcoming ceremony) to the farewell, all the guys working in the Hotel are so warm and thirsty for devotion to helping guest.  They call India Incredible, I"
Being in Mumbai we decided to book a room in the old part of the Hotel. We do think that this was a very good decision. The room overlooking the harbor with a marble bath is in some way more than we can afford. Nevertheless we enjoyed every moment and did not leave the room until we had to. From the first moment the staff was more than helpful and supporting. Although electricity broke down the electrician was with us right away and solved the problem. Go there and if its only for one time.
A superb Hotel in the business city surrounded with many tourist attractions and has story for every corner of the hotel. However the choice of BF is not as per the hotel standard in our view and as compare to other hotels nearby.
Our stay was perfection from start to finish - being met at Mumbai airport to our reluctant departure. This is one of the world's great hotels.  Having stayed in three other Taj hotels during our trip we thought they couldn't get any better. How wrong we were. Drinking cocktails overlooking the Gateway  to India was a fantastic farewell to our trip. The pool and Aquarius dining area was perfect for a lazy afternoon after a morning's sightseeing. The bars are great fun (we tried them all) - and they even had a Happy Hour. The serenity in such a large cosmopolitan city was truly wonderful. Thank you Taj Hotels - we will be back.
"Amazingly located, with great charm and amenities, right in the heart of most tourist spots. The heritage hotel is extremely well preserved. The choice of cuisine is amazing with a number of restaurants."
"Hotel was super clean, staff was fantastic, breakfast was excellent especially at the sea lounge. I felt secure all the time. Finally my room was great and spacious despite no window except frosted window in the washroom. Next time I will ask for a room with a window."
"Booked the Taj Palace hotel for a holiday for my wife and me, we stayed for 9 nights and 8 days.  What can you say,; great location, excellent service, super service.  We stayed at the palace side, the rooms are big, clean with a bath and a shower. Breakfast at the sea lounge, the view of the Gateway of India and the sea while having breakfast. The staff Cannot do enough for the guest with a smile.  The pool is great, also have a great rules of no towels on beds can be left in attended for 20 minutes.  Choice of restaurants, we only ate at Wasabi. Which was very good, they use ""fresh"" wasabi! The vegetarian wasabi are very nice.  Special mention of the staff, they are so courteous, friendly, helpful.  "
"The Taj is defined as the last word in graciousness. This was amply shown by all the family members, We prefer adressing all of them as our family members rather than just ""staff"" as we felt we were with our own family.They were the epitome of The Taj. We enjoyed the heritage tour and were highly impressed with traditions at The Taj, one of them being lighting of the lamps at sunset. We were awestruck by the architecture and more important what The Tatas have done with it."
Average.  1. Long check in process 2. The person attending was not aware of membership details. 3. Hospitality in general lacked that mark. 4. Goof up at check out 5. Not accomodating even to Gold epicure member 6. The tour was good and the girl was well versed.
"This hotel is world famous and if you book a room in the heritage wing it gives a very good flavour of past grandeur. You need to book a room with a sea view, on to the Gate of India.  Hotel is used for both business as well as private travel, but tends to cater more for the business market.  Has a very good outdoor swimming pool/bar area which is a real bonus."
"We booked a 3 night stay to get an introduction to Mumbai ...... wanted something a bit ""special"". The Taj has 2 wings, the old Palace (built 1903) and the new tower (built in the 1970's) We got an ""upgrade""to the Palace and the excitement began Highlights..... Traditional genuine Indian welcome by reception staff on check in and personal guide to room. Beautiful room with antique furniture but modern fit out (after 2008 bombings ......) Personal touches such as flower petals and gifts each night. Several TOP quality restaurants that meant little incentive to explore Mumbai cuisine ... Excellent service at all turns including Patrick who insisted on serving traditional Indian breakfast each morning .... Great pool and eclectic clientele (love ya Jim and Rita from Tipperary!)"
"The Taj Mahal Palace has a magnificent position and the original building is spectacular  -matched by the quality of the service. Worth paying the extra to get a room with a sea view; very little street noise and extremely comfortable and you get the benefit of complimentary high tea, pre-dinner cocktails & post-dinner chocolates ( I took advantage of the first two, served with style in the lounge). This place is an experience in itself."
"the taj mahal palace is located opposite the gateway of india, overlooking the arabian sea. it comprises of the initial palace wing and a newer wing which is more contemporary. the hotel is located in south mumbai and is quite close to the commercial hubs in the city. i visited the hotel for a conference which was held in the crystal room (located on the 1st floor of the palace wing). the room is well done, absolutely no faults u can find. service and arrangements were seamless. food was delicious, especially their desserts - too good!"
"We went there on our Mumbai Trip. It was our fourth time stayed at Taj Mahal Mumbai.  The hotel location is perfect, in the centre of the shopping street. And in front of Gateway of India.  We loved their concierge service desk, when we need cardboards for our things, they were able to provide it and even helped us packed our things and send it to our car.  Highly appreciated the effort they did to made us happy. Mumbai is a hectic city with lots of vehicle horns, but at a step we enter this hotel, we feels relaxed, the breakfast is very well.  Suprisingly the room service gave us a set of foot bath and foot salt in the room in our last night.  Definately will stay there again when I visit Mumbai City. "
"Stayed for 3 nights in the Palace Wing. The whole hotel is incredible, but the Palace Wing is like a sanctuary.   The pool and gym are great for an afternoon refresh and the hotel is ideally located for exploring.   A truly superb experience at one of the most iconic hotels in the world."
"This hotel could easily be one of the best hotels in the world. I mean look at the ambiance, location, interiors and use of the technology to make is as guest friendly as possible. I was impressed with the suite, amenities, placement of exotic fruits, high end toiletries and prompt butler service. Took a tour of Mumbai and Afroz ( chauffeur) did an amazing job in explaining the sights & driving in Mumbai traffic. Beauty during the breakfast service was great in paying attention to the minutest details.  A must visit to everyone travelling to Mumbai."
Had some initial noise problems that were immediately and very competently addressed by management.  Was offered change in room and other amenities gratis for the trouble.  To me the Taj chain is the very best in service and quality both in London and India ...
If ever one is looking for a stay which will be etched in your memory forever it has to be The Mahal Palace Mumbai. The Place has history and modernity combine dand cloaked in itself its The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Its location and the friendly staff can make anyone their fans for ever. No need to even emphasizing on the high standards which are 200% above average. A huge thumbs up for my stay there.
"If there is a better hotel anywhere on this planet, I'd like to know. The service from the front desk to the cleaning crew to the valet is other worldly.   Since my first overnight stay here a few years ago, I always make it a point to return whenever I'm in Bombay. The hotel managers and staff go that  extra mile to make you feel at home, whether you are staying at a regular room in the tower, or a palatial suite. Whether it's the personal touches they provide, like remembering your name whenever you return to a restaurant, or going above and beyond the call of duty to  address any concerns you may have, the service here makes it clear that this hotel enjoys rarefied air. On this last visit I was in a very comfortable room, but they upgraded me to a suite  through most of my"
We spent six nights at the Taj Mahal Palace and what a wonderful experience it was.  We had arranged with the Hotel a chauffeur pick up at the airport.  Upon leaving arrivals we were greeted by name by an employee of the Hotel who introduced us to the chauffeur (beautifully dressed in uniform and white gloves).  There was water in the back of the SUV for us.  The ride to the hotel was very informative as the driver explained lots of things whilst we were travelling.  When we arrived at the hotel we were again greeted by name and shown into the hotel lobby where we were informed we had been upgraded from the Tower to the Palace Wing and then given the traditional welcome (I have forgotten what they call this).  As this was a special trip I had many questions for the hotel prior
"I have probably been in India 50 times, but this was first time in Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. I had very high expectations before my arrival, and all my expectations has been met and more than that supriced me.  We where so lucky to be upgraded to a suite, and the feeling being guest in a palace was so met staying in that room.  The hotel gives you an ambience filled with being a part of history. A colonien style, a luxery and friendlyness from staff that is quite unique.  Swiming pool, is huge, and with the sourounding garden with its deep chairs is such a beutiful place.  I highly recommend a stay in Taj Mahal Palace it gives you a positive energy,...and you basically forget its a world outside   General score where 10 is excellent:  Rooms: 10 Location: 10 Food; 10 Pool: 9 Spa: 9"
"What a Palace! We had high expectations and it did not disappoint. Our room in the Palace wing was perfection, everything a very high standard, the bedding, the furniture, the beautiful marble bathroom (a shame someone can't fit power sockets straight but that's my highly critical eye). The view was amazing, watching sunrise over The Gateway of India was a perfect way to start everyday. We preferred having breakfast outside at the Aquarius restaurant, very calm, not as busy, not as much choice but served what we wanted. The service and surroundings was impeccable. A beautiful pool area where we spent more time than expected as so relaxing. In fact we didn't venture far at all in our three days in Mumbai as we wanted to make the most of what this iconic hotel had to offer, which"
"I have stayed 3 nights at this Hotel , at the old wing. All I can say  its keeping its old charm and in all levels of service, its fantastic. Had a dinner at the İndian restaurant one night and also at the Chinese restaurant  and both was very good. The room was overlooking to the İndia gate but still very quite . Would like to stay there next time also."
"we were given the most amazing welcome by wonderfully friendly and helpful staff who continued to excel in every way and made our stay truly memorable. Good food, comfortable room, lovely swimming pool area but most of all excellent customer service and of course a great location"
"the welcome as soon as we got out of the taxi was wonderful, all the reception team were so friendly and made us feel very special the service was impeccable, even poolside where we were brought chilled water and fruits we ate in the restaurant and the food was great too!"
"IF you wise to Pamper yourself, The Taj Mahal Hotel & Palace is the place ... From our arrival to departure, we felt soooo special. Amazing Ambiance, fantastic food, really courteous staff ... Best place to relax over a weekend."
"We were located in the old section in a Deluxe Harbor View room.  The rooms and lovely with a little raised sitting area with a view of the Gateway of India.  Very comfortable bed, makeup mirror, hair dryer, good water pressure and hot water, coffee maker, mini fridge with wide selection, upscale amenities, bathrobe, both a tub and a shower, excellent housekeeping. Spa and pool available.   Choice of many restaurants; we ate in the sushi restaurant which was excellent, but high priced because all fish is imported.  Reservations required.  We had lunch at the top of the new tower, great salad and hummus, but ambiance not as fancy as sushi restaurant. We did the tour of the hotel, which honestly was a little boring."
"Despite this hotel’s enviable reputation, I was disappointed, as it didn’t achieve the standards I hoped for and expected. Service was Ok (at best) and was generally only offered if the staff member delivering it was presented with a sizable tip (which they stood and waited for, until given). The Hotel is undoubtedly beautiful and impressively lavish but it seems to cater best for visiting businessmen, rather than tourists. Finally, the Hotel’s security policy makes it a bit of a fortress - nowadays; one enters from a side door, as the main entry point is totally closed-off.  The Hotel offers many dining options but we only ate at one (The Indian restaurant), which, in our opinion, was over-priced for an average meal. Would I return – ‘NO’."
"Needless to say, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel situated at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai is one of its kind! Its a monument in itself! The property has a legacy spanning more than a hundred years! It is the outcome of the enterprise of our visionary JRD Tata! Hats off, salute and a heart-felt Namaskar to this visionary man who not only created this Palace Hotel but also so many other industries! He is the Guardian Angel Entrepreneur of Modern India!  The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is made with beautiful marble and other building materials! It also houses so many beautiful paintings!! The staff is very courteous and the service impeccable!! Even a short stay at this palace hotel gives us modern day commoners a glimpse of an Royal Experience! A place definitely worth visiting again and again!!"
"This was my first time staying in the Tower wing of the hotel so I was a bit apprehensive as to whether it would be as good as the Palace wing  Check in was quick and efficient despite the small queue in the early afternoon  The room was on a higher floor with wonderful views . It had been recently refurbished - very bright and airy with a king size bed , desk area and comfortable armchair . There was lots of cupboard and storage space . An iron and ironing board were provided . The room was brightly lit . The bathroom had a walk in shower and no bath - also very spacious , with nice Forest Essentials amenities . There were lots of big fluffy white towels . Service at the front desk /concierge was always courteous and helpful . The restaurant service ( Shamiana) at both"
it is situated in heart of Bombay specially the tajland specially the gate way of india where many tourist from all over come to visit the seight seeing and stop to for food the place is really nice palce
"Always heard about Taj that taj considered always best at anyhow or any cost and I saw that hospitality here during people comes into taj & staff welcoming them. The standard of taj which hold by quality & hospitality, otherwise taj and other hotels, does not have any competitors.   "
"For a romantic staycation in Mumbai, no better hotel comes to mind than the Taj Palace in Colaba. The location is stunning. However, once we got off the elevator and walked to our room, the hallways looked old and dates, the paint colour chipping off. the room to continued with that. The bare minimum facilities. Gone was the feeling of being pampered in luxury. The breakfast buffet was chaotic and felt canteen like. Was very noisy and clamourous.  But what worked was the location, Step out and there are million places to dine at. Love walking around Colaba."
"Spent only one night here as part of a tour of India. We were expecting great things from an iconic hotel  & we were not disappointed.  Faultless.   The service, as I  have come to expect from the Taj Hotels group, was second to none.  Wonderful breakfast buffet & service. Lovely spacious room with a view of the Gateway to India.  It was expensive, especially the drinks but you get what you pay for! "
"Absolutely brilliant in all respects especially the ambience, food & service offered by the hotel . The transfers are wonderful & provide broadband services with competent drivers to give you information about the landmarks, The comfortable Mercedes hire for eight hours to tour the city with an extremely knowledgeable driver/tour guide  together with broadband facilities on board are the best way to see the city in its entirety."
The Taj Team succeed to meet and  exceed the expectations of their guest. They showcase their passion for  excellence and delivers highest  standards of integrity and fairness.  Our stay with the Taj Heritage wing was not just classic but was truly experiential of great hospitaltity.
"Wonderful stay at this hotel..As expected from this hotel group, experience was even better than earlier visits. The hotel reception, all other staff.. just make you feel it a royal treat.  Would share the feedback with my friends too, and request them to use the facilities and experience bliss.."
"Beautiful hotel in a culturally rich city. Hotel has an amazing presence and history. Service is amazing, rooms are beautiful and comfortable - views from the tower section are unforgettable. Located in a bustling part of the city - Awesome hotel!"
"We went to the Sea Lounge, which offers a beautiful view. The hotel is quite nice but the service at the Lounge was not up to par: we got the impression that because we were not ordering food, we were not ""interesting"" for the staff.  It took more than 20 minutes before someone came to take our order and as long to get our drinks."
"TI have stayed here 10 years ago but the hotel service , the entrance to the palace wing and everything became very very bad. The people working only for tip and they almost force you to give a tip. My agency did a surprise in my suite for my birthday .. before even I enter and see the surprise the bell boy told me that they did a surprise etc ruined everything in order to get a tip, when I did not gave him a tip he send 3 different people asking for tip SHAME FULL"
"One always hears 'Taj is Taj' - it holds true! It is the Gold Standard of Hospitality and CLASS. Opulence and Grandeur are one thing, something one can spend money and acquire - but something priceless that Taj has, are Heritage, Taste & Class. From the ornate embellishments to the intricate artworks. From the variety of tasteful artefacts to the meticulously clean spotless sparkling amenities. They all make the p(a)lace GRAND. But what really makes it warm, loving, caring and welcoming are the wonderful people. Always with a smile, always taking care of the minutest detail - making the entire process so SMOOTH and seamless. Just a hassle free, pampered, relaxing MEMORABLE vacation!"
The Taj Mahal Palace cannot be faulted at all. Their attention to detail was absolutely impeccable. From the moment we were picked up from the airport everything was taken care of. The checkin was an experience we'll never forget (religious ceremony). All the staff were polite and courteous.  Two members of staff that stood out were Chirag on reception and Amit in the restaurant.  We will certainly be going back. 
"The very best of service, professionalism and courtesy from an Hotel oozing style. Whilst the building itself is stunning it's really the staff that make this Hotel truly amazing. There is not enough space. nor time, for me to explain how wonderful we were treated all I can say is : If you only have one wish to make before you continue your journey to another place put staying at this Hotel at the top of your list."
"Amazing location , excellent food, and best hospitality. Best hotel in Mumbai to stay stop very good good and the staff are very humble and respectful .. the pool was beautiful and me and my friend stayed in the presidential suit which was amazing...  "
They were a very nice understanding hotel. They had a great restaurant. I was not feeling so great and they could tell they got very upset about it and offered me yogurt and tea to make me feel better. They also have great stores and shops in the building. The staff is also very helpful and nice. This has beeen my third stay in this hotel.
"We stayed in the palace club level so the review is based on that experience. The tower level and other level in palace may be drastically different.   The rooms was beautiful (ours was on the 6th floor). It over looked the ocean and the gateway of india. We had an assigned butler although didn't stay in the room long enough to utilize their services.   Concierge service was professional and extremely helpful. They arranged a tour (mumbai at dawn - I highly recommend it) with short notice. Everything was done seamlessly without any additional pressure to use any other service.   The high-tea selection in the club was ok but the maharaja high-tea experience is worth having!   Overall, if you want to splurge, i would recommend staying in this hotel! The staff and service was"
"hotel Taj Mahal Palace, colaba mumbai is excellent place to stay with loved one.The Hotel is just like a palace in good word its a Home away from Home.I visited with my wife on 20th march 2017 and the service from the gate of Hotel is really excellent.The Reception staff, in room dining staff and the room service staff is excellent.All just treated us like special.Food is excellent room is More than excellent.Really Hotel Taj mahal Palace is the Best place to stay."
"For teh first time ever i have been to a hotel so perfect! Right from hospitality to the food items , you are spoilt silly! Been only to the restaurant section but came  out super impressed! Wondering what would the stay be like. Presentation of the food was awesome so was the taste rich... lived upto the name.. wah taj!"
"I could not fault this hotel, the service was impeccable, the staff were so helpful and friendly, I thoroughly enjoyed staying here, loved everything, I was travelling alone and felt safe and very well looked after"
Just amazing!  it is an oasis of calm in a busy city.  We love this hotel and its staff are all so friendly. Food is utterly delicious and sitting by the wonderful pool relaxing is just perfect. I would always recommend a palace wing room because of the old colonial majesty of it.  the building is simply beautiful. Wherever we have been travelling in India we always stay here a few nights on the way home.
"My first stay at the Taj Palace was prior to any renovation and the location was ideal for a first visit. Today it remains an optimum choice for location, however with the upgrade and additional features added to the managing of this unique property, it is now far superior to many hotels around the world. It is like living in an art gallery/museum of heritage, elegance, and finery with modern conveniences and attentive staff. The price is worth every rupee. My suite was a sea view in the original wing...with a window that would open to a priceless view...I would return in a minute and stay longer!"
"Exceptional hotel in all respects. Worth staying on the Club Level with complementary breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails. The staff are uniformly friendly and their attention to detail was faultless. Great location."
"Thee best hotel stay I have ever experienced. Felt like a king and queen on arrival. Faultless. Every member of staff was 10/10. You were greeted by everyone that passed you. The room was exceptional. The housekeeping was something else....Little touches were such a treat from the bracelets gifted by housekeeping, rose petals on the floor, shamy leathers placed on phones and glasses for protection. The pool boy! Wow. Really really fantastic!!!  Can not wait to return "
"We stayed at the Palace wing for few days. The building itself was beautiful, the service was excellent, the location was very convenient. The area around the hotel is vibrant, with many interesting shops just behind the hotel and a very good restaurant, The Table, just round the corner. We'll be back soon."
Only ever seen this place on television and once passing. Now staying here in person is fantastic. If you want a 5 star hotel go elsewhere as this is at least a 7 star. Wonderful staff who are always willing to help. House keeping who do a wonderful job and always go that bit extra and always seem to be there. Thank you great work. The hotel it self is a wonder of the world. One of those places that should be on everyone's bucket list. Once stayed will want to go back.
"We were registered by the pleasant lady called Freya.All the staff were very polite and helpful.The room was well appointed and equipped with all our needs.The view from our balcony overlooking the Gateway of India was inviting.The bed was clean and Very comfortable  The breakfast served in Shamiana was an absolute treat. Mr. Anant Misra and his staff were polite,attentive and accommodating.Eric was always there to serve us with a smile. The spread was excellent each morning with a variety to spoil us.The atmosphere pleasant and inviting.We have enjoyed the best breakfast served in any hotels so far. Had an excellent massage at the Jivanjee Spa. A visit to this Taj is indeed a treat."
"A fabulous, very comfortable hotel without any delusions of grandeur.  All the staff were attentive without being overbearing.  Great location with views of the Arabian Sea and Gate of India - which is so close, it's just a short stroll to go and see.  Sadly we both fell ill (we believe from an inflight meal on a domestic flight on the day we arrived).  However, once the staff knew we were ill they were even more helpful and advised lime and soda which did indeed do the trick.  We were so disappointed that we couldn't properly enjoy the hotel and all it has to offer, so we hope to be back one day to enjoy it when we're fit and well.  There's an elegant monument to those that lost their lives in the Mumbai attacks at the hotel. We were pleased to see it in such a prominent"
We spent three nights in the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel at the beginning of March and I was so glad that I decided to book it as it was an incredible experience and a totally different level to any other hotel we have ever stayed in.  We stayed in the Tower Wing which apparently lacks the period details of the Heritage part but we still loved it as we had booked a sea view room and had a spectacular view of the Gateway to India and all its visitors from our balcony along with the sea and all the little boats. I suppose you could say that the room in the Tower wing was a little dated and perhaps slightly 'tired' looking but the whole hotel stay was impressive from the welcoming ceremony as you arrive to the complementary drinks brought to you in your room. The King size bed was
"Our daughter and her partner stayed in the Taj Palace in February and initially they booked to stay in the Tower block.  However, my husband and I stopped off in Mumbai on a cruise and so went to check out the famous hotel!  It is an absolutely amazing sight and we decided to go inside and check it out both for future reference and because our daughter was going to be there a couple of weeks later.  Inside the hotel one is immediately struck by the palatial splendour of the place and immediately we had a pang of regret that we would not ourselves be staying there. As we were there we thought we would wander over to reception and enquire about the difference between Tower rooms and rooms in the main hotel, as we were aware that our daughter had opted for the Tower. We were"
I would recommend everyone to stay at Taj Palace hotel at least for a night when they are at Mumbai. The food quality is excellent and location is very close to the activities. staff is very nice and helping the rooms were comfortable. the Palace wing has antique decoration worth exploring.
I visited this with friends and it was exquisite.. truly one of its kind with over the top services. The waiters and executives are well informed and know their matter well.  The restaurants are awesome as well 
"I have already tweeted about it, I've sent the hotel an email and I even told the guy I sat next to on the plane about it.... But here is my review...   Honestly I cant even begin to tell you how amazing this hotel is! I can't put it into words because unless you've stayed there you can't understand how increadable it is.   We are truly grateful to have the opportunity to stay at such a fantastic hotel. We treated ourselves for our anniversary. We were treated as if we were the only people staying in the hotel, like royalty. I feel emotional just thinking about it. Everyone went out of their way to make sure we had the best time.   I dont even know where to begin. The room was so clean it was spotless, I even saw the cleaner wearing a hairnet. You could perform surgery in that"
"I stayed in the Tower, which is the newer part of the hotel. The hotel from the street looks quite majestic, but the entrance is small and well guarded.  Taxis let you off on the corner and you pass everything through a metal detector before entering.  The lobby is very nice and there are shops in two directions off the lobby.  They asked me to sit while they sorted out getting my reservation and escorted me up to the room.  The room was appointed ok, and had the qualities of an older, dusty room where I thought my allergies might flare up.  It was overlooking the sea and the Gateway of India, which was nice, although, you could hear the constant honking of horns outside.  Beds were comfortable and bathrooms were fine.  Iron was barely usable.   There are many restaurants in the"
We stayed in the india gate suite it's expensive but you live once. It is exactly what you expected from a five star hotel this is the best I've found. The staff are very well trained to make your visit exceptional. Try too do this once in your lifetime. The high tea is fantastic. The decor outstanding. Hope to visit again treated like royalty.
"The most exquisite hotel I have ever stayed in.  Total luxury, fine art,good food, lovely rooms, flowers everywhere, stunning views and pool but what makes it so brilliant is the impeccable service of its staff.  A rare treat but totally memorable.."
Wonderful stay at a fabulous hotel. Customer service was outstanding and the whole experience was first class. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel at home. The restaurant staff anticipated our needs and the overall service went above and beyond. I have not stayed in any hotel which equals this standard of service.
"We had a great experience at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, due in most part to the special attention of our butler Gaurav.  He made us feel welcome and at home the whole time we were in Mumbai and made sure all of our needs were taken care of with professional ease."
"Even if you don't stay in the hotel, at least go there for drinks or for lunch.  The architecture, ambiance and service all cannot be beat.  It is only of the glories of India - and no one visiting Mumbai should leave the city without at least a brief visit."
"I am not sure I have the vocabulary to describe this hotel. Simply the best hotel I have ever had the privilege to stay at. We were treated very well from check in to check out.The first time I felt like I was treated like my surname(Rajah=King). Our room was in the old section of the hotel which is quite special.  My wife was not well one morning and we asked for housekeeping to clean the room while we left the room for an hour or so. This holiday co-incided with our upcoming 40th anniversary.  When we returned to our room. There was flowers in a pattern in the entrance  area, a bouquet  of the most beautiful red roses in the room. A pillow on the bed -""get well soon"" What a nice touch.  All the staff were excellent but I hesitate to name a few but will mention a few names.  "
Great place to stay. One of the most iconic hotels in the world with great hospitality. You get a great sense of history as you stay in the Taj. The rooms in the palace have great views and the decor of the whole hotel is both modern and retains traditional themes. The artefacts displayed throughout the hotel must be priceless including the pictures by M.F Hussain in the loby
This hotel was the epitome of good service and comfort.   From the minute we arrived to the time of our departure we were made to feel special - nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  It is certainly one of the world's top hotels.
"An icon, nestled like an oasis of decadent charm in the manic city of Mumbai.   Club room on seafront was worth every penny, the view was epic.   The staff and friendly and professional - the Sea Lounge for breakfast is a lot better than the one by reception. Felt like a different calibre of team to be honest.   The pool is gorgeous, catching late afternoon sun and perfect for relaxing after a long day around the city.   Would go back in a heartbeat. "
"I found the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel to be exceptional. The staff, the food, and the ambience were a breath of fresh air amidst the hustle of Mumbai. A true oasis! The best breakfast I have had anywhere! I would not hesitate to return. I recommend the Taj highly."
"Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is the only one of its kind in the country , and the Taj groups most prime property. I always wanted to stay here since i was a kid and it was more like a dream come true for me to stay in here. I booked in the old wing and it was totally worth it. Watching the Arabian sea from the bed when i wake up everyday was a bliss to my eyes, and again the sun set in the evening was also lovely. Enough number of restaurants in the property to dine to your wish. Will definitely go back to the hotel next time am in mumbai."
"What a wonderful stay...the Heritage Tower or Old Tower with sea facing view...just spectacular! Service outstanding and meals excellent. Really a wonderful experience with exceptionally efficient staff and concierge. Very helpful with booking cooking classes, transport and various other services. Pool side loungers were lovely and great experience to have drinks out there."
Wonderful place to visit or stay. Beautiful views of gateway to India. The high tea was delicious and very affordable for a fabulous venue with a view.  You can also have lunch and dinner at the roof top restaurant. Centrally located to tourist areas. Colaba street market is located 2 street behind the Taj palace.  You can walk to all the main tourist attractions of Mumbai or take a ferry to Elephant island to explore the caves or harbour. 
"After a month away it was time for abit of luxury and this certain did not disappoint, simply amazing, from when you walk in the front door to when you, it was like being in a magical place, the staff were beyond fantastic and as was the service"
"After enjoying the peace and serenity of the Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur, entering this hotel was like a blast of cold water.  The lobby was amass with crowds and a noisy hustle bustle. Even though we had reserved a Club Room, which was supposed to have its own dedicated check in area we were forced to stand in the main lobby because there were just no seats to be had. Because  we were in India to celebrate a special occassion, we had requested a room, in the Palace wing with a seaview, but sadly nothing with a seaview was available.  We were shown to a room on the 5th floor which had a pool view but smelled terribly musty, like someone's old basement. I am highly allergic and this situation was unacceptable.  When we asked for another room, we were shown one directly across the"
"I stayed at the Taj in November, and stayed in I think Room 520, I know it was on the 5th floor, in a Taj Executive room, I can't add to all the positive comments on this web site, but I thought the hotel was just wonderful. Having tea or cocktails, or canapés in the Executive Lounge is a real tonic, I had a lovely 4 days away, getting some Winter sun,in utterly unadulterated luxury. The staff simply can not do any more to make your time at the hotel any better.The only thing stopping me from coming again for a short weekend is having to do the Indian passport visa...."
Excellent flagship hotel. Lovely history and great location. The Club level at the palace wing should be a must for all hotel lovers. Wonderful art all over the hotel. You'll just have to stay here to experience it for yourself.
I can't imagine why you would stay anywhere else if you are coming to Mumbai for pleasure.  Our room overlooked the Gateway and watching it during different times of the day and lit up at night was spectacular.  Just a wonderful old but fully renovated hotel with amazing service.  Nothing was too much trouble.  It was a perfect 4 night stay.
One of my favorite hotels in the world.  Excellent service and accommodation.   Only downside is the food quality is not at the same level.  Could have more choice and considering the rest of the hotel could quality could be up a notch.  Loved the garden and the location.
Totally amazing! Great hotel with great customer service everywhere inside from the moment you go through security. I had my birthday while staying here and they made it so amazing with balloons in my room and cake. It was a great surprise. It was an expensive stay but worth it for the experience. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. 
"Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai is always such a beautiful experience that I personally would want to go there again and again if my time permits. The best part about the stay is a drink by pool side at Aquarius and the breakfast at Shamiana."
"good it is a good place in Mumbai,and I found this is a good place to stay. for people relax,but the trafic is not good. hope the trafic will be better in future. I hope I can go to stay here again next time."
"as lovely as ever : wonderful position, extraordinary service, great elegance I loved in particular the quality of the Old Wing, with its antique furniture coupled with high tech facilities the swimming pool was excellent, and a great place to work while enjoying a tea the hotel car took me from and to the airport, which prevented any security issue"
"I stayed in the Taj whilst touring India and if you are in Mumbai I would 100% suggest you book here. The experience of such an amazing hotel with such rich history is definitely worth it. The service is impecible, the rooms were beautiful with an amazing view of the Gate of India. The food was great to! It is the height of luxury, I couldn't fault it in anyway. It is perfect for business, leisure and families. I will definitely be back because the experience is so good that it can't be once in a life time!!"
" I had called the Chinese restaurant at the hotel, for a booking for 4, The booking was done 25 days prior itself, the only request was for a sea view table, I was been denied for the same, I thought there might be some cover charge for the same, for which he said no, I offered to pay 600$ nz from my credit card as an to get reserved, for which I was been denied again, the man was rude to me over the phone, I was never given a reason why they couldn't get me a  table. It was dream to dine at taj palace with my parents as I was coming down from nz after two years, I work as an asst. f&b manager at VR lake resort rotorua, New Zealand, the guy did not make any sense for the denial, I am a from Mumbai, been trained at taj president Mumbai for culinary, always desired to dine at taj"
"I booked a room in the Taj Mahal palace for the 22nd April 2017, only to receive an email saying we did not show up for our booking on March 6th (which we did not book as we do not arrive in the country until the 22nd April) and that we will be charged 1 night accommodation,   I have emailed 3 times since this happened and have received NO response what so ever.   This booking was for the first night of or honeymoon and it could be getting off to a worse start.   Please can someone from the hotel contact me, to assure me that all this is being taken care of.   Having to come to a public forum in order to get a response is not something I honestly expected with The Taj Mahal Palace.  I very much look forward to hearing from someone.  Matthew"
A rich cultural heritage coupled with exceptional Indian hospitality. The Taj Mahal palace exceeds all expectations. Wonderful staff go the extra mile and pay careful attention to detail. A definate must if you appreciate the finer things in life.
As i already give this title the king of hotels in india. Because it is really the no. 1 hotel in india. You can see seaview. I go there for just bussiness meeting but i love this hotel for this fast service. Room service is also very good. Must try this hotel.....
"Excellent stay, better than I had imagined.  Staff professional, rooms comfortable, plenty to do, best hotel I have ever stayed in.  Views of the gate at sunset were pleasant and interesting.  Look forward to returning and taking a tour of the hotel and its history."
"From the moment you are met at the airport but our car and driver to being dropped back at the airport 5 days later it was an amazing hotel and an amazing experience, good security and I felt safe in the property, we were lucky enough to be upgraded from the Tower to the Heritage side of the hotel, Beautiful steeped in History, and great that the hotel is so proud of its heritage and runs heritage walk of the build, gorgeous flower arrangements throughout and well maintained hotel, super staff very attentive and nothing to much trouble, eat in a number of restaurants (Golden Dragon, Aquarius, Harbour Bar, Sea Lounge) could not fault the food - Golden Dragon very impressed, there was a dish we liked that was not on the menu, the Chef came to the table we explained our request and"
"Excellent hotel, well appointed furnishings.  Good location, although a bit far from the airport. it is facing the Arabian Sea and India Tower. The architecture is beautiful and the restaurants were excellent.  Breakfast buffet was more than ample as well."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is certainly only of the best hotels we stayed in: fantastic location; beautiful building; excellent service and amenities! Constructed by one of India's most powerful families in very early nineties, this hotel has kept all is British influenced culture and life pleasures. Truly wonderful!"
"We stayed here for our last night of a three month holiday in Asia including Thailand , Laos ,Vietnam , Cambodia and India. I have to say it was the best hotel of our trip. I told the receptionist when we were checking in that I had been to this hotel in 1976 when I was 22 but only on the outside and always wanted to stay here . She said , ""OK, I'll do something nice for you "" . She upgraded us to a heritage suite in the Original building , Fantastic ."
"Staying at the Taj Palace Mumbai was the perfect contra to the madness of the streets of Mumbai. The serene royalty of our hotel room and overall hotel accomodations, and the fastidiousness and heartfelt warmth and helpfulness of the entire hotel staff , were a welcome respite from the honking, the crowds and the destitute poverty in outlying city.  Having a place to relax and recoup helped us in thoroughly enjoying a fascinating cultural experience."
Best place to stay in Mumbai. A heritage property. friendly staff and beautiful view. Best location. good variety of restaurants and excellent hospitality. Must try any of Jiva spa . All the best shopping areas and hospitals are nearby.
"I have stayed in Hotels around the world and experienced excellent service and amenities, however this Hotel was without doubt the very best in everything from arriving, to leaving.  The amenities and attention to detail by every member of the staff was of the highest standard and their aim was to serve and please every guest no matter how great or small the task. I am unable to score any of the selected categories less than 10.     This Hotel was the best of the best and without doubt my wife and I will be returning in the future."
"excellent hotel in perfect location and very attentive staff . Awesome facilities and great spa. Highly recommend this hotel . As good as it can get in every respect . Would go again in a heartbeat. The food was excellent, especially the breakfast. Great hotel and great service. Very luxurious rooms and very well located"
"This could be the most divine hotel on the planet.  I cannot properly describe how wonderful this hotel is in a post.  Fantastic location, superb service.  Amongst other things, the evening turn-down service leaves a book mark in your bedside reading material.  Love! Book a palace room."
Opulent oasis of pristine serenity amidst the chaotic hustle and bustle of Mumbai life. Wonderful view of the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea from the sea view suit; Shamiana the Indian restaurant is 5 star quality. Wine is super expensive! I would return to this hotel any time.  Overall a sublime princely experience! Really efficient and helpful staff....
This is a fantastic hotel the room was amazing. The people friendly and the service was spot on. Definitely stop at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone. Brilliant  In a brilliant spot for shopping and restaurants. The restaurants in the hotel are lovely and there is a lovely bar to sit and relax with a drink at night. The pool is nice to relax by they come round with cold bottles of water which is nice and the service is brilliant. Also near the pool there are tables and chairs where you can get a drink and somethings to eat.
"Top hotel.  Great service (except a little chaotic at check in), wonderful view of the harbor; Inidan restaurant is 5 star as is Lebanese restaurant on top floor.  Wine is super expensive.  I would return to this hotel any time.  The staff could not be better and there is a great Starbucks around the corner"
"You can all look at the website so I won't describe the hotel or tell you about gluten policy. We arrived at the end of our trip for 2 nights and we were greeted by a very nice lady who told us that we had been upgraded to a club room which meant cocktails, high tea and so on. Smell a rat? Yes we did.  I asked whether it was a twin room - yes.  Are there two (2) beds?  Well we have put two single duvets.  But are there two beds? No. Why? Well we can't always guarantee what people ask for. At $1500 you can. To cut a long story short they put in a comfortable roll-away for the night making the room very crowded.  We availed ourselves of the cocktails and had a very nice meal in the Chinese restaurant. The next day I called our travel agent Nikhil Chibber at Western and Oriental in"
A sublime experience! Really efficient and helpful staff...the concierge Sandeep was an exceptionally helpful gentleman and all together wonderful stay! The Heritage wing offers beautiful sea views together with a view of The Gateway to India. The welcome ceremony is a lovely personal touch.
"We visited during Chinese New Year period in 2017. It wasn't as crowded as I had feared, was spotlessly clean and clearly venerated.  As a testament to love, grief and a tribute to craftsmanship and local artistry it takes some beating.  I was staggered at the workmanship of the inlaid semi precious jewels, the symmetry and architectural precision and the vision demonstrated so long ago. The setting is also beautiful although they could clean up the river behind the palace a bit."
"All was perfect : the room with its view, the food, the services(driver), the free wi-fi, the kindness of all the staff, the marvellous location close to the Gateway to India and to the ships for Elephanta  !"
"The Taj Mahal is a very grand hotel and is worthy of its 5 stars. The hotel is dripping with history and charm, and the staff work hard to ensure your stay is comfortable.  The hotel is located in the historic centre of Mumbai, and is ideal as a base for tourist sight seeing, and with a good choice of restaurants in the neighbourhood.  Our room was in the Taj Mahal Tower (i.e. the 1970s extension rather than the original architectural masterpiece). The room was modern, clean and functional. There were no particular wow features about the room other than the view from the window (which looked out over the Gateway of India and the harbour).  The customer service was of a very high standard, with lots of pleasant surprises as part of the turn down service. Similarly at breakfast"
"Stayed here as a single female and was upgraded to the heritage wing, to the Taj Club which gives you some excellent privileges like high tea, happy hour and after dinner cognac and chocolates. Who knew that even existed! But it was exciting! The heritage wing is absolutely beautiful, rebuilt after the terrorist attack, and they talk of this often. Hard to believe it really happened. On the first day I joined the later afternoon walk around the hotel to learn more about the history of the place and that was very interesting. The pool area is so well managed, always able to get a lounger and the courteous staff provided towels and water promptly. Concierge gave me a fab map and highlighted some areas for walks in the city and all sorts of other useful tips on where to go and how"
Great hotel; great location facing the Gateway of India; beautiful rooms; excellent buffet breakfast; very good restaurants. Service was exceptional. Beautiful grounds with lovely pool. This is clearly a five star hotel. 
Enjoy my last day at the Taj.  Everything was superb. The staff was extremely attentive and warm. Always eager to please. Store were nice bought some Joy sandals. Breakfast was great. Tea time was lovely. Indian restaurant was excellent. All in all a great stay!
"We came to enjoy the amenities of the Taj.  Enjoy we did!  The hotel was very helpful in airport transfers as well as helping with touring the area.  Our daughter fell ill while at the hotel, the staff was very worried and helpful in her recovery.  Thanks for everything."
The hotel is in a good location and everything is perfect. Good selection of restaurants. Staff are so helpful. Our room had an excellent view of the Gateway of of India and wonderful sunrises.  Would stay here again.
The swimming pool can only be used by guests that booked room.... We had dinner there and couldn't see almost nothing of the Hotel. The food at the restaurant Massala Kraft was expensive but very good. 
I stayed in the hotel for 3 days 5 to 8 march. The look of the hotel is excellent. you will feel amazing.The services are beyond imagination.The quality of food is excellent. Their hospitality everything is excellent. Extremely good location.
"The stay was fantastic- from the hospitality, through the amenities, to the food, and the overall service. The experience was great and I highly recommend this hotel to any and all! Also, in a fantastic and historic area of hustling and bustling Mumbai."
"Arriving as a group of 14 ex servicemen, from the second we entered the hotel right through to leaving 6 days later we had an amazing experience and were treated like royalty by all the staff.  This hotel is somewhat special and should be treasured.  Now I've experienced it I wouldn't consider anywhere else in Mumbai to stay again."
"Once you have to visit Mumbai, the most memorable place to stay is the Taj Mahal Palace & Towers. It leaves you with unforgettable memories by all means. The rooms, the restaurants, the service, all are excellent. Once you have stayed here, for sure during your next (business) trip you wish to stay in the Taj Mahal Palace & Towers again."
"We were fortunate to spend two nights here in January.  We booked a Palace Wing room overlooking the Gateway of India.  The room was luxurious and clean, and it was fascinating to watch the boats and crowds from this vantage point.  We joined the hotel tour, which happens late each afternoon.  This was a very informative half an hour, which brought the history of the hotel to life.  The pool and garden area is beautiful, although we were not lucky enough to find a free sunbed from which to enjoy it in full!! The hotel has a wonderful ambiance, with stunning flower arrangements throughout the common areas.  We found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful, although the service at breakfast was a little hit and miss.  We ate in the Japanese Restaurant on our first night at a"
"Ah, it's hard to categorize this place. Is it a luxury hotel, Yes. Is it a heritage hotel? A resounding yes! All that plus the tragedy of a brutal terrorist attack that saw the hotel held seige for several days. So it is safe to assume someone staying there for the first time will have mixed feelings. Yet all that changes when you walk in through the non-descript revolving door in a huge, massive lobby with ultra high ceilings, plush carpets and a gigantic flower display in an enormous vase at the center of the lobby. A stay at this place is at the very least awe inspiring.   As you walk through the corridor, past designer boutiques and Michelin star restaurant Wasabi by Mori Moto, up the elevator, to the Palace wing, you'll realize this is not just a hotel, it is a sanctuary of"
"No shade on Mumbai, but we felt transported to another world once we entered the Taj.  Every need is not only met, but anticipated, and all expectations are exceeded.  The only downside of staying here is that you won't want to leave."
Our party of 14 ex servicemen were treated like royalty from the second we walked in the door.  We were given rooms in both the Palace area and the new tower.  all rooms were magnificent.  Breakfast has a vast choice and the restaurant staff extremely helpful and friendly.  There is not one minute in the 6 day stay that any of us had any inkling of a reason to complain.  The service in this hotel is second to none.
"It has been a long held wish to stay in this hotel and finally, i got to spend a night here. It really did not disappoint, from the amazing welcome we got from arriving, to an amazing room in palace wing, to great food, drink and staff. I couldn't fault this place, from the little touches such as aarti every night. I really struggled to leave and only wished I stayed longer.....but I will be back! "
Sadly only stayed for two nights. A beautiful hotel with everything running very smoothly. Good position next to the India Gate and the water. Staff exceptional throughout. We were made very welcome by all that we encountered. Nice room and food very acceptable.
"A stay in the Palace Wing is quite an experience particularly in a club room with complimentary afternoon tea, cocktails and chocolate and cognac.  We even had Butler Service.  It's obviously quite expensive but worth it once in a while."
"Just Excellent ! Right from the moment we entered, till the moment we departed, the experience was truly spiritual, very uplifting and surpasses expectations. The smile, the courtesy, the professionalism, the taste, the aesthetics, the heritage... all add to making the experience unforgettable"
"We had a lovely stay at this palace hotel. We thought that our experience wouldn't be that interesting because it was already our second time but we were wrong. In fact, we have done a lot more than our first time! Breakfasts, cocktails and dinners at the Sea Lounge, lunches in Shamiana, afternoon snacks by the pool at the Aquarium and afternoon teas and cocktails at the Club lounge, shopping in between inside the hotel, we literally lived in the palace!  The only confusion we had was when we thought that the wine displayed along with the goblets when we checked in to our room was complimentary but apparently, there was a price at the very bottom of the tag. At the end, we were charged with one and had the other one complimentary. Also, just be careful when your butler asked you"
"I have been lucky enough to stay in three taj palace hotels in Udaipur, Jaipur and Hyderabad and was expecting this to be the same standard.  Unfortunately this was far from the case.  The hotel is extremely busy with visitors wanting to check out the place, people attending conferences as well as bone fide guests.  This means the two lobby areas are a bit of a scrum at times.  There are two lobbies, one for tower wing and one for the palace wing.  If staying in the palace wing like we were you invariably end up trailing around through both to meet guides or visit restaurants.  The hotel felt more like a standard city hotel rather than a luxury retreat.  We had the palace room with a harbour view of the gate of India.  The room was tastefully decorated in mute green colours but"
"Had afternoon tea here, more of a high tea in reality given that there were hot dishes; curry, potatoes, sausage rolls & toasties along with cakes and sandwiches. Overall this was quite nice though quite a small venue & rather informal - the gentlemen here let the side down in trainers & shorts in some instances!  The food was very nice though largely unlabelled. only knew what items were as I was with friends. We weren't given any sort of drinks menu, the waiters just came over to offer tea/ coffee / masala tea. Not quite like afternoon teas in England where an extensive tea menu is offered up!  Wonderful piano playing, delightful setting. Very near the gateway of India (just 5 minutes across the street)."
"This is the best hotel in the world. I can really not put into words just how wonderful this place is. We stayed in the palace side and we were really glad we did. It makes the whole experience a million times better. The building is so exquisite, that I spent the first 3 or 4 hours just taking pictures of the beautiful architecture. When you are walking round you feel like you are in a period drama, it’s such a stunningly beautiful place, steeped in history, I really was in oar of the place.  After a few hours of walking round and taking in the magic of the hotel, we went on a history tour, run by the hotel and it was so interesting and worthwhile.  I have always wanted to stay in this hotel and felt that if you are going to visit Mumbai, then this is all part of it. You can"
"We had arranged to be picked up from the airport and the car was waiting with cold water, towels and sweets for the journey. On arrival at the hotel, at very late at night or early in the morning, we were met and greeted by name, offered a cool drink and shown to our room. From start to finish the service, the staff and attention to detail was unsurpassable.  When we arrived we ordered ice from room service for a g&t. When the ice arrived the waiter offered to fetch us sliced lemons and returned with trays of nuts, all complimentary. We dined in two of the restaurants and the quality of food and standard of service was amazing. Nothing was overlooked. Our room was superb, spotlessly clean, a very comfortable bed with an amazing view of the Gateway to India. This is hotel is an"
"This is a very large, impersonal hotel which is awash with members of the public coming in for a look and conference clients at events.  The upper levels are for residents only, but they only contain guest bedrooms. So, from a security perspective, that's great, but some exclusive restaurants / bars are really what's required.  A series of little, but cumulative things such as housekeeping consistently trying to 'turn-down' our bed at 5pm, when you've just got in from sightseeing / work - please wait until people have had a chance to shower / go out for their evening meal at 7pm+. Even with the turn-down there's no chocolate, slippers presented, nighttime thought etc as you would receive in other Taj's. It's really just a cleaning refresh here.  Another small point is that only"
"If you are looking for an extraordinary location that has great history, elegant decor, excellent service, and beautiful flower arrangements, stay at the Taj Palace in Mumbai.  There are no words that do justice - just come and see for yourself."
"I have had the good fortune over the years to stay at some outstanding hotels but this one is at the very top of ""my list."" The building is truly lovely and impressive, starting with the flower arrangements in the lobby! But the service -- oh my -- the service is beyond belief. For example, upon arrival, we accidentally blew the electrical fuse in our room (at 10:30 pm) -- they had it fixed in no time and then sent us a nice gift with a letter of apology the next day for the inconvenience which WE caused!!!  The restaurant service was equally impressive as that of the front desk, the concierge, etc. When my wife needed an unusual set of batteries and a device for her computer, they ordered the items and they were in our hands within an hour or two! I could go on and on; members"
"This is a beautiful, immaculate and stunning building inside and out. The food is great and the swimming pool is lovely. Without a doubt, this is the ONLY place to stay in Mumbai. I stayed in the Palace side which was quite simply breathtaking."
"Everything about this hotel is wonderful but especially the staff who are exceptionally attentive, helpful and friendly.  The ambiance is perfect and it's a really pleasure and privilege to stay here. Love the view over breakfast in the sea lounge and freshly made masala dosa."
"Make sure to stay at Taj Mahal when in Mumbai. The location is perfect, right by the ocean and port of India, plus the service at the Hotel is incredible. Whatever you need they will make sure you have it. It is also nice to spend time at the Hotel area getting away from the busy Bombay Life outside. "
"What can one say about this hotel that hasn't already been said? Everyone should try to visit this hotel at least once in their lives.  When you walk inside this hotel from the craziness that is Mumbai, you enter a different world of calm and elegance. The staff are immaculate. The interior of the hotel is beautiful. We were made to feel honoured guests even though we were just ordinary tourists.  We had club rooms in the Palace Wing, which were worth it for the extras such as afternoon tea and evening drinks which you have in a luxurious room with leather sofas. The breakfast room for the Palace Wing overlooks the sea and the Gateway of India.   To get the full experience of the hotel you should only stay in one of the Palace Wing rooms.  The outdoor swimming pool is like an"
"The Taj is an incredibly beautiful and well appointed hotel.  They have developed outstanding service standards throughout the hotel. The breakfasts were outstanding and would appeal to any taste European, Asian or North American.The hotel is decorated and finished superbly and constitutes an artist's pallet of interesting corners, scents, and flowers everywhere.A luxury and standard of service to be enjoyed."
"The hotel was amazing the minute we stepped in.  The lobby was welcoming as it was vast.  The best touch was the front desk personnel greeting us at the entrance of the lobby and performing an arti and giving us a mala.   The views and breakfast was superb.  The spa, although pricey for the service and amenities, was comforting.  The only disappointment was the salon.  I was really disappointed with the service and work my daughter, my son and I received there especially for the outrageous prices.  I spoke to the front desk person about it as we received the services the day we were leaving and did not have time to go back to the salon.  The front desk staff said that she would let the salon know and adjust our price.  Nothing was ever done about that.   However, the hotel is"
"The Taj gave us everything we wanted and more. The staff were outstanding, anticipating our every need and the hotel itself is beautiful and historic in an outstanding location.  Truly a memorable stay."
"Selection and quality of food at Breakfast was little disappointing, in particular the fruit and yogurt selection and egg counter.   There was no authentic Indian masala tea available, just ‘dipped’ tea.  Having to repeatedly ask for water and coffee was irritating.  Service at both the buffet breakfast in the Sea Lounge and in the club lounge was hit and miss and not to the same high standards I have experienced in other 5 star hotels throughout the world.  Having to repeatedly ask for drinks and waiting for up to 15 minutes in the club lounge is not what I would have expected, the same was the case during breakfast with long waits.  The staff although friendly and helpful lacked the finesse and professionalism I was expecting, they did not demonstrate a high standard of"
"Having stayed here on previous occasions, I was looking forward to going back with my husband to what I consider to be one of the most unique and wonderful hotels I have ever stayed in.  New management have made changes which are are always necessary for any business to stay competitive and thrive.  Something however was amiss on this stay. Don't get me wrong; it's still an amazing and beautiful place to stay.  Little things however detracted from the ""Taj Touch"" which I have known and loved for so long.  An absence of  all the old faces, young members of staff constantly distracted by mobile phones, spelling mistakes on the menu , hair in the breakfast buffet! You set the standard by which other hotels were judged ; please don't take the slippery slope down.  I consider coming"
"The Taj Mahal Palace overlooks the Gateway of India. It's an oasis away from the hustle and bustle outside. Unlike many large 5 star hotels, it's also alive. I love ""people watching"" in the plush foyer, lazing around the pool with a good book or enjoying a simple cocktail. I've stayed here a few times & after sampling some alternative hotels closer to the airport will always return to The Taj Palace in Colaba. The atmosphere is unbeatable."
"I've been lucky to stay in some of the best hotels in the world, and the Taj is up there with the absolute best. We just spent two nights here at the end of our two week India honeymoon.  We were upgraded to an executive suite, which was huge and very comfortable.  The decor was a little lacklustre, but it was nice to have all the space.  Service was incredible - from the smiles and greetings from the security staff when you arrived to the friendly housekeeping staff and our own butler, who helped with some small but useful things (like bubblewrapping some bazaar purchases for our plane trip), it was seamless and never over-attentive.  We spent most of our time at the pool, which was beautiful and luxurious.  Breakfast was delicious.  I would definitely recommending going for"
"we stayed for one night with group of friends  we booked a connected room 602-603. (Tower Wing) Sea View over the “Indian Gate”  Only one has a balcony even though they have the same price rate. Nevertheless it was fine.  -The service is a top-notch. -The View was very nice. -Colaba street is just behind the Palace.  Btw Taxi in Mumbai is very cheap however, you can also get a personal clean luxury Car “Mercedes” with a driver operated by Taj Mahal for a rate around 20$ per hour which I find worth a try."
"I rarely give a 5 star rating, but this hotel earns it by the most helpful service I have ever experienced. The comfortable rooms are good sized, with great views on the sea side, and good beds and Climate control. The restaurants are very good to excellent. Location is Convenient for Mumbai sightseeing and shopping, with many attractions (and ATMS) within a few walkable blocks.  Wonderful, deep swim pool and excellent gym with knowledgeable trainer. Spa. Large business center.  Would absolutely stay here again !"
"Great historic place, wow factor present. I had dinner in one of the rooftop rooms, great view, great service, great food. How nice to see that the hostoric feeling has been restored after the destruction by the attacks i 2008. Very nice place, enjoyed it greatly."
"The Taj Mahal Palace hotel is one of the best hotels we have experienced (and we've done a bit of world traveling).  The ambience, the general accommodations are what you would expect from a 5 star, world class hotel, but what makes this hotel outstanding is the service you receive.  The staff is pleasant and extraordinary in their willingness to accommodate your needs.  My husband needed emergency dental work, and a friend traveling with us needed medication.  The hotel staff met, and exceeded the expectations of attending to their needs efficiently and expediently.  The restaurants we visited were also above par. The location is perfect for seeing the sites of Mumbai.  If you can indulge yourself, the Taj Mahal Palace hotel is a must when visiting Mumbai."
"This hotel brings a sense of history and an unrivaled position to the best modern standards. The room although not the most expensive was ideal for the two of us, with all modern facilities. We had a lovely view over the Gateway, and viewing the crowd there was enjoyable. The hotel has several restaurants, and shops selling Indian goods. We would recommend anyone to visit the Gateway itself and mingle with the crowd of Indian people. We would have no worries in recommending this hotel."
"We have stayed at this hotel several times and have never been disappointed. The location is wonderful - right next to the Gateway of India and very close to busy shops and many of the major galleries and museums.  There are all the  facilities you would expect from a hotel of this standard. The food is excellent and there is plenty of choice. We particularly loved having afternoon tea in the Sea Lounge.  The staff are very friendly, helpful and efficient. Can't wait to go back!!"
This is a well located classic hotel on the waterfront in Mumbai. The foyer is like a metro station at times it is so busy.  It is expensive and does need an update although it's setting will help secure its high rated position for the future in this fast moving city. Bedrooms are a bit dated.   Multiple ground floor receptions are confusing (old hotel and newer taller extension - make sure you know which you are booking).   Staff are helpful and very polite.
"We stayed for two nights at this beautiful hotel, as soon as we arrived, having been collected from the airport by a hotel chauffeur ( our little treat to ourselves) we were greeted by four staff all willing to assist us. If l had been carrying my mobile phone I'm sure one would have offered to carry it.  There was no standing at reception to book in, we were taken straight to our room and the paperwork done there. The bedroom en-suite was nicely decorated and we were treated to a view of the Gateway to India from our balcony.  There is a nice swimming pool with a drinks/ eating area all well maintained. The bar lounge served interesting cocktails and we took full advantage. With several restaurants serving different cuisines there was no lack of choice. However we did find"
I will always remember your willingness of the staff to help my family and me during our stay at the Taj Mahal Hotel Mumbai. It takes a very special individuals to make Taj the number one hotel in India. Your example is a wonderful lesson for all those in hospitality business to learn from. Please accept my sincere thanks to everyone working at the Taj Mahal hotel specially one fine young man at the housekeeping Mr. Sandeep. Tremendously brilliant guy who knows his job and what customer service is all about. My family was very pleased and very impressed with him.
"We stayed for 5 days in a Club room in the heritage wing of this iconic hotel and loved every minute.  The view from our room was of the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea .... perfect!  We had breakfast in the Sea Lounge overlooking the same view.  We took advantage of our Club room complimentary tea/coffee throughout the day and high tea, but never managed to find time to sample the cocktails and cognac.  Housekeeping was impeccable, we loved the thoughtful touches such as book marks, spectacle cleaners etc left in our room.  We found the service throughout the hotel was outstanding  (Palace Lounge, Sea Lounge, bar, poolside, reception and concierge) .  All staff were pleasant and friendly.  Thank you to everyone and special thanks to Vaibhav Chaskar in the Palace Lounge for"
The service and the food were top notch and I would recommend staying here. I found the included breakfast awesome with a wide variety of food offered. The staff were so friendly and very helpful. The location is very convenient for shopping.
"We really enjoyed this palace full of charm. Very clean and confortable, it is also very well located near Gate of India. Very kind people, they are attentive to their customer but it is not heavy. Vey good advises at the information desk. We love this place."
"This is the very nice hotel u can smell sweet fragrance overe there inside of hotel ,rooms pool & etc are very nice but food service is not good some workers are forgetful persons they can provide u wrong food it was happened with my friend . in the last I would like to say to all this hotel is very nice u can see the sea , gateway of India & pretty boats from your rooms.....thank u"
There are Taj hotels and there is the Taj Mahal palace ..a class apart ... from the first email I sent regarding a doubt I had which was promptly answered to the time we actually entered the hotel the service was a class apart ... every single person in that hotel strives to make the experience a memorable one . Was celebrating a birthday so the room was decorated with balloon s and also got a tasty cake ... special shout out to Natasha Jassawala for taking care of it .   Got upgraded to sea view room thank u Taj with a beautiful view of gate way of india was a wonderful way to wake up . Bathrooms are a bit outdated but hey with such nice people who strive to make your stay amazing who's complaining .  Thank you Taj Mahal for a memorable experience definitely recommend it to any
The Taj palace is one of India's landmarks worth visiting any time.Service at this beauty in Mumbai is a must for even a cup of coffee. We stayed at this location and had dinner at the bbq restaurant which is only for residents. What a treat..the lamb was cooked to perfection and the lobster to die for..its besides the pool and only serves dinner. The chef Mr Yadav prepared a great meal for us. The Taj Group of hotels is par excellence we have stayed at their other hotels and service is so consisent.
"As always I loved my stay in this hotel. It is truly India at her best. Hope to visit again soon.  The rooms are excellent, the staff is wonderful and they make you feel so welcome. The food is good, the service is fantastic and the hotel is an amazing place to stay."
"Oh what can I say Fab Fab Fab wish we could have stayed for more than one night !  You must stay here it's fantastic History and a top quality hotel without the snobbery . After 17 days of traveling around India you can imagine how worn out we were and feeling like a couple of back packers who needed a really good wash after the sights, smells and bad sanitary conditions we were ready for our special night before flying back to the uk. We emailed the hotel before arriving that we wanted to do the heritage tour of the Hotel , they were really helpful and said they would book us on it , we arrived at 5pm luckily just in time for the 5-30 tour . The check in really nice easy and really look after you even into your room which was fantastic we had booked a palace wing room with"
"Absolutely exquisite stay and amazing customer service. We arrived after midnight and were leaving that evening, so the Taj upgraded us three levels to one of their highest suites and arranged all our transportation to the airport. I've stayed at 5* hotels before, but this was above and beyond anything I had ever experienced!!"
"My wife and I stayed here at the end of our 4 week holiday in India.  We had opted for the Taj as the ""icing on the cake"".  But we were underwhelmed.  We have stayed in at least 3 other hotels on this trip that have been just as good if not better.  It is a shame but we feel the place is living on past glories and needs a good shake up to bring some zest back into the place."
This place is always very close to my heart and it had been my dream to take my Girlfriend for a date there to celebrate life. This time although late but reached Shamiana and was greeted with a warm welcome as usual. The menu has changed and was unable to find my favorite Pudina Prawns. However upon request the chef prepared the same for us and its the same taste that i remember years after. Thanks Taj for making it so great place for me and my love.
"Loved the history and reason for the building of this elegant gem in Mumbai.  Exclusiveness, by the British, led to the TATA's building this hotel- for everyone.  Calm, understated elegance, beautiful pool, amazing service, walking where many others have gone before, all add to its allure and prime position looking onto the Gateway of India.  Absolute must o experience- at least once in a lifetime.  Blow the budget for a night or two and really enjoy.  Staff are wonderful, discreet, polite, professional and will do everything possible to make your stay memorable."
"Stayed 2 nights as a couple. Stunningly beautiful, Excellent value  Great location - near attractions and an excellent selection of shops, bars, and restaurants. Service - they go above and beyond to pamper you. We had a problem with a delivery we were expecting to arrive for us at the hotel, and they did everything they could to help.  Restaurants - multiple options. We had drinks at the pool, and they were insanely expensive. We had drinks and food at the Sea Lounge during happy hour, and it was reasonably priced and very good. There are many excellent options outside the hotel, so that was the extent of our experience dining and drinking at the hotel. Room - very nice, comfortable, and clean. The view from our room was no good, but that's not a big deal.  The wifi was good. I"
This is a very exceptional property with a lot of history and character ably backed with superb service. I love staying here . I am struggling to find anything to complain  about even for constructive purposes!!Though the past visits have been for work. I consider the property ideal for a vacation too. The hotel and the service does Mumbai proud.
"We have just returned from our THIRD stay at the Taj Palace in Mumbai and loved it once again!  Fabulous service, beautiful rooms, excellent food. Staff are warm and accommodating.  It's the only place we'd stay in Mumbai. Can't recommend it enough."
"Beautiful hotel and can be quite over whelming. Has everything about being a luxury hotel but you could get lost among the many guests coming in and out. If you are looking for a more intimate one on one personalized experience this may not be the hotel but in Mumbai, I doubt. Grand in everyway, from service to dinning and shopping experience. Value for money. "
"You must stay at the Taj Mahal Palace.  If you have booked the Tower, see if you can get upgraded to the Palace.  Well worth it.  Excellent location and great walking area nearby.  Close to boats for tours to Elephant Island"
"The hotel is really amazing , the structure of the hotel the interior is very beautiful, jus loved this placed, I was here wth my friends we enjoyed a lot one of the best day it was,the food is very delicious .i would recommend one should atleast visit once at this place "
"This is a palatial, luxurious hotel with a large, beautiful pool and garden. We stayed overnight and enjoyed a yoga class,  breakfast, and a swim. The rooms are lovely and beautifully appointed.  The service was excellent and breakfast was very good."
"We had rooms booked in the Tower but when my brother mentioned we were celebrating my 50th birthday we were upgraded to the Palace.  The room was gorgeous, every comfort catered for.  We got to the room and were greeted by our butler and a birthday cake.  The next day I had a dozen red roses and balloons all over the room. This hotel and its staff truly understand how to delight their customers.  I could wax lyrical but needless to say, for us, this is the best hotel in the world!"
"Beautiful place, excellent service, great choice of bars/restaurants to enjoy and awesome location. Loved it. We popped over the the oberoi too, I think Taj was better.  Turn down service was especially good, really made an effort."
The iconic tajmahal hotel is second name of excellent service. The most beautiful hotel located opposite to Gateway of India overlooking the Arabian see is grandeur defined. It is century old and he legacy of tatas is preserved in old royalty styled decor and politeness by the staff. The food is amazing served in multiple speciality restaurants. Ambience is lovely and calls for return again and again. The terrorist attack on this iconic hotel left everybody shattered. But the spirit of tatas has brought back to its original glory multifold.
"My Mumbai friends said to stay her.  The service is possibly the best I have received. The building is not new, rooms not as big as some hotels but is being upgraded. But still excellent. Had a great view over the Gateway.  Food is good not cheap though.  The staff really do a lot.   Hotel is expensive though by Indian standards, I got a better price through hotels.com"
"I had read the reviews, and seen the TV shows about this hotel, but nothing could have prepared me for the actual experience.   Having been lucky enough to stay at 5 star hotels across the world, the Taj service really trumps them all. While there is nothing the Taj can about its location(By that I mean its not placed on a white sandy beach, or atop the alps) once you are safely tucked away inside the doors of the Taj, away from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai, you could easily be in either of those other two destinations, the hotel is a world away from the assault on your senses that is Mumbai. A city we absolutely love!"
"We loved our stay, a totally indulgent treat and a great way to land gently in India after a long haul flight. The pool was amazing - we fell asleep on the sun loungers to the sound of the fountains playing. The service from beginning to end was exceptional - always calm in the face of some imagined drama. Breakfast in the Sea Breeze lounge was spectacular. As owners of a guest house, we learnt an awful lot about the business by observing things done  the first class way consistently. one of my favourite things was that the staff really seem to feel to be part of the hotel, the brand, the experience, everyone taking pride in doing their part to create excellence. We felt very relaxed and very lucky to have had this stay."
"The Taj Palace Hotel is Truly Heritage in every sense offering a WoW experience to it's residents. Staffs are very well mannered Heritage Walk should not be missed by those who are keen in knowing the ""Past to Present"" of this Great Place/Hotel."
"A nice and beautiful hotel in an amazing location, with excellent restaurants and shops. The rooms in the old part of the hotel are charming and cosy and the service very good. Big  swimming pool and nice gym . I loved my stay."
"Mumbai was our last stop of our holidays in India and the best one of all. From the welcoming to the services, cleanliness, details, care, food to the farewell. This place is a well-deserved landmark of the city. I didn't want to leave!"
Staying in the old Palace rooms is a taste of what life was like under the old Raj. Wonderful location overlooking the sea and the Gateway to India. Excellent food and service. Not quite as grand as it was before the post terrorist refurbishments but still a wonderful experience.
"My stay at the Taj was nothing short of extraordinary. From delectable food, to beautiful views, rich heritage and staff who were ALWAYS smiling and more than willing to assist, I will highly recommend the Taj to anyone. It's accommodation fit for a queen!"
"Very nice hotel, well located, but highly priced including dozens of taxes !!!   Well equiped bathroom, but outlet for electric shaver not working properly... It took over 24 hours to get it fixed !!!  Beware of non-spicy dishes ! They may be spicy ! It wasmy experience !"
"The view of the Gate of India is great. I could see the Gate right from my room. However, the smell in the room makes this stay not satisfactory, especially the second day of my stay. Most restaurants in the hotel are closed after 2:45 p.m., which is not convenient for the guests who arrive in the afternoon."
Visited hotel for drinks on Valentine's Day it  is a place on my bucket list and did not disappoint service was fantastic this is a high end 5 star hotel as good as it gets the hotel is beautifully presented and every detail taken care of wish we had more time there 
"Wow! The Taj Mahal Palace has everything you could ever ask for in a hotel. It is a haven in an otherwise chaotic and often overwhelming city. Our family of seven (ages 20-80) stayed in January 2017 and the experience was great for all. The service and amenities are top notch, the food is well prepared and includes cuisines from all over the world (great for those that are unwilling or unable to eat only Indian cuisine), and the people are kind and welcoming.   From the minute you walk into the hotel you will be comfortable. The staff goes out of their way to make sure that your stay is perfect. The service is diligent, but not overwhelming and the architecture and decor of the hotel are beautiful. The pool and poolside service are also great, especially in the Indian heat. At"
"Good location, next to Indian gate, room is clean with a window that open on the city buildings. Breakfast is adequate. The room rate is very expensive even more expensive than in New York or Toronto downtown hotels with similar services."
"Name is enough, and it goes beyond. It is so charismatic that you will always to stay here. There is plenty to see and do, it is actually a museum. Their service is excellent, it will make you believe that you are the most important guest of the hotel."
"Staying in the palace wing was on my bucket list.  It did not disappoint.  You really HAVE to pay extra for a sea facing room on an upper floor.  Get club access and the amazing exclusive high tea and breakfast rooms.  Do get up early for the sunrise over the gateway of India.  An incredible once in a lifetime experience.  Obviously everything is expensive there so don't kid yourself on that one.  Food selection at the poolside restaurant was a little disappointing though.  If it is just the views you want then the sea views in the tower wing is actually better, esp from a very high floor.  Thats for next time."
"This is our first trip to India. The Taj Mahal Palace is an excellent hotel, a perfect location, very clean, comfortable, there's good service, professional and well-trained staff, many good restaurants, and a fabulous club lounge. We really love the hotel.. "
The whole India Experience was second to none. The tour content was Excellent and hotels were Exquisite. The knowledge of our Tour Manager Emma and our Guide Sanjay was everything we could possible wish for. WE WILL BE BACK
The most romantic hotel especially the palace wing.The hotel is located just near the gate of india and the view is beautiful . excellent service makes the hotel unforgetable we will be happy to return
Wonderful location and a magnificent hotel. The service was excellent and the Palace Wing is very comfortable. The place oozes with History and you can see why this Hotel is favoured by  famous people.
"The hotel is excellent, the employees are willing always to help you. I recommend it. BUT please take note, that if you have a flight and must leave before 6 o'clock in the morning, they won't provide you with a trip breakfast without additional costs, although  the buffet breakfast is included in your stay. This situation never happen in other hotels  when similar conditions take place."
From the very moment you enter this place it's a royal treatment with personnel attention. Place is beautifully done and when we visited during Christmas time it was decorated to the season. This place is huge but attention to detail is top notch and staff is ready to help and do their best to make sure you are happy. We had two rooms booked for a night and when we got our rooms one of them was a smoking room. We requested that we would like to be placed in non-smoking room they not only found us two non-smoking rooms on same floor but got us one room with ocean view and moved us in no time. Matter of fact we had US passports and they never asked us for a deposit hold or our credit card numbers just in case. (We were paid in advance). In short you can keep writing but have to
"We enjoyed High Tea as part of our Intrepid Food Tour of India, and it was one of our highlights. If you cant afford to stay there, then go for the High Tea which is awesome, with excellent dishes and a vast array of desserts. We left feeling very full indeed."
"I travel a lot, for business and for pleasure, thus I have stayed in hotels world wide. I have been to a lot of 5 star facilities in Indian, I felt good staying at Leela Goa, the last vacation I had few months ago but Taj was mesmerizing..... I am short on words to explain the stay. Its not about the facilities or the services, but the History of the place. The hotel was built some 113 years ago and they have done an excellent job displaying it to the Guests. The very first channel on TV is history of Taj, you need to see that and dont forget to take the Facility tour at 5:30 in the evening. You will walk the stairs once Gandhi Ji and numerous Kings, Queens and celebrities walked on. Put it on your Bucket List. :) Oh and make sure you book a Sea facing room, My room 505 had an"
"The hotel is very old and it has an opulent colonial feel about it. Security is tight, so before you can even enter the building you and your luggage is security scanned. The welcome inside is very warm. We were offered garlands round our necks and a welcome drink. I stayed in the Palace Wing of the hotel on the 4th floor. The higher the floor, the higher the price - but basically all of the rooms are pretty much the same size. The two views are sea view or city view. The view of the Gateway of India is obviously the most prestigious to have, especially from the 5th or 6th floor. The rooms are very comfortable. As you would expect from a 5 star hotel, safe, mini-bar, tea/coffee making, turn down service, bathrobes, slippers and free wifi. The hotel has a few restaurants -"
"My husband and I travel extensively and stay in many many hotels.  I do not think I have ever entitled one as ""Flawless""! For such an enormous hotel, this ran like clockwork.  We were made to feel as if we were the only residents! The staff, the ambience, the room, the food - everything was amazingly wonderful!  As we were going to the room after check in something fell out of my bag.  we retraced our steps but could not find it... the staff could not have been more concerned and within about 15 minutes it had been found and returned to me!  Our room was beautiful with a lovely view of the pool area.  We ate dinner by the pool: a BBQ meal of fish. This area is for residents only. The whole sitting/eating area was beautiful and the service and the food were perfect.  It is so"
"I had a wonderful experience. I initially wanted to reserve a tower room with a ocean view but it was fully booked so I opted for city view.  Upon checked in, I was told I was upgraded in the palace.  The room was beautiful but it had no window.  I will make sure next time that I have a window in my room.  It was very strange and bit sad too to not have a window to look through but the room was beautiful, service was great as usual.  I'll be back of course."
Truly remarkable incredible exquisite precise site. Go early and avoid the crowds. Wander the grounds and look at The Palace from different view points. Take it all in. It's a New 7 wonder of the world!
"As a GM of Relais & Chateau hotels in Sri Lanka I can confidently say the following.........There are good places and there are places that will last forever and a lifetime in your memories. If in India opting for the Taj is the best choices one can make. We came for a 5 day stay to celebrate my wife's birthday and it was so worth it.  If you get a chance to celebrate something do it at the Taj Mahal Palace. Rooms stunning, Service great, Details on every corner. Taj Club includes High Tea, Cocktail hour.  We had the Casablanca room for the celebration which is the most iconic, most private and most enjoyable experience you will have at the entire Taj Mahal Palace. I won't tell more.....go to the Souk Restaurant and ask for the Casablanca Room. If they allow you in you will be"
"Loved every moment of our stay here. It's pretty much perfect.  Service couldn't be better - if I were to mention every member of staff who was simply delightful, I'd run out of space. Everything about this hotel is of the utmost elegance. In particular, the floral displays are quite wonderful.  Cleanliness is second to none, and just when you think you can't be surprised, another touch will be revealed to you - eg fresh bookmarks inserted into your books while you're out, if you can believe that! The only downside of this marvellous hotel is that it is rather difficult to make yourself get out to spend time in the city. It's very tempting to be inside the whole time. We were there one week, but I felt I could have done with several more! I simply can't speak highly enough of"
"Unfortunately i was disappointed with the service and quality received at the Taj, I have stayed there before many times and i wish the standard were kept, but my overall experience this has made me regret staying there again."
"As is known, Taj Palace is a prestigious hotel and an iconic place in Mumbai. Its location is great, has rooms with great view of Gateway Of India and Arabian Sea. Its employees provide very good service associated with Tata name. We stayed there to celebrate an occasion recently but the experience was not perfect. Initially the room we were given was having old carpet, not upto the mark and was not properly prepared with a few things missing. Later, upon request, after some insisting, they changed the room which was fine. We had been here many times for Lunch and dinner but this was the first time we stayed here. Great breakfast and overall good experience at the end barring initial experience of the room."
"We stayed in the Taj Mahal Palace 2 years ago and vowed then to return. This stay was every bit as good as the 1st. Last time we stayed in the Palace Wing overlooking the water and Gateway to India which was stunning. This time we booked a Club Room in the Palace Wing. The view was not quite so good but still very pleasant as it overlooked the beautiful swimming pool. Included in the deal was breakfast in the Sea Lounge although on the 2 mornings we were there the queue was so long to wait that we didn't bother. All Palace Wing guests can use the Palace Lounge where there is free tea, coffee and soft drinks all day but our deal also included afternoon tea, early evening cocktails and canapés plus late night cognac and chocolates. We felt that we got a good deal. The hotel is"
"The Taj Palace Hotel is a truly iconic building.The view from our balcony of the India Gate and the harbour was totally amazing. Sadly my wife and I could only stay one night , we hope to make another trip to India either later this year or early next year and we will stay much longer!"
"Forty years ago I used to be a long stay resident of the Taj Mahal Hotel. It was one of the best, if not The Best, hotel I ever knew. But now it is much more. The decor of the rooms has been dramatically improved, the courtesy of the staff, at any level, has reached top levels and the attention to the details is beyond imagination. You really feel to be a welcome guest and not just a customer to be treated with courtesy. We were so impressed that we decided, from now on, to spend every year a week at the Taj."
"If you want to experience the Royalty, please visit the Taj Mahal Hotel Mumbai and you will not be disappointed at all and would want to come back again and again to enjoy the Royaly and very warm hospitality of this great iconic hotel"
"Clean, Beautiful Architecture outside and inside with great history. Great number of restaurant's and food was exceptionally especially the Dosa's at Breakfast. The staff in all departments make this hotel exceptionally. Can't wait to get back to Mumbai and the Taj."
"Stunning hotel with great architecture and fabulous pool area but the rooms are dated and really need a proper refurb to justify the prices charged - it's probably 3.5/5 overall. Everything is very expensive - all at Western 5 star prices, as soon as you step outside of the hotel, you realise quite how much you are being overcharged.  Staff are lovely and can't do enough for you.  We looked around a couple of other top hotels during our stay and on balance we would return here despite the reservations mentioned above."
"Walking distance from Gateway of India. Nicely built building and Opposite to the the Arabian Sea.Worth to visit as many attractions are concentrated in this area including Gateway of india, the Marine Drive, Mannat lands end, Galaxy Apartment..."
We had a Wonderful stay at THE TAJ. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary. A truly memorable one. specially due to the number of pleasant surprises in store for us…I would recommend all to experience their hospitality. clearly very well trained team..
"We stayed here for 5 days and really enjoyed it. I would return tomorrow given the chance..Great rooms with view of Gateway of India. (They told us we had been upgraded to the Palace wing, but we had actually booked this...). The staff are really friendly and helpful - special mention for the Pool Team and the superb Anil, who serviced our room! The Pool area is beautiful. We ate at both the Souk and Masala Kraft  - both were excellent.  Only one issue - the Harbour Bar would not allow us in with my son and daughter - they are 20 and 23 years old!! For some strange reason they have made this an over  25 bar - so although we stayed for 5 days, we never got to have a drink in this famous bar!   Within walking distance are the Indigo and the Table restaurant  (went 2 nights) - both"
"The Taj Hotel is exactly as its name indicate, a palace. The service is fantastic and the hotel amenities are really good.  Our room was extremely clean and the hotel staff name sure that we had everything we needed.  The hotel has everything you might need, a great pool, delicious restaurants and a spa.  The breakfast buffet was also really good. If you are thinking to book there do it, it is definitely worth every penny!"
"Booked in today - always wanted to come. The taj has lived up to our expectations- asked for a view of the gateway see picture - couldn't be better, breathtaking. Had advised on booking it was a birthday trip- see the picture- balloons and petals all over decorating the room plus when we went out exploring we returned to find a beautiful birthday cake and flowers. If you can go to the taj for exceptional customer service in every aspect "
"We are inhabitants of the city since three decades and its always a dream to spend a night at the Taj Mahal Palace, the best part of the city overlooking the majestic Gateway Of India. We just wanted a small break from the city life to celebrate our special occasion and thought of spending a night here. Trust me its the most beautiful experience if you want a break in the city away from all the chaos at the same time being in the city. We were upgraded to the Palace Wing, and how beautiful they had decorated our room with attention to every small detail that any perfectionist in the hotel industry would be proud off. Staying in this iconic hotel is an experience in itself. We were escorted to the room by the hostess who explained us about the various restaurants and things that"
Such a wonderful hotel with all the luxury trimmings.  Breakfast was lovely and plenty of choice.  The staff are so polite and nothing is ever too much trouble.  Booked a room in the tower wing but upgraded to palace wing.
"I was in awe when I entered this hotel. The beautiful & colorful flower arrangements, the paintings, the marble tiles floors, the waiting areas and the weeping wall just captivate all my senses.   I was grateful that they offered a tour of the hotel because it has a lot of history. We managed to see the Old wing with it beautiful architecture, lovely paintings and lots of photographs with famous personalities who had stayed in this hotel. As I heard about the 2008 attack, I realized the weeping wall was a memorial to the guests that died that day, it was done beautifully!  There was also the pool area with beautiful greenery, unfortunately we were on tour and didn't have time to enjoy this oasis.  My room was impeccable, done in a modern design. The location of the hotel was"
"A wonderful  hotel , On arrival we were upgraded to the palace from the towers , The trip was for my birthday our room was decorated with balloons and flowers petals on the floor they brought us a lovely cake nothing was to much trouble all the staff here make you very welcome , We had a lovely celebration  meal made special by Azar khan in the shamiana restaurant , Do go on the hotel tour as its very informative , The Hotel is in a great location and a lovely shopping street at the back of the hotel . We would recommend to anyone many thanks to all the staff who made our last days in India special !!"
"ive never written a bad review on any place, activities or restaurant. I am extremely sad that I have to write one. I don't think I have ever been that badly treated. We ask for a later check out and agreed with the reception desk on a price and a time. Somehow the hotel staff had a different time in mind and decided us to charge us for the full amount. Realising their mistake, they started bargaining!!! and didn't want to go back to the original price. I just don't understand how it ever happens."
"Taj hotels never cease to Amaze me and this time around they took it to a different level. Like i mentioned in my previous review, Taj always abide by the famous Indian ""ATITHI DEVO BHAWA"" tagline.  As always, i was welcomed by a tika on the forehead followed by a garland. The check in process was smooth and quick. Staff was friendly and wore a smile on their faces.  This wasn't a hotel but a palace in the true meaning. The hotel lobby is grand, so the first impression of the hotel gives the feeling of the palace. The hotel also arranged a tour to take around the property and explain the rich history. The tour happens everyday at 5pm.  Staff paid attention to even the minutest of details to amze the guests (pics attached).  The breakfast menu was huge and had lots of options"
"My family and I have just come back from a four night stay at this beautiful hotel and once again I cannot recommend it highly enough. It has been two years since our last visit which we had also enjoyed immensely. The service is seemless and the décor throughout is stunningly beautiful and tasteful without being over the top. Nothing is too much trouble. My wife had a problem with her Blackberry and the someone from the hotel came within 5 minutes to fix it for her eventhough the issue had nothing to do with the hotel.  The whole hotel is wonderfully regal without being pretentious. We had breakfast,lunch and dinner most days in the hotel sampling different restaurants and all were excellent. As we had been staying in a Club room, we had access to the Palace Lounge  which is"
"Quite possibly the best hotel in India and one of the best that we have stayed at.  Pure unadulterated luxury from check in to check out.  Multiple restaurants, this hotel sets the highest culinary standards.  You can choose from Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Eastern Mediterranean and western influenced food.  The Taj has the first bar in Mumbai and overlooks the Gate to India and the Arabian Sea."
"We stayed this month at the Mumbai Taj Mahal. There are really two separate hotels, one hotel built in the 1970's (we were told) called the Tower and dated and the other hotel is a classic. The Tower room was small and was in need of a paint job. We were on the 4th floor with a ""superior city view."" Actually the view was of the cab stand and a public toilet. We travel with a sound machine so the noise was neutralized.   The room included a breakfast which was wonderful with a complete mixture of western and Indian foods. The concierge services were excellent and they directed us to a wonderful local seafood restaurant.   If you stay in the Classic Hotel you should have a nice stay but if they put you in a Tower Room, it will remind you of a discount chain hotel."
"Stayed at the Taj with my wife.  Great service, great ambience, the pool area is spectacular for a city hotel, the gym / spa are very good and there is a great selection of restaurants.  Only two areas to improve are the car unloading area that is too tight and the air conditioning in our room (in the old part of the hotel) left a musty smell in the room."
"One of the finest 5 star property not just in Mumbai but India. Situated bang opposite to India's landmark 'Gateway of India' makes it more special. Unfortunately, it's status made the ISI to target it during the 26/11 attack, but don't worry the security is top notch making it the absolutely safe for your stay. This is still evident by the fact that one can spot many foreign tourists and visitors who choose 'The Taj' above all the options they have with Mumbai.  A must see and a must visit whenever you visit Mumbai. "
"The Chinese restaurant was fantastic... service amazing... food perfect... great selection of wines. A lovely treat in a great location. Ideal for friends, family or couples. A better afternoon could not have been had."
"As usual I stayed in the heritage wing.  The standard of hospitality remains very high.  Breakfast in the Sea Lounge is a great start to any day.  The hotel now seems to be more for tourists than for business people, but that is not a problem as all the business facilities are there.  I will go to this hotel as often as I can!"
"The standard of service and the ""experience"" provided is beyond compare. It has such a calm and welcoming ambience from the moment you enter it. Outside the hotel is a busy city and inside is a piece of history, culture and many stories. Needless to say that the standard of rooms and bathrooms is up there. The service at this place would leave other five star establishments far behind. They have done a great job is showcasing Indian culture and story telling combined with luxury stay. Pick any restaurant and you wont be disappointed. It is pricey but the experience shows why people see value in it."
Amazing and historic property of India loved the location India gate is simply beautiful in the front of the hotel the location of the hotel is simply amazing and the place where 11/9 actually happened loved the atmosphere of the hotel amazing property loved it
"My best stay for a long time , Unimaginable service right from check in to check out....Made me feel really special on this visit...I would highly recommend to stay at this hotel even if you have to pay slightly more than the ones on the same road....worth every penny."
"The sense of history and grandeur hits you immediately on arrival. This is Mumbai's oldest and grandest luxury hotel where nothing is too much trouble. The reception is elegant, cool and welcoming. There is also a beautiful memorial to the 2008 terror attacks.   The rooms are spacious and air conditioned with a well stocked mini bar and an iron (thankfully!) The beds are very comfortable and there's a mosquito net over the balcony.   There are a host of restaurants and boutiques inside the hotel. I would recommend Souk on the top floor. A delicious fusion of Mediterranean and North African cuisine. The Harbour bar is another Mumbai first with a very relaxing atmosphere.   Try to have breakfast in the Sea Lounge on the first floor in the old part of the hotel if possible. It's so"
"As much as I love the juxtaposition and love/death/joy/horrific of India, when I first arrive, I am still stunned at the pollution and grit. On this trip, I was treated to a stay at the Taj and I cannot express with the gratitude and delight walking through those doors into this sumptuous place I felt. First of all, this place feels like a page from Out of India. Gracious, historical, elegant, civilized. We stayed in the Palace part (not the tower) and were somehow upgraded to a grand suite called the Dutch Suite. Ironically enough, that is my surname and I thought it amazing they engraved a door plaque with my name. Ha ha ---! I am not kidding when I say that we walked into a 6-room apartment. A living room with leather and silk sofa and fresh flowers, a dining room with fresh"
"We spent two nights at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. We were late arriving due to a flight delay and when we booked in, the receptionist kindly upgraded us to a suite. This had two toilets and showers, a large lounge, a separate bedroom and a dressing room. A complimentary bottle of wine was present in the room together with fresh fruit. As residents in a suite, we also had a complimentary cocktail before dinner and a complimentary 'night cap' before bed. A specific room 'butler' was allocated to us -although we only saw him once [shortly after arrival].The food in the hotel was excellent, the swimming pool was great with helpful attendants and, without exception, all the staff were pleasant and helpful. It proved to be an excellent, luxurious start to our time in India."
The hotel is located at the prime centre of the city. The service is excellent. Room is very comfortable. I like every thing about this hotel. It is an experience. Wouuld love to stay  in this hotel any time. Breakfast is lavish & has all varieties of the world. And the chef is always a obliging to prepare any thing the guest like to have. It has several restaurants in the hotel & very close to lot of shops & amenities. It is a very exclusive & luxury hotel. Love the hotel overall.
this is a beautiful hotel to stay...luxury at its best....service is too good. The lobby is a bit crowded at times. We were treated to a warm welcome on arrival. the breakfast is excellent. Rooms are very spacious.
we were spending two days for a reunion. the hotel staff were very welcoming and attended to all our requests immediately. reception staff also very efficient. we were upgraded and again very helpful when I wanted to use different payments forms to settle my account. the restaurants were brilliant. Our reunion meal was in the Chinese restaurant where the food and service was excellent. Hotel has also a lot of other recreational facilities. would thoroughly recommend it and will always stay there whenever I am in Mumbai.
"We are returning guests to the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai. Having stayed numerous times there over the last 8 years, I can attest the hotel being a worthwhile stop over. Overlooking the Gateway to India in the heart of historical Mumbai. Great restaurants, wonderful staff, an institution in itself and a peaceful reprieve from the hustle and bustle that is wonderful Mumbai!"
"Two couples, well traveled, stayed at Taj Mahal Palace.  Location is good.  We stayed in the ""Tower,' the new portion of the hotel.  Our room was quite disappointing.  Small room, not significantly different than any mid priced American chain.  Overlooking the public toilets next door.  The Heritage part of the hotel, the well known dome, had beautiful public spaces, and seemed to serve a higher grade of guest.  We had dessert in Sea Lounge in the Heritage part, and this was terrific.  Overall, disappointing."
We had a very comfortable stay at this hotel. Nonetheless the service was remarkable including their front desk and restaurant staff. The hotel staff just made us feel so comfortable and never gave us a chance for any demands. Rooms were beautiful with the view of the gateway of india and very clean. Breakfast was good with no complaints at all.  
"We stayed 4 nights at the Taj and wasn't disappointed , on arrival we got upgraded to the 3rd floor , our room was lovely with a huge bed and all facilities that went with it even a morning paper...breakfast was superb , we really enjoyed the pool area, so relaxing and large padded sun beds , i can't prise the staff enough, we will be back...."
"A chance to stay at Taj Palace - the Heritage Hotel - shoild not be passed up. The ambience is lovely, though the views from the rooms are not all that great if you are not in a sea-facing room. A very comfortable stay."
"OK, a bit of hyperbole. But, truly, this is luxury at its best, and in US $$ quite affordable. The ultimate in service, from arrival to departure. Never condescending, always cheerful and helpful. A museum itself indoors, gorgeous breakfast dining outdoors poolside.  Great location, beautiful at sunrise and sunset and all day long. Can't wait to return!"
One of the best hotels I've ever been to. Try to catch the historic atmosphere by booking a room in the palace wing! Only the price/value relation for food and beverages could be improved in my opinion.
"It was my second stay, a work trip and I travelled on my own!   Landed late on Sat, Feb 11 and Gagan from the front desk was so helpful, I decided to stay at the Palace Wing, on the Club Floor and that gave me the Lounge access!   The staff in this charming heritage property was amazing, courteous, attentive and so caring!   I love breakfast at the Sea Lounge, especially when sitting by the window and enjoying the lovely view! I will miss this place a lot! Food is really good, the Wellness Blast juice, so good and healthy!   I also joined the 20 min yoga in the morning at 7:30am to start the day!   What touched me most was a meditation session I had with Shiresh, the Jiva Spa Director! Love his approach and delivery, and would be a very strong reason to be back, and for more!"
"Iconic hotel with top class reputation but unfortunately a let down in the end.   Rooms in the Palace Wing were good, if a little outdated. Service was generally good however, most could not be bothered to put themselves out and some missed the basics altogether.   Breakfast: So busy you have to wait for a table most mornings, then on one one occasion we were taken to a dirty table. Most buffet items kept replenished but some not (smoked salmon, Bircher muesli, french bread for example). Some unhelpful waiters (one even walked off after only taking part of the order and it took three requests to get a cup of tea). Food was OK, but one order for poached egg was delivered with lukewarm tomatoes.   Wifi: Good in the rooms, non existent on the staircase were you queue for breakfast"
My husband and I have just spent a wonderful week at Taj Mahal Palace hotel and feel completely relaxed and spoilt by the hotel staff. Thanks to every member of staff who looked after all our needs so well. Breakfast was delightful and some of the best pastries to be found anywhere in the world! Indian foods were also a delight; dosa for breakfast with so much choice. We will be back.
This hotel is the perfection. Welcome. Service. Atmosphere.  Confort. Excellent food.  Every details is thought of by the managing team.  The concierge team is incredibly helpful and Satish the head concierge is a star himself. He is so competent and resourceful that other concierge should learn from him.  If you are a regular at the Taj Mahal Hotel you will be treated like a Queen or King.  They know all your preferences and will make everything to make your stay perfect.  The travel concierge are also excellent.  The atmosphere is always busy and you are never board watching the buzz.  I have coming here for 14 years and will keep coming. 
Fantastic place well situated friendly staff I could not find one fault .As it was my wife's 60th they upgraded our room gave her flowers and cake it was amazing can't thank them enough can't wait to go back.
We had an amazing experience at your beautiful hotel. The magnificence and opulence of an age gone by is still very much apparent as we strolled around the grounds. The fragrant scents of fresh blooms will stay with us forever. The staff were all incredibly helpful and polite and welcoming - we loved the poolside yoga with Shahid. We are very grateful for the upgrade we received as we were celebrating our anniversary - Thank you Taj Mahal Palace - we look forward to staying with you again
A masterpiece in mumbai where one must visit once. Very nice food quality and nice place for meeting. The ambience is at the best very nice and cordial staff. I like a lot to being at taj it is the best place to be once in a life time experience.
"I was lucky enough to attend an event at the Taj Mahal Palace, and would love to go back. The ballrooms are grandiose and gorgeous and the hotel itself is filled with charm. Absolutely recommended for a stay, or even just a meal or high tea. "
"We had three nights in the Tower (amazing views of the Gateway and ocean) and one night in the Palace.  The Tower room had floor to ceiling windows so magnificent views.  The Palace was more like the 5 star plus, but not such good views.  The facilities are the same whichever you stay in.  Magnificent 31 metre pool and lovely surrounds, great buffet breakfast.  The staff were beyond amazing (especially Harsh and Ravi).  Forest Essentials to buy in the foyer!  Good food (if expensive in the Indian restaurant).  Easy walking distance to a number of good restaurants.  Shops - essentials are FAB INDIA (near to Taj) and Anokhi (near Gandhi museum). Only complaint was environmental policy - we were offered PERRIER water shipped from France.  Towels and bed sheets changed daily - no"
"The best part of my holidays in India all the way from London was the stay at Taj Mahal Palace. Its part of many stories and history. I chose to stay at the heritage old part of the Mahal property and I was luck enough to get the booking done on one of the unique suite 'the Primrose suite'. the suite is unique and many celebrities have stayed in that rooms so I felt lucky to be in that category. The service , room amenities and the  staff at hotel was just exceptional and cannot be explained with simple words. You have to stay there to feel that experience which I can confidently say is the 'best around the world' especially when the hospitality is concerned. I can't wait enough to come back to the property again....another luxurious holiday."
"Very good restaurant, I would say classical Indian restaurant with well prepared staff. Elegant decoration, tasty dishes. If you want to impress or taste the difference - it's your place. However, expensive, not for all pockets."
"I stayed here for six nights to attend a family wedding. I was lucky to be upgraded to a sea facing room on the fourth floor in the old palace building. The view was amazing, the boats, the gateway to India. The service from check in to check out was top class. The swimming pool was lovely although the area is in the shade from mid afternoon but in summer this would be a relief. The breakfasts were simply delicious and there Is a choice of three different places to eat and the chefs are willing to prepare any extras that are not available. Well worth staying here for a treat!"
"After your arrival and till check, every thing is seamless. Every facility required for business or leisure is available. The hospitality is royal, variety of restaurants are available for all tastes.  Spending few hours, both during the day light and during night , at  the roof top restaurant is must to enjoy the Arabian sea and Mumbai skyline. Advance reservation for a table is advisable. The variety of drinks with moderate pricing. If you plan well, can take advantage of happy hours, where they offer one on one.  Over all a must stopover if you love spending few nights in good hotel in India or abroad."
"In November 2016 and January 2017 I dined a number of times at this hotel.The experience each time was just perfect.The ambience was excellent,the staff were super friendly and professional and the choice of food was first class.I had Afternoon Tea a number of times and dinner on one evening.This is the best place,surely,to dine in all India.....I can recommend it most highly and easily give it ten out of ten."
by personal recommendation we booked the taj to wind up our tour to the golden triangle. it is expensive but we feel it was absolutely worth it. it truly is a unique experience. the position means that all the important sights are within easy walking distance too. the team there are of the highest order.
"Truly one the most elegant, beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in, with above-and-beyond service from the concierge desk onward. An absolute must for visitors to Mumbai! The outdoor terrace/pool area is particularly lovely."
"From the first moment we loved Taj Mahal Palace, what a building ......  ALL personnel act and react in every situation very professional and helpful. The breakfast was exceptional and a fantastic start in the day, this also thanks to Eric who spoilt us. Our room was on 12th floor of the Tower Wing towards India gate and the bay. We had a large room that was very clean and quiet. In the morning what a view and sunrise we had when we woke up! After sightseeing it was very nice to lie in the comfortable deckchair by the pool in a beautiful green garden. As our flight left after 1 a.m. and we were able to use the spa facilities to freshen-up after a long day, this extra service was highly appreciated. When we come back to Mumbai we know where to stay."
"Would like to thank all the staff at the taj even down to the staff in the toilets near the main lobby , all the staff  where amazing and always  smiling   , this made memories for my wife alone with the staff and the service  Let alone the hotel , the room .And  the food all was stunning  But a big thank you to Taljinder Singh who made my wife feel like a princess with the upgrade , the room was what dreams are made for  If you want to make memories as I did for my wife then book this hotel and you will then see what a amazing hotel this is                 Massive thank you to all  the Taj mahal Place team"
"Had a few days in Mumbai and treated myself to a stay at the Taj Majal Palace: worth every penny! Location can't be beat. Had a room in the tower wing with an exquisite view of the Arabian Sea as well as all the creature comforts one could need:  the most comfortable bed and pillows, everything very luxe. What I saw of the Palace wing was spectacular. Breakfast buffet in Sea Lounge and lobby restaurant was delicious. Service from all -- concierge, front desk, housekeeping, restaurant staff -- was exceptional -- the best I've experienced anywhere in the world--warm, caring, without a hint of attitude: the happiness of their guests foremost on their minds.  A perfect stay at a legendary hotel."
Good Except Membership Coupen Provided Is Not Good As We Cant Redeem. Stay Is Good. Service Is Good. Location Is Good Room Cleanness Is Good. But The Membership Coupen Provided Is Not Worth To Members As Its Not Accepted In Hotel And They Says Its From Marketing Sides And Not From Inner Hotel Has Provided Is Making  Full To Customer Or Members.
"We loved our room with view of the ""Gateway to India"". Staff were excellent and friendly. However were disappointed with the pool area as the number of chairs to guests was poor. Liked the 20 minute non use of chairs they would be taken back if residents were or using them but did not like the fact that after paying such a price for hotel room you could not get a chair. Gym... though a lot of good equipment, no real service from staff. You had to ask for keys for lockers, gowns and slippers. No slippers to fit any person over size 8 feet, this needs addressed. Fantastic tea to rejuvenate after workout. Mobile phones not be allowed in gym or changing areas to make calls. Lastly would have thought a great hotel as the TAJ would have had own brand pens and a better range of tea in"
Stayed in a club room on the 7th floor in the old part for 3 nights.The food was delicious in all the restaurants  we ate in. All the staff had happy smiling faces which made you feel good. Had a lovely stay.
"The Taj Mahal Palace has 2 wings where the old wing is a historical building. Nice location where you can see also the sea and the Gate of India. The rooms however, at least at the new wing that we were staying at, were with quite a bit of a run down particularly the bathroom. My room faces the city side and was so noisy with cars honking and dog barking  non stop throughout day and night. "
I think this is a must when visiting Mumbai.  We visited the India Gate then went into the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and visited the coffee shop on the ground floor. (doesn't sound grand enough).  We had tea and Victoria sponge which was beautiful served and tasted wonderful.  The choice of teas is like a wine list with all the various teas identified and their characters explained.  We were in no hurry as we were just soaking up the atmosphere of the place but a few Americans around us were saying they were waiting too long.
"Have been to this hotel a number of times; the location next to the Gateway to India, on the seafront, with traditional style - fantastic. The furnishings are quality - the breakfast was fantastic. I had a room in the older part of the hotel - traditionally styled, but good quality.The public areas are beautiful.   Greeted with a traditional Indian welcome, a personal service.  The outdoor pool is nice with good service for food and drink around the pool.  The hotel is steeped in history, style and charm which oozes as you walk in. The clientele it attracts are quality too.  The drinks etc. are quite expensive - but to be expected.  A fantastic hotel experience. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay next time I'm back in India."
Exceptional Service. Huge selection at breakfast. Very convenient location. Beautiful common areas. A must experience for your visit to Mumbai.   Have done an excellent job with the newly renovated rooms. Nice to be able to open the balcony door for fresh air. Had some  lunch and dinner meals at Shamiana Restaurant. Very good.
As per my opinion is concerned this place is best to visit. Propel here are well trained and educated the management is very good than other hotels.i recommend viewers they must stay this place once. Atleast 
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Taj Palace.  We were greeted and registered in record time and our room was ready (we arrived at 9:30 AM) within a half hour (or less) of our arrival.  We had a lovely room (548 across the road from the sea and the King George V monument, and it was remarkably quiet during the night (free of the cacophony of car, scooter, and motorcycle horn blowing).  We had a very comfortable room, tastefully decorated and well cared for by the staff.  I've said in several reviews of hotels we've stayed at during our last three weeks in India that this country tops by far the hotel service industry, and the Taj Palace was no exception.  North American (perhaps world) hoteliers should all come to India to stay at higher end hotels to see for themselves what"
"The decor in the hotel is very refined & luxurious but the staff are all very welcoming with discreet but efficient service. We went for afternoon tea about 4pm and the first thing to do is select the type of tea you want from a long selection and then you can help yourself to the hot buffet food of chicken, prawns, fish etc, cold buffet with smoked salmon etc and even have a sandwich made to order with your own selection of fillings. The deserts/cakes were amazing and even though I dont have a sweet tea and normally ignore cakes I was tempted and the dark chocolate Death by Chocolate was all a chocolate cake should be. Amazing food, wonderful atmosphere (with a pianist in the background) and outstanding service make this an experience not too be used for the remarkable price of"
From the moment we arrived to our departure the care and courtesy received by everyone was exceptional. The concierge went above and beyond. The restaurants were very good and staff attentive. I recommend this hotel without reservation.Well located in South Mumbai with lots to see. I love this hotel and I love Mumbai.
"I have to clarify at the start that this is not an ordinary hotel, it is an experience on its own. It is a magical combination of history, grace and hospitality and my expectations were very high. We were not disappointed one bit. One uses hotels as a base to explore the city, an oasis to relax and be pampered. The Taj Mumbai was all of that and then some.    We traveled as a family of four and stayed in a suite at the Palace wing. The experience started right at the airport arrival, where the airport hotel representative was waiting for us with the driver. On reaching the hotel we received a traditional welcome and were whisked straight into the suite for check in.  We realized we were upgraded to a better class suite when we entered the door. The decor was magnificent with"
A very good hotel for staying it was a seven star hotel providing all luxurious amenities for you. Staff was very helpful and professional trained to be behave and handle the customer. Food was excellent i love taj. I always go there. 
"I have stayed at this hotel for so many years than I care to remember and never once found anything to complain about. The Palace is superb, the staff are first class, polite diligent and so professional. The facilities are second to none, restaurants, spa, shopping, Club lounges fantastic."
"At truly wonderful hotel with wonderful staff.Everyone is treated with a happy smiling member of staff and nothing was to much trouble. We loved it.We especially enjoyed the pool, gym and yoga and the breakfasts"
"All was perfect.  Service, Restaurant, Cleanliness, Place, History, Wi-Fi, Pool, Safety.   Staircase, Lobby, Business c entrum, Spa, Sauna, Restaurant by pool, Drinks, Meal,   Service in the room, newspapers etc."
"This is an absolutely beautiful property, with the most central location - rooms are divine, ambience perfect.  Only problem is that they seem to be under-staffed, and they struggle to deliver service on time, make sure you allow enough time for especially check in and check outs!"
"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this magical hotel? Every detail of my experience was perfect from when I was picked up at the airport to the ritual greeting on arrival through to when I was safely deposited there again with a wonderful member of Taj staff by my side to help glide me through check in. Every detail is thought  through here. Also, I was upgraded to a deluxe harbour view room, which was amazing!   The Taj itself is breathtakingly beautiful, with amazing artworks snd architectural details scattered throughout. I particularly enjoyed the tour of the buildings and their history, which is a must do if you have time.  I ate breakfast in the Sea Lounge on both the mornings, as well as having high tea there with a friend. The view of the Gateway and"
"amazing , historic , unique, fabulous and of course expansive but it s worth it this Palace is one of the India Symbol like the Taj Brand specialy for the Old Buildings! we were so lucky to spend 3 nights here on  632 coral suit, the Front Office Duty Manager was so kind and helpful like most all the staff as a suit customer we really enjoyed the special lounge with complementary drinks and snacks in so cosy ambiance the Palace has an unique ambiance it s like a museum, so beautiful Our suit was large and comfortable... be careful HK team we found lot of things behind the sofa ! every day our butler provides us a surprise... thanks for the bath with roses all was so perfect THANKS to make my dream comes true"
As a special occasion it's a great experience. From the moment you a greeted at check in with a blessing and a fruit juice you a treated like a Maharajah. The room and all the facilities are second to none and the overall experience is really special. The morning yoga by the pool was a great way to wake up!
"The Taj Mahal in Bombay seems to us to be slipping in its heralded service. We were not greeted as we were in the past, they are CHARGING for bottled water for breakfast, even though other Taj's don't, it is very congested. It used to be a unique experience I feel it is becoming like any other hotel. I previously would have given it a rating of ""Best in the World"" no longer."
"I found this hotel was crisp and polished. The staff is well trained to please and were certainly put to the test. Our first room had so much street noise and being under the weather I was not willing to listen to, they moved us to a higher floor. This room was nicer as well. Beds are comfy and welcoming. Sent my clothes out to be laundered in the morning, but a dress came back with a terrible stain. Called the desk and they rectified it within hours. I mean they hung my dress up, still warm, in the closet! Went to the spa which was amazing, and after enjoyed a nice light snack with friends around the pool. Service everywhere!  Even room service for hot milk, touched up a notch with a few cookies set on a silver tray, fell asleep very easily here."
The Taj Mahal Hotel.... Taj Mahal Hotel name is more than enough to visit in the hotel.. this is the most expensive hotel in mumbai and also one of the most expensive in whole India.. some photos of Taj hotel terrace with special permission taken for this review..  The view of Gateway of India is the just cant explainable..
"Anyone who gets the opportunity to stay at this hotel will not be disappointed. The service staff are incredible, accommodating. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The hotel is rich in history and beautifully decorated. The food is delicious. Seeing the sunrise is a must."
"Right in front of the gateway to India, this exuberant hotel is an unforgettable experience. Staff is well trained. History transpire from its walls, which have seen illustrious visitors. Great food too. This is not a hotel for those short of money. Some rooms smell a little mold. Overall, worthy staying. "
Excellent hotel in best location in Mumbai. Lovely grounds and architecture and pool. The restaurants and food of superb quality especially Wasabi Japanese  and Souk restaurants. The spa and gymnasium were not inviting and need updating to be of the high standard of the rest of the hotel.
"My wife and I had the most wonderful experience, we have stayed at some top hotels during our travel, but I was most impressed and we consider this as a trip of a lifetime finishing our trip at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel."
"Taj Hospitality has always attracted me, the Staff has been trained/groomed to give their best to the Guests. One is always addicted to the Indian Hotels for the overall hospitality, just Love it. Cheers to the Taj Team keep it up. Best Wishes."
"Excellent facilities with exceptional customer service , great attention to detail  .  The relaxing atmosphere makes it the idea place to unwind  and enjoy the luxury surroundings. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff ."
"We hadn't visited Mumbai before, so decided to stay at the Taj palace, as it's a grand old place and right where you want to be. It's always exciting to stay in such an iconic place, stunning reception lovely checking in ceremony, amazing view from our room, lovely little extras like bowls of water with roses in and scrub to revive our tired feet after a days sightseeing! Food is amazing, don't miss afternoon tea It's unforgettable. Wished we had stayed longer than two nights. Have fallen in love with this Hotel and Mumbai! "
"It was a second chance to better enjoy this time. But at end of the day it was a complete dissatisfaction after spending good amount for two night. Rooms are OK.  The butler service is fine. I was recognised well as Taj Platinum member on arrival. All kind of gesture was extended. The laundry quality is much much below standard. Being in prestigious property one expect royal like treatment but so far as guest relationship is concerned, that is completely absent. I was staying in the Palace wing of the hotel, that has too many rooms but the breakfast facility is shear inadequate. Long ques can be seen waiting outside without any seating arrangement. Guess if a royal person is asked to stand outside for 20 to 30 minutes for his turn. Fortunately I was without family this time and"
"What can be said that has not already been said - Perfection! I loved this hotel (speaking only about the older section): Charming, Full of Character, Great Staff, Beds for great sleep, large bathrooms with separate shower and tub, Comfortable, wonderful extras (Club Member Room had access to High Tea, Apero and After Dinner drinks - all well worth it). All of things are rather standard in a Grand Dame hotel, but the little extras make for a most unexpected stay.  We ate dinner at the Pool Grill Restaurant and were completely satisfied. Breakfasts were tasty and well presented. Slight issue with the lowness and softness of the chairs, more a sitting room than a dining room, but service was fine with good coffees, espressos and tea.  The staff truly makes for a wonderful stay"
"Probably the best known hotel in India. The building is one of the most elegant properties in Mumbai. We went for evening tea at the Sea Lounge the 24 hrs. Coffee Shop. Entering through the main entrance traversing through the impressive corridor we climbed the winding semi- circular staircase to the Sea Lounge. We selected a table near the many glass windows which overlook the Gateway of India and the sea beyond. One of the best views in Mumbai. The waiters are the old world. All elegance, efficiency and intent to help you select the best of the snacks. Both veg and non-veg have plenty of choice including many typically Indian delicacies. The drinks including many flavored teas are served in style in luxurious silver polished metal tea pots. The crockery has the same luxurious"
"My husband and I were very excited to stay here, having always heard about the signature ""Taj Hospitality"". However, everything we heard could not prepare us for just how phenomenal this hotel and every single staff member working here is. We were checked-in to the Tower wing by Glen Menezes and he was beyond friendly and helpful. He showed us around and also arranged for a special anniversary surprise in the room for us :) The next day, after mentioning to Glen that our room was slightly noisy due to an event happening outside (no fault of the Hotel), we were absolutely blown away when we were upgraded to a room in the Palace Wing. This added to an already amazing Taj experience. The hotel and all the rooms are beautiful and we enjoyed the heritage walk around the hotel. We"
"The moment you arrive, your cares drop away and everything is about comfort and relaxation. Of course you are fortunate to be able to afford it, but it is worth every penny. The sea view palace rooms are heaven with every comfort and wonderful room staff. Downstairs is heaving with visitors but the poolside remains a tranquil haven. The staff are superb. A truly Grand Hotel. Only small criticisms are  1. We experienced a wedding where the throbbing beat kept me awake - on the 4th floor - until nearly 4am. This is unacceptable. Turn down the amplification.  2. The pool peace was ruined on Saturday by a Dad playing loud pool games with a group of shouting and splashing noisy boys. Please have a rule of no games in pool and children to be asked to respect other pool users' desire"
The Taj Mahal Palace is simply breath taking. Beautiful as ever. This hotel has everything. It makes you feel like you're in a royal palace. The location is very good and the employees are also amazing. Always helpful when needed.
"This hotel is in front of the gate of India and just as important as it. Both of them are attractions for everyone, if you can't stay in it because it's out of your budget, try to at least go and have a coffee or a chai inside in one of their lovely saloons. A real experience at an affordable price."
This hotel oozes old world charm. The service you will receive here is top drawer. The staff are friendly well informed and the aim to please you. This is my second visit to the Taj. I will definitely be back.
"Lavish and beautiful property, warm staff and delicious food...this property has all that you need for a luxury stay.  Pretty expensive but worth the price...every moment spent here is special.  The staff will go out of their way to help, assist and serve you.  A must visit place!"
"If you are travelling to Mumbai and want to treat yourself, the Taj Mahal is the place to go. Right in the heart of the city, it is conveniently located and above all your stay will be memorable. Lovely fragrances and flowers will welcome you. Spacious and comfortable rooms to relax, divine restaurants!"
"We returned to the Taj after 43 years and it still has the same wonderful experience we enjoyed back then...the comfort, the extremely friendly staff , the location and the ambience within the hotel ...all the above is still there ..... we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. You feel like royalty and are treated as such while staying at the Palace section of the Hotel."
"We had two nights here and wished it had been seven. It is a lovely hotel and there is a lot to see and do nearby.  Our room, overlooking the monument and the ferry terminus was wonderful. Staff were very professional, particularly those in the Chinese Restaurant and The Sea Lounge who were as good as anywhere we have ever stayed be that  Raffles in Singapore, The Mandarin in Hong Kong or The Peninsular in Bangkok.  As in many Indian hotels, the high level of security slightly spoils the kerb appeal on arrival but once through the airport-style security, you are in to a wonderful lobby space.  Checking in is a powerful experience and you are then whisked to your room with the usual pomp of a good hotel.  We quickly took advantage of the hotel's central location and found the"
"We spent three nights at this hotel at the end of an Indian odyssey - it is absolutely amazing, not cheap but worth the money for a few nights' treat. We stayed in the Palace wing, where butlers are available for any needs that you have, and Palace services can be contacted at any time to make arrangements, provide alarm calls or any other service you could think of. The building itself is fantastic, with a wonderful central staircase, objets d'art displayed on the corridors, beautiful lighting, arcades, flower arrangements and general décor. Breakfast in the Sea Lounge was a comprehensive buffet, light lunches and snacks are available at the Aquarius lounge near the pool, the Shamiana restaurant provides all-day dining at reasonable prices, and if you want to eat something more"
"An oasis of calm in the hectic pace of Mumbai. Great location in the city. Excellent staff, very accommodating and eager to please. Beautiful architectural building. Restaurants are excellent-but as one might expect, expensive by Indian standards. They take security seriously here since that terrorist incident--and we felt completely safe during our stay."
"My husband and I spent three nights in the Taj, and I found it a bit disappointing  We were shown to a superior double room, and as soon as we walked in we could smell a musty smell We asked to change, and we were shown another room with the same musty smell We felt a bit intimidated, so we accepted the second room They tried to solve the problem with dehumidifiers, perfumed oils, but the first night I couldn't sleep I told the housekeeper about it, and she opened the window, used more perfumed oils, they gave us letters of apology, little gifts, they bent over backwards to appease us, but the smell never really went away, you just got used to it The hotel is beautiful, the staff are truly wonderful, it's a shame that the memory I'll always have of it is the musty smell of a"
"A walk around this hotels palace wing which does have a guided tour unlike any other hotel in Mumbai is awesome , taking you through the hotel's royal interiors of arthitectural styles . This fine luxury hotel has only gone from GREAT TO GREATER over the years in winning International awards due to its fantastic service quality across all segments . You are luxuriated throughout the day , wheather its going out for local sightseeing , indulging in ethernal spa treatments , relishing a gourmet lunch over looking the arabian sea / gateway of india or just relaxing in your stylish suite ..... well , you will be left spoilt for choice !.... to mention in particular , if you want and wish hours of utter bliss , the Jiva Spa is absolutely exhilarating . Another great stress buster are"
"The care given at the Taj hotel is just exceptional. The rooms are just beauritul, the food in every restaurant superb and the people provide one with outstanding service.  i will only ever stay at the Taj hotels."
"We had arranged to stop here during one of our days I Mumbai. It's a beautiful hotel that clearly caters to the diamanté heeled elite of the local population and also visiting travellers. The lobby was busy like Mumbai railway station The shopping malls that lead from the lobby to the rest of the hotel are eyewatering. We didn't see any rooms but went straight to the sea lounge for a snack lunch. Call me picky, but in a hotel that is the flagship of its group and one of the most famous hotels in the world...I don't expect to see food stains on the table mat! The service was neither good nor bad...it was all carried out by a smile less waitress who looked as if she'd rather be somewhere/anywhere else. All in all - quite dissapointing"
"Best hotel I've stayed in around the world. And the restaurants we enjoyed has great service good food and decent value for money. Despite its location and bustling footfall, you still felt very special as a hotel guest. "
Only negative was a box breakfast given to us because we were leaving before the normal breakfast hour Otherwise all aspects of the sty were exceelent but they should have offered to pay for breakfast at their 24 hour estauarant
"We booked a sea view room in the Palace wing but for some reason we were upgrded to a suite in the Tower when we checked in. It's said the type of suite was just launched about 1 week ago. As it had a marvellous view of the Gate of India and the seam, you would not feel dull even if you have to stay in the room for the whold day.   The only downside is there are too many people there. The lobby, restaurants are full of foreigners and local visitors. But the room's quietness can be assured."
"We ended our trip to India with a little self-indulgence at the Taj Mahal and loved every minute of it.  The hotel is a well-run oasis, the staff are very attentive, the room comfortable and we had a view of Gateway of India. It was perfect. My work has taken me to hotels worldwide for over 30 years and I can safely say that this is among the best I've stayed at."
"Excellent and thoughtful service! Had a really comfortable stay in a heritage site and overlooking the Gateway of India made the birthday celebration stay more enjoyable. As the hotel was undergoing some renovations and maintenance, there were gondolas outside the window though it did not pose any inconvenience while we were there. Loved the food and heritage of the hotel although some of the amenities did look like they could do with an uplift (e.g bathroom). Overall we'll definitely visit again."
"The three days in Mumbai were the last of a fabulous trip to India. Everything about the Taj Mahal Palace exceeded our expectations. From the welcome at the steps, the booking inat reception to the taking us up to the room was a wonderful experience"
"If this is n't among the top few hotels in the world I will be highly surprised. Service is exemplary, great staff, wonderful room overlooking Gate of India and the sea. Pool area is beautifully landscaped with shrubs and trees and is an oasis of calm in a busy city.  Marvellous hotel, first rate, wish I'd been staying longer!"
"Stayed one night at end of a 2 week tour before returning to the UK (this was one of the reasons for taking this particular tour). It truly is a fabulous place and walking into our room in the tower to the spectacular view of the Gateway to India was breathtaking. The room was large and beautifully appointed with door leading out to a small terrace/balcony. We had every amenity you would expect in a 5 star internally renowned hotel - and the first fully stocked minibar we had encountered in India.  We dined in the Souk rooftop restaurant and had a delicious,  if pricy, meal (£200+). The head chef is from Syria and it shows in the authentic food. Breakfast in the Shamiama restaurant was buffet style with a wide selection of choices and freshly cooked eggs. However not all was"
"Would award this a 6 star if I could. From the airport transfer to check in, everything was smooth, quick and comfortable.  This hotel goes the extra mile to make sure you have everything you need and will go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable.  Breakfast had a great selection, rooms were spacious, clean and always had lovely touches like putting my jewellery in trinket boxes for me or placing a glass cleaner cloth under our sunglasses.  The hotel itself is incredible and I would definitely recommend the guided tour in the afternoon.  Thank you for such a brilliant stay we would love to visit again!"
My wife and I have been fortunate enough to visit almost seventy countries and had the opportunity to stay at some of the world's finest hotels.  None of them exceeded in excellence the Taj Palace. When traveling one generally chooses the city first and then the hotel.  The Mumbai Taj Palace provides a world class experience and it is worth while to visit Mumbai just to stay there.
"This Taj property is five star in every way - one of the best in the world. We were upgraded to a suite when we arrived late and the sea facing rooms were all occupied. There were luxury appointments throughout, and the attentive butlers took care of our every need. This hotel is a treat for the eyes, dripping with history and furnished with elegant antiques. There are plenty of five star hotels in Mumbai, but this one is the landmark property and feels like the center of everything in Mumbai."
"From the time we left the airport, welcomed to India,shuttled to the hotel, fantastic warm welcome to the hotel, and what a stunning place it is. Pity we only had a short stay, as we were made to feel so welcome by everyone one, it was a fantastic stay"
"Spent 5 nights at this great property in January. It lives up to it's reputation as one of the finest 5-star hotels in the world. Great service! We were in the tower side and there was some renovation work going on, so there was some construction noise and smell of paint. The other side is definitely more upscale. Rooms are very modern and tastefully designed. Great location near the gateway of India!"
"This review is late coming but seeing as I have recomended the Taj Mahal Palace to all my friends and family, I thought it is time to review it here. Seven of my fmaily and friends stayed at the Taj Mahal Paance hotel for 5 nights for my hen party.    First of all we were upgraded to the main wing, and the rooms were light and airy and the beds so so huge and comfortable. The whole Hen group were given wonderful gifts such as bangles, bindi’s, earrings, and balloons in my room, as well as the Congratulations cake and the foot bath salts for all of us. It was truly magical.   They made us all feel so welcomed, relaxed and comfortable and nothing was too much for them.   I really appreciated all the small gestures, like providing me with a mouth wash when my own one was running"
"Excellent location, great view and very helpful staff. All our requests were met with promptly. We tried the food at Masala Kraft and Souk and both were excellent. Overall, one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had."
"Superb hotel would recommend everybody to have a lifetime experience.atmosphere at the hotel, swimming pool, the restaurants, the garden lounge, and not forgetting the memorial wal and the heritage tour is must very touching,stay at least for three nights."
"From the first moment when you enter the hotel, you get the feeling that your demands and wishes are seriuously taken care of. Interior dekor is oppulent and rooms are spacious. We stayed in the Tower Wing with its stunning staircase and beutiful views into the bright and broad passages to the rooms. Service is perfect and food outstanding. The only deficit is the noise of the nearby traffic at the poolside where you would wish to stay after a hectic day on Mumbai's streets."
"Lovely vintage historic hotel. The gardens with pool / afternoon tea and location setting are just stunning. Takes you back in time with its lovely architecture of the hotel and the care of its history with its very interesting ""hall of fame"" walk which highlights celebrity visitors throughout the past decades/ centuries. With the India gate right across the street a further highlight of Mumbai is right at the doorstep of this exquisite hotel. "
They forgot to send us a car to the airport although we have sent them the flight details When we arrived they did not welcome us like they do to everyone us ( Indian tradition) & we told the manager he said we don't do that anymore! Although i saw it in my face that they do the welcoming!!!!!!
"Loved every day of our 6 night stay. The whole hotel is lovely. Staff, rooms, pool area, restaurants, bars all brilliant and exactly as I was hoping for. Rooms are well equipped and the room cleaners leave little touches each day. Staff are extremely friendly and do use them to help with restaurant bookings outside the hotel. Food in restaurants was always excellent- the prawns on the pool bbq were divine.  Food and drinks are expensive but tbh we didn't care - we loved it all."
"The hotel was excellent with very good amenities. The pool area was nice for our family to hang out, cool off, and chill out. We also enjoyed the sit out area for some snacks. The wedding went off very well, the dinner and dancing with the live band was fantastic. The staff was always very friendly and helpful. Great place to stay!"
This is probably the best hotel we have stayed in.The whole place is immaculate with stunning architecture.Although the hotel is usually at full capacity it rarely feels crowded.  There are plenty of knowledgeable and well-trained staff that can help with any questions you may have
"Definitely one of the most sought after heritage place to stay in Mumbai, and even India. Liked the fact that they have done away with Check-in at the usual counters and instead take you to a lounge where Private Ipad Check-in is done. Though takes a few minutes, but you do not have to wait stupidly at the front-desk like a ""nobody"". Felt special.  Had an opportunity to stay in the Palace wing (Do try for the same). Even though the rooms were small, but they had a lot of character (and history). Pool was chilly in the month of January, but was well maintained. Liked their health Club which again was on a smaller scale.  Buffet Breakfast was one of the best I ever had and the sheer Vegetarian options were tooo amazing!!  Overall, a must experience if you are together celebrating"
"Me and my wife stayed here on 22nd Jan weekend. Staff was so generous specially Priyanka, they upgraded our room to the sea view room where magnificent Gateway of India was just in front of us. The history, the scale, the facilities, the staff, the location, the beauty, everything is something which make you feel you are a king or queen, for my wife's case, off course. Heritage walk, the food, the pool, just so amazing that you want to com again and again."
The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is excellent in all respects. A little expensive but I would suggest its worth it. It is well located in Mumbai close to a number of the main attractions of the city and therefore easy to reach.
"This hotel is my top of the chart hotel in Mumbai. Their service is top notch, staffs are friendly and helpful here. I have many tips around the area from the concierge.   Foods in here is excellent but abit expensive. As located in the tourist area the price tag seems to be reasonable. There is an Lebanon restaurant on the top floor if you like to try food from middle east."
"We stayed at the heritage wing of the taj colaba. Very comfortable rooms, nice bathrooms amd great services. The room service food is not that good  We ate at wasabi the japanese restaraunt which was excellent  The food and service of the chinese restaraunt Golden dragon was not good at all.   Pool side is fabulous and worth the experience.   Make sure not to stay at the tower wing as the rooms there are old dated and small!   Heritage wing was very nice"
"A BIG BIG shout out to Kristin and the team for our groups wonderful stay at The Taj to celebrate our friends 60th birthday,it was sheer luxury we were treated like VIPs. What made it special was the staff whose commitment to provide a quality service was second to none they were attentive to our every need. Our friend will never forget his 60th birthday and neither will the rest of the group it was truly memorable from start to finish and for that I thank you."
Words cannot describe the wonders of this hotel. and the dedication  of the staff .From arriving to leaving everything was fantastic .As it was our Anniversary they upgraded our club room to a suite and decorated it with balloons and flowers . Don't hesitate at all to book this hotel .Trust me you will not be disappointed.
"My daughter (14 yrs old) and I loved our weekend stay at the Taj Mahal Hotel. We particularly enjoyed the Heritage Tour, the Harbor and Gateway of India view from our room; the courteous staff, the tasteful vintage decor, and the sumptuous in-room breakfast. The welcome arti was also a nice touch :) We eagerly look forward to our next stay at the hotel. Thank you!"
Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai is so beautifully located and handpicked employees to look after each and every need of the guest. It makes you feel special and wanting to come again and again. I must say the employees are trained well enough to handle guest with smile.
"Wonderful clean hotel in Mumbai.  We were treated like royalty. Very impressed with the service. The place is full of ambiance,  and style. A fantastic location, truly the gateway to India. Good location for seeing Mumbai, answer such a peaceful place after the madness of the city."
We visited the Habourmaster bar. I can definitely recommend the Bombay Blazer as a cocktail. My friend said the Dark and Stormy was equally as good. Great service and surroundings. I would definitely return on my next visit.
"An imposing property with a heritage of its own, the Taj is second to none. The experience of staying there was also exactly like that - pulsating with its heritage, opulent and comforting. A traditional Indian welcome with a comfortable check-in is the perfect start. A host of dining options to choose from add to the luxury. My choice was the sea-side restaurant with live music in the evening.  The only criticism perhaps will be a little more care at the time of checking out, to match the welcome and the stay. Rest is perfection!"
"We booked the tower but got lucky at check in and were allocated rooms in the old palace, which is full of ambience and makes for a great place to stay.  The rooms were comfortable and well-appointed and had sea views.  The staff was attentive and friendly. The breakfast spread was merely very good, but it didn't matter. We think Colaba is the place to stay in Mumbai and this is the place in Colaba.  We'd book there again in heart beat."
"the welcome at the airport was nice and the driver very professional   my wife and i were both received at the taj mahal palace by Chirag, who checked us in, was very very very welcoming, and did the taj hospitality justice; what a lovely fellow Chirag  the taj central reservations was a disappointment because after talking to the person for more than half an hour over the phone and coming to an agreement, he didn't upgrade us  our reservations was for a city facing club room which later after an understanding over the phone was to be upgraded to a ""club sea facing room"" for a slightly higher price (we had even agreed upon a extra amount), but the reservations guy totally fouled up and was indeed a bitter disappointment   surprised specially being an innercircle ""gold"" member"
"Superb hotel with great staff always helpful and attentive. Our room was superb. Bar prices a bit steep though, top London hotel kind of prices. we had a free upgrade to the heritage wing which was great. Also lots to do around the local area with Bars, Restaurants and street shopping.Pool area and gardens well kept and relaxing area after a day out in the city."
Iconic hotel in fantastic location opposite the gateway to India. The historic wing houses rooms and meeting facilities and he tower wing additional rooms. If you are lucky enough to face the front of the building you will enjoy stunning views of the harbour and the gateway to India. Rooms are a good size with pleasant decor but they show the age of the hotel. Bathrooms have bath over the shower and are functional but nothing special. You will find more luxurious hotels in Mumbai but there is only one Taj Mahal Palace and the plaza oozes charm and character. Friendly staff Staff and good service in a great location and an iconic hotel. Works for me!
Beautiful Hotel.  Well decorated Lobby and restaurant. Great ambiance and hospitality by staffs. Food tastes great. The chef personally looks if we are satisfied with the food or not. The indian savories sweets are mouth watering.  Rooms are well decorated and a complete package.  Must consider to stay at this property.
"We stayed 4 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai and from the moment we entered we found the staff to be attentive and helpful. Their sincerity in ensuring that your every need is met inspired me to write this review. The rooms were spacious and clean as would be expected in a hotel of this caliber; however, the little extras such as a rose petal foot bath set out for you after a day out on the streets sets this place a notch above the rest. The restaurant staff are eager to ensure that you have an adequate supply of your favourites on hand (a whole bowl of my favourite fruit supplied immediately after asking!). This is an experience not to be missed!"
There are a few very good high end hotels in India.  But Taj Palace Hotel does have the history and the view of the Gateway of India going for them.  I would suggest that if you plan to tour Mumbai to stay in any of the south side hotels as most sights are on South Mumbai so easier to tour. Their breakfast is great with two options to take them.  Shamiana and Sea Lounge.  The service in Shamiana is slightly better as the staff are more alert and the coffee is stronger. Sea Lounge has the view of the Gateway of India but tend to have a waiting list.  The staff not as friendly unfortunately.  Join the 530pm tour of the hotel when you just arrive as this will give you a history of the hotel and also an overview of what the hotel offers.
"I had long wished to stay at this iconic property. Got 2 years back a chance to have a buffet lunch. Experience was not upto worth the expectations (Review already on Tripadvisor). This time finally got a chance to stay at this hotel on 23 Dec 2016. Biggest disappointment was entry itself. Hotel does not accept PAN Card as proof of ID. Hotel does not accept Govt ID (PSU) though only one Photo ID is required. Both are acceptable at airports which have much more security issues. It was only when Aadhar card was emailed, Hotel allowed to check in though  I was a Taj Innercircle gold member. What is the use of Frequent member card if hotel does not believe.  Initial room allotted to me was really hopeless with door bang opposite the bed. I was told that this was one room on each"
"I would just like to say that if you are ever in Mumbai, you must experience this place even if for just one night. I can honestly say that it is the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. From the initial welcome to the Chauffer driven car back to the airport, the memories will stay with me for ever.  Although a little more expensive, if you can afford it stay in the palace wing rather than the tower as the little suttle things that you get extra are worth it. i wont spoil the experience for you. Thank you to all at the Taj for a wonderful stay. we promise to return on our next visit to mumbai."
It is so great to see how this man make the love story will be for century coming. The only things are  not good  ticket for foreigner is 1000 Indian R and Indian people is 60 Indian. Take photos for memories .
"This was my first time stay at The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai with family. We were welcomed with 'Tilak' and 'Tulsi Mala'. It was the most wonderful stay. And Check in time almost 10 min only...!  had one of the most memorable experiences at the hotel. As the name say itself about all.  Thanks to the team for hospitality at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. And sure stay here whenever I will be in Mumbai. #PARENT Nashik"
"From arrival to leaving we were treated as true royalty in the Taj Mahal Palace. We have been lucky enough to travel a lot but no other hotel comes anywhere close.  We had booked a Club room for our 3 days as we wanted to take advantage of the Club Lounge but were upgraded in arrival to an Executive Suite. And it really was a suite! The breakfast in the Sea Lounge was excellent where the staff learned our names and knew what we wanted so we didn't even have to ask.  The Palace Lounge provides a quiet area to have daily afternoon tea, cocktails and post-dinner brandy and chocolates.  We didn't want to leave and would not even consider staying anywhere else on our next trip to Mumbai! "
"I first stayed at this hotel 48 years ago and have visited many times over the years. I have never been disappointed. This time we treated ourselves to a palace club room. Our stay was perfect. The staff are impeccably trained, the complimentary breakfast, high tea, evening drinks, one way transfer and late evening cognac and chocolates were wonderful, and we found the service from Chirag who welcomed us to and farewelled us from the hotel, and Leroy, in the club lounge, to be outstanding. Our room was beautiful and the surprise touches each day made for a special stay. I would come to Mumbai just to be spoilt in this wonderful hotel."
"We were fortunate to be given a room in the original building, one overlooking the hotel pool, a relaxing view. The bedroom ceiling must have been 20 foot high-we rated the bed itself the most comfortable we had ever enjoyed. Lunch on the patio by the pool in January temperatures was a delight. A query on our bill at check-out was handled promptly and with excellent good manners. Our two nights in the hotel were a stay to remember."
"I have stayed in Hotel for  2 days as I had got a good deal which you get most of the time during non peak season, Rooms are very good with very neat and clean Bed linen with all the amenities most of the rooms have very good view of Mumbai when taken higher floors."
This is a wonderful hotel to stay at but of course it comes at a price.  This was our second visit which in itself explains how happy we are with the complete experience the hotel has to offer.  From our meet at the airport to the time of departure the service did not faulter. I would certainly return again when in Mumbai.
"This hotel ticks every box for excellence.  Despite its considerable size, the service remains personal and slick. We stayed in the Palace section of the hotel which is full of character.  I cannot find a criticism to make in any regard."
"Right from the time we entered  hotel till we left we found the place full of warmth courtesy & luxurios. You start your day with a beautiful view of sun rise, gateway of India & great Arabian Sea. Buffet breakfast served was elaborate sumptuous & caters to the need of all. The warmth of the staff & service with a smile right from junior to Sr. Staff was heartening. The quality of food was excellent in all restaurant. One can have a tea  coffee or a drink in San lounge & the place is really relaxing.  Strongly recommend stay at this place while in Mumbai especially to foreigners as it is best suited to their requirements"
We started a 5 week trip around India with a few nights here. They have done a great job of the refurbishment - the rooms in the old part are charming - and in the new wing there are spectacular views of the India Gate. Drinks by the pool of an evening gives you some idea of the 1930s - although a G&T ordered by Mrs Beaver came to about $25 - so not for the faint hearted. Great Service - and a chance to stay in a great historical monument (the Indians come to take their pictures with it in the background)
"We spent three nights at the Taj Mahal Palace as the final stop of our 18 day tour of India.  What a perfect way to end a wonderful trip.  Arriving in the lobby gives one a sense of how things may have been decades ago and prior.  All staff were attentive to our needs and always willing to assist.  Our room faced the India Gate and was perfect in every way.  Breakfast was excellent.  After 16 hectic days on the road, The Taj was a welcome respite from the chaos of other parts of India.  After two long sightseeing days in Mumbai, we were welcomed to our room with a bronze kettle foot bath.  Location is great for walking along the waterfront and close to many highlights and shopping areas.  Next time in Mumbai we will be staying at The Taj and recommend others do the same."
"This very splendid hotel provides old world grandeur with the very best level of service, if you really want to spoil yourself then the suites are magnificent, however the new wing, overlooking the gate of India and the sea, is extremely comfortable. You will be guaranteed very friendly and reliable service."
"The Taj has a reputation that speaks for itself. On top of the amazing service and style, it was fantastic to stay in a hotel built by the Tata family: members of the Parsi community and great philanthropists. This hotel was apparently built when the owners were not welcomed by British society back in the day in 1903. It is also the first hotel in India to employ women. All great reasons to give it our support :)"
"The best way to experience Mumbai is to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. It has made it our top 5 hotels of the world. Impeccable service, attention to detail, beautiful rooms and wonderful flower arrangement. The Souk restaurant on the penthouse level affords a great view of the city and the Arabian Sea. The food was outstanding. The chef came over to welcome us. Close by to the old city and shops."
"Loved the concept of `Tajness’ – the Welcome, the suave check-in, the room, the butler, the feel of being at THE Taj property !  Consider me a `Tajaholic’ & the time spent at this wonderful property would be cherished forever."
"We recently stayed at the taj palace and enjoyed it thoroughly . From the minute we arrived we were pampered and looked after like royalty! The pool area is stunning  Afternoon tea is a must, as is the breakfast. Every day when I returned from a hot days sightseeing there was a cooper bowl of rose petals and relaxing salts to bath my feet in. This was our first trip to Mumbai so decided to splash out a bit, we did not regret it. You will find cheaper hotels but this is an experience"
"I love this place. The service mentality of the staff is beyond good. Nothing is too much where ever you are. The quality of the food is fabulous (it's very expensive but I'm not worried about that too much). I've been in both the old building and the tower (also not young but refurbed) and I personally prefer the old part /rooms but the view as I posted on the sea side is fabulous, especially in the morning at sunrise. Highly recommended!"
"This was the final stop of my Indian 'Treasures of the Raj' guided tour. We had already stayed in another 2 Taj hotels. Although this hotel is very large, there are smaller 'rooms' or 'areas' in the hotel that feel more comfortable. The pool is wonderful as is the poolside area. The breakfast choice is truly amazing. Very friendly helpful staff too."
"Taj hotel is a very very very good hotel at a very affordable price. There  are very good facilities here. There is good management system and has a great comfort. If you are in search of a good hotel,then ''TAJ HOTEL''  will be a great choice for you. THANK YOU!"
"Undoubtedly the only place to stay in Mumbai. The building is elegant and internally beautifully preserved. We have never before experienced staff so well trained. They could not have been more helpful in so many little ways without being overly present. Beautiful rooms,top class food. Our three nights here could not have been more enjoyable."
"This was supposed to be the highlight of our three week tour of South India, unfortunately the hotel was at full capacity which impacted on our stay.   We had to wait 20 minutes to be checked in without so much as a glass of water, let alone a welcome drink.  Eventually we were checked into a smoking room.  This has NEVER happened to us before, anywhere!  Surely any hotel should check on this most basic requirement, let alone the more upmarket establishments.   We were moved to a non smoking room, which unfortunately smelled of smoke.  Following several phone calls to the Duty Manager, and an uncomfortable nights stay we were eventually moved to a third room.  A very unsettling start to our stay was followed by the need to queue once again for breakfast.  The woman on the door"
"My Experience   1) Ambiance was good  2) Service was good  3) Rooms View was ok  4) We booked the hotel to celebrate my Anniversary which i told during the time of booking,  but surprising and sad part is no body wished us from Hotel side or asked for any special arrangement.    5) Rooms which we got were noisy and we are getting construction noise - which was not a great thing.  6) we wish to visit again and love to refer to our friends but now we are in double mind   Regards Punit Mehrotra"
"A beautiful hotel and a complete opposite to the chaos outside. Once inside, calm takes over and the relaxed atmosphere is infectious. It would be very easy to stay here and not leave the building. The pool area and Aquarius lounge are a great place to relax.  Breakfast was very good, it is a buffet with options for all tastes. Expect a short wait if it is busy.  The wifi worked throughout the hotel and was good enough for email and messaging. There is even an internet butler if you do run into problems.  A lovely stay in a Club King Room with Sea View in the Palace Wing. Tea served on arrival in the Palace Lounge whilst check in was completed. The room was well presented, with all necessary amenities. The bed was very comfortable, great stand-up shower and separate bath."
"Immediately upon entering the lobby, the comfort and luxury is palpable. The aroma of fresh flowers permeates the air, in contrast to the pollution outside its doors. The service upon check in and through was personable and impeccable. The spa was fantastic. I really could not have been more pleased with this hotel. If I were to have a complaint it is that the food and drink at the hotel restaurants were quite pricey but I feel its to be expected at a famous luxury hotel."
"We had the most fabulous time staying at the Taj. It is a wonderful hotel, fantastic communal areas and our room was very comfortable indeed. We received amazing service from the staff, everyone was so helpful. We would highly recommend a visit to Mumbai and a stay at the Taj, it is an exceptional hotel."
The Taj Mumbai is a wonderful experience. It's the only place to stay in Mumbai. Architecturally it is stunning inside - that staircase and also the art work all over the hotel is wonderful. If you can I would always stay in the original building. Fabulous service.  Breakfast by the pool. I ate in the Japanese restaurant and thought it was top notch - especially the staff. 
"My husband, son and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We were definitely feeling the ""Taj'ness."" It was definitely worth staying on one of the palace levels, as it came with one-way complimentary car service, breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails and chocolate and cognac. We took advantage of all of these except for the cognac and chocolate.  On my first day, I left my purse in one of lounges, not noticing until over an hour later. The staff had been trying to track us down (didn't have our room number), and ensured it got into the hands of security. This same staff made sure we were extremely well taken care of during the rest of our stay.  Everyone was genuinely wonderful.  Pros: - The best breakfast I've had at any hotel. There's a buffet, but they will make local"
"This stunning hotel was built around the turn of the 19th century and was largely rebuilt after a terrible terror attack some years ago.  It is now simply STUNNING. Nothing I write here will do it justice - I promise.  If you EVER get a chance to stay in the old section (known as the Palace) GO GO GO.  The service is exquisite and blew my wife and brother and I away. NOTHING was too much trouble.  The breakfast food was excellent, although we were visiting relatives, so didn't eat lunch or dinner here.  We indulged in the complimentary High Tea most days.  We luxuriated in the complimentary Cognac and Chocolates most nights after returning from visiting relatives (having missed the complimentary cocktails served after 6.30pm) I swam in the stunning pool each day - crystal clear,"
Staying at this hotel is a destination in itself.  From the moment you arrive you are treated  as an honored guest. We enjoyed the restaurant options and relaxing by the pool.  Wonderful stay and would definitely stay here again.
"the sevice was very good and the employees were very nice and polite and they allways ask you if you need any help, Also there are two employees were vrey good and i wanna thank mr Muhmmad -Husan amd Anil."
"We had two nights in Mumbai and chose to splurge. Our rooms were in the Heritage wing which is part of the old building. Stunning and tasteful decor is standard in this hotel. For a big hotel with so many guests, I was impressed that staff make the effort to remember your name and to take care of your needs.  We needed a hair dryer at 02H00 and all it needed was one call to the butler on our floor.  The restaurants in the hotel are very enjoyable. Special mention should go the Golden Dragon for a very enjoyable Peking Duck and the Shamiana (24 hour restaurant) for their chocolate mousse. (smooth and velvety).  A special mention to Nandini at The Shamiana for her very hospitable charm and manner.  Tip: The hotel offers a tour of the hotel every afternoon."
"Not the Taj hospitality I have experienced before. They gave us a Queen Bed room even though we booked a King. The guy who checked us in was trying to convince it was a King bed. Didn’t expect Taj to treat guests as if they don’t know what King bed looks like. It took them more than an hour to get us in a room with King bed. We had 2 small children so had requested a rollaway bed as well. They said it will be complementary at check in, but when we asked to be moved to the King bed room, the rollaway bed was no longer complementary and came at a charge of Rs 3000/night. I expect Taj to honor what they say or don't make a promise they cant keep. The final room was on the 3rd floor with the view of the Gateway of India. Located next to a tourist attraction comes with noise from all"
"Taj Mahal is a class by itself. Friendly, Professional service with a smile from arrival to departure. Staff are very polite and helpful, and always ready to assist in any way they can. Mine was rather a very short stay, but was not the first. Sea Lounge is a place where one can sit and get lost in one's own thoughts overlooking the sea."
"Staying at the Taj means it is easy to tick off one of Mumbai's most famous tourist sights - the place is iconic and steeped in history. Drink at the first bar licensed in Mumbai, chill out beside the large pool, revel in the superb service offered by extremely well trained staff....it would be easy just to stay in the oasis that is the Taj and not venture out onto the streets of Mumbai. If you can drag yourself away, the location makes it very easy to explore old colonial Mumbai. The Gateway of India is right next door and the general area has lots of fantastic old buildings filled with shops and restaurants.  The only downside to staying at the Taj is that it's such a tourist attraction that it's often crammed with people. There are resident only areas but the hotel was"
"Beautiful iconic hotel, excellent service.  Restaurants are outstanding.  The workout room has a personal trainer at your request, the pool is gorgeous, location excellent.  The staff is friendly, professional, most helpful.  High end linens on the comfortable beds."
"Fantastic location, fantastic room, fantastic staff...a wonderful place, a haven in the middle of a crazy city. Absolutely recommend.  Very nice swimming pool and spa area, great cocktails.  I was allowed to use the facilities on the day I checked out."
"we stayed at the taj palace hotel in Mumbai from the 27th December to the 29th December and we booked the superior King bed sea view in the Tower Wing. We were given a room overlooking the Gateway to India which was absolutely breathtaking. The room was of a reasonable standard however the hotel was being renovated and unfortunately this was right above our room. We did not mind initially as we were out most of the time, however the building work was going on until 10 pm at night and when we complained this stopped immediately. That same evening there was a strong unpleasant  chemical smell in our room and we reported this. The duty manager then moved us to another room on the same floor which was fine.  The next day Mr Taljinder Singh the Area Director and General Manager came"
"This place is stunning inside and out. It looks like a postcard from the outside and inside is filled with beautiful shops, great staff and service, and a few good eating options too! The lobby itself is a nice place to relax. "
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a perfect hotel to explore the city of Mumbai    It is large and is very busy , but works perfectly. The service levels are amazing and , staff continue to offer there assistance no matter what circumstance.  This is land mark and a true traditional masterpiece - it's a must visit.  "
"We stayed on two occasions, once in the main hotel and the second in The Tower.  All the rooms were fabulous but would certainly recommend spending a little extra and having a room in the main part of the hotel.   Its a very special hotel, with excellent service.  Nothing is too much trouble to make your stay special. "
"Stayed in this hotel for 2 fabulous nights.  The architecture was stunning in the older section and the new tower exquisitely ties in the charm with modern building.  The staff was friendly but NOT very accommodating, especially compared to the hotels where I stayed in the UAE - this is probably the one down side of this hotel.  As one example, I arrived early (4:30 am) to the hotel after an overnight flight from the UAE. I expected to pay for 1/2 day (checkin is usually 2pm), but the staff only offered me to pay a full night or wait until 6am to checkin."
"Mumbai is dreadfully polluted with smog destroying the view of the bay. I would never go back, and it has taken me time to review this famous hotel.   It is a beautiful old building with a wonderful staircase, and Massala Craft is a good restaurant. Otherwise grossly overrated, very noisy at night, very poor sleep.   The 24 hour restaurant on the ground floor was awful."
"One of the best hotel in india, great day, love your services, best food, funn chill great room inside a sea long time great experience good people's serve more serve great, think big, think more........."
"Simply one of the best hotels in the world. Wonderful, palatial public areas and rooms; service that is both professional and attentive; outstanding breakfast in the Sea Lounge; and the best location in Mumbai. You will not regret spending your rupees on this place and I guarantee you will want to come back.  The only down side is that food and berverage rates are very expensive, even by Mumbai standards. Probably set intentially so to keep the place exclusive."
"The Hilton at the Mumbai Airport was comfort and clean.  It wasn't as new and modern as some of the hotels were on this trip, but it was very nice, clean, and comfortable.   The staff was delightful.  We enjoyed their breakfast."
"Location: The hotel is in the heart of Mumbai right next to the water by the Gateway of India  Hotel: I stayed at the Taj on a weekend during a business trip. This is truly one of the most magnificent hotels I have every stayed in. Architecturally amazing and takes you back to the old British Colonial era. High vaulted ceilings and arches, ornate decorations and flowers everywhere and the outdoor area by the pool with the ceiling fans and the wait staff immaculately dressed. With the chaos of city Mumbai outside this hotel is truly ad oasis in the hustle and bustle. Checkin was swift and the rooms are large and beautifully appointed. Rooms are furnished in the colonial style but the rooms look brand new. What’s great is all the modern amenities are discreetly there, such as the"
"I visited this wonderful hotel twice in 2016 and on both occasions it was one of the highlights of month long holidays travelling around India. The service is perfection. Breakfast in the Sea Lounge fantastic; I especially enjoy the starched napkins. However it was on the second visit that this hotel truly impressed. I was travelling with my elderly parents and my Mother became seriously ill on route to Mumbai. The hotel doctor arranged an emergency appointment with a Consultant at Bombay Hospital, eventually resulting in admission for treatment which continued for several weeks after our return to the UK. The hotel provided a member of staff to assist through this very difficult time. The support at the hospital, at the hotel for my Father, at every step was, quite simply,"
"All staff are experts in customer service. Friendly, attentive and prompt. Room amenities- lovely. The rose foot bath left very afternoon was a nice touch.  Great pool area.  Salon- good pedicure  Great view and location "
This hotel is incomparable. It is excellent in every way. The architecture is magnificent. The staff are amazing. It is a privilege to walk around those fragrant elegant hallways. It really is a very special treat to stay at the Taj. My husband & I booked interconnecting rooms for our stay with our 2 sons aged 13 & 9. When we checked in there were no interconnecting rooms available so the lovely Saswata upgraded us to club rooms next to each other. I was concerned as I have never left my children in a hotel room alone but I was assured it was safe as only hotel residents were allowed on the floor & there was a butler right outside. My boys were excited so I persevered with a slightly anxious heart. And I'm so glad I did as this turned out to be the best hotel experience we have
"Our Accommodation was an executive Suite. Simply marvellous rooms furnished in the old style, with a few modern upgrades ( Big flat screen Tv's, Telephones Etc ) On checking in we inquired as to a sim card for a phone. We left it with the concierge and it was done when we were ready to go out. The staff in most departments have been with the Taj for years and are well schooled in the hospitality business. The Third floor housekeeping Executive, Manmeet Kaur, was exceptional talented in keeping our rooms so fresh. Do treat yourself with a stay at the Taj, you will not regret it ."
It was my 1st visit to Mumbai and so the visit was special. Taj Mahal Palace added to the experience by providing excellent hospitality. It was an excellent stay and we would really look forward to go back.
"Taj always has the best location. This one is the place to stay if in mumbai. Of course with Taj hospitality, its anyways an experience. Great rooms. Super restaurant choices. Pricy but then its Taj. Worth it. Great time. Service was just too amazing."
Very nice hotel with very high levels of service. The room rates are quite reasonable if you book ahead online.The service is quite extraordinary. There was a mix up with the contents of the minibar in our room for which we received three verbal and one written apology- all over one apple juice. The situation of the hotel is great. Take a room with a Gateway to India view if you are able. The charming Bombay museum is only two minutes away and a trip to Elephant Island is recommended. Boats leave from the side of the Gateway to India. No boats on a Monday. For the best people watching go at the weekend but go early as it is very busy. The hotel restaurants are OK but very expensive indeed. In fact since the devaluation of the pound sterling the food bill made me wince. More
"Truly outstanding hospitality Fully customer focussed, with the objective of ensuring exceptional levels of customer satisfaction. Over the years they have built on improving what was already outstanding. All kudos to them"
"Inspired by the British Documentary we stayed at the Taj overlooking the Gateway of India and just loved being in the ambience and location of this historic, inclusive, open to all hotel.  The staff go the extra mile, are professional and helpful and do everything they can. Stay, experience and enjoy!!!!!!"
"A GEM in all respects is sufficient to describe all aspects about this hotel.  The HARDWARE of this heritage property is super BUT the software, it's staff are the REAL GEMS. Kudos to the TAJ training & performance consistency.  The only small glitch was the High Tea @ the Sea Lounge ...there are NO HIGH'S in the High Tea anymore.  One of the employees we dealt with Ms Beauty @ Sea Lounge are a typical example of an excellent employee at the Taj ! Mumbai. It's this ' people software' strength of the TAJ group that sets them apart."
Our Stay at the Taj was excellent and very comfortable. The entire staff right from Concierge to the Butler Services understand the guest's needs and strive to fulfill them. food has improved dramatically and now caters to the Indian palate too. the rooms are well furnished and the housekeeping ensures all needs are met.
"I have visited the Taj many times over the years since we first spent Christmas there in 1980. I have many happy memories and it is an iconic place for which I have great affection. However this visit was extremely disappointing and I wish I hadn't gone. Rude staff, dirty cutlery in the restaurant and when I asked, whilst paying the bill for afternoon refreshments, for the WiFi code I was brusquely told WiFi was for room guests only. I fear it is becoming a plce relying on its past glory."
A incredible hotel with the most fantastic service. We travel a lot & I can honestly say that this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in.  The staff just cant do enough for you.  We stayed in the original building on the 3rd floor & our room had a terrace overlooking the pool. The room was exceptional.
"My cousins from Australia were visiting us  insisted on staying at a hotel and not with us. They wanted a luxury experience. I couldnt think of a better place than the Taj Mahal, Mumbai. They had the most wonderful stay - super luxury, pampering et all. Everything from the service to the food and overall hospitality was impeccable. They left with the most wonderful memories and  are already planning a another visit soon. Kudos to Mr Taljinder Singh, Siddhartha Natu and the team ."
"Absolutly amazing hotel. We had high expectations and yet we where amazed at the luxury and service. Concidering the extraordninary quality the rate was very resonable. Its the best value for money in any hotel Ive ever stayed in. MR Chirag, our personal concierge went above and beyond and a bit further still to ensure that every detail of our stay was execelent. Mr Dilip, our housekeeper amazed us every day with fresh flowers or chocholates or some other delightful suprise in our room. I am a frequent traveler and I can handsdown say that the Taj offers the best breakfast I have experienced anywhere in the world. A special thanks to Ms Deepshika who made sure that every day started with a smile."
"taj is better than my home-what else to say. this my 3 rd stay and taj services have always impressed me. my kids want to stay there forever, they are budding doctors. my room was facing gateway of india, great feeling, only if we had balcony it would have been better."
"Our cruise stopped in Mumbai and had to visit the Taj Mahal Palace after watching the TV series. It was around a 20 minute walk from the cruise terminal, well actually 20 minutes on way back over 90 minutes to get there as we took a wrong turning.  The hotel is stunning and could only dream of saying there for a few days, so we opted for lunch in the Sea Lounge with views across the harbour.  The family has a small lunch with my daughter opting for an Indian dish starter which she really enjoyed.  The meal for 3 was around £70.00 with drinks. If you are in Mumbai for the day spoil yourself. Ps visit the Patisserie on the way out and treat the girls to chocolates"
"Wowww! What can I say... This hotel is definitely a must for Mumbai and even it can even be the sole reason for visiting Mumbai. It is absolutely fantastic! The location is absolutely the best. All of the restaurants and food were perfect. Our room and the decoration of the shared areas (especially the pool side) were fabulous. Service, staff and welcoming couldn't be better. Housekeeping did even put a bookmark in my book during afternoon service together with other little surprises out in the room, which made us so happy! I can never ever forget my experience in Taj Mahal Palace and will always compare my upcoming stays with this experience and I'm afraid I'll never be satisfied after this comparison :) I think that I will definitely spend a few days in Mumbai without leaving"
"Our Taj Mahal Palace Hotel experience was the most pleasurable event ever !  we celebrated our 27th wedding anniversary, you made it perfect !  the Taj is a historical place with all the ambiance and decadence it deserves, our stay was perfect.  Thank You to everyone who makes this stunning building so beautiful and enjoyable,"
"A Tata hotel built at the turn of the 20th century, the Taj Mahal Palace is located on the Mumbai shoreline overlooking the Gateway to India monument built by the British.While there is a modern tower block  addition, we stayed in the original building which has been internally restyled to a very high standard. We had a room with a shore view from which we could observe the evening strollers on the promenade opposite. Superbly furnished and with every modern convenience. Four restaurants to choose from in the evenings with differing culinary styles, and buffet breakfasts with an extensive choice of European and Indian dishes. Staff were friendly and attentive, and service was exemplary. A great introduction to an attractive city which we found steeped in history and with some"
"The hotel was great, the staff were fantastic. The food was of the highest quality and taste. I was very pleased with everything that this hotel offered, and, this was an overall superior experience.  I will most definitely return to this hotel."
this was the pinnacle of hotels and stands alone way above Marina Bay Sands or any other top shelf hotel in the world easily.  All staff simply to nice and never expected this sort service at all.  Taj you are the Taj of India and rest of the world.
"A group of us had afternoon tea here. It was well worth it. The views of the bay were spectacular.  The decor and music provided for a great ambience. The tea and snacks were fantastic.  We had plenty to eat and wish we could have stayed all night.  If you have the opportunity to go it is a must, it was my favorite place in Mumbai."
"As a regular tourist to Goa, I tend to just transit through Mumbai. Was visiting India with my cousin (her first time) so we decided to splash out and stay at The Taj Palace. It was everything you imagine and then some. We booked the Palace suite rather than the tower (a modern addition). The Palace rooms come with a butler to draw your bath (there's even a menu for types of bath). Our room had a balcony overlooking the pool. The hotel evokes images of the days of Raj and 'Indian Summers'. Sumptuous breakfast buffet of Indian and European choices served by very polite waiters in elegant surroundings. Definitely worth every penny for a truly unique experience."
It is indeed A Tradition at the TAJ Hotels to enhance the Hospitality Experience which I have been enjoying over 4 decades. Thank you for keeping the Tradition....you are my second home.  Thank you for your taking utmost care to ensure that my visits and stay at the Hotel is a memorable experience.
"My wife and I stayed at the Taj for a few days during our honeymoon and could not have been happier. The service was highly personalized and responsive, the room was beautiful, and the food was delicious. Everyone was smiling and often anticipating our needs, starting with our driver pick-up at the airport through our check-out and drop-off. Thanks for a great experience!"
The Taj is an amazing hotel. My friend and I stayed 4 nights and were upgraded from a tower room to a heritage. Spotlessly clean with luxe linens and a beautiful decor. the breakfast was amazing. Excellent service also. If you don't go to the restaurants or order room service this hotel is surprisingly affordable- especially by Australian standards! Wouldn't hesitate to return. Great location.
"This by far is one of the most amazing hotels I have been too. The hotel is comprised of two parts: The Tower and the Palace. My recommendation - The palace. The design, the architecture, the atmosphere, the rooms, the many eating opportunities in the various restaurants, the service are all just superb.The outdoor swimming pool, the spa which includes one the best hotel fitness centers I have seen makes a stay in the hotel memorable. Nothing to add."
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai offers perfect service in a perfect environment! It is definitively the place to be. Every aspect of the stay has to be assessed with 100%. Cleanliness, quality of food, room layout as well as a very obliging and cordial team made my time with the hotel pleasant to the highest extent."
An amazing experience....they went out of their way to make my daughter feel special by placing flowers and balloons in her room for her 16th birthday. My daughter and I were in India as a celebration for her 16th. The staff were very attentive to this and also upgraded us.
Let's face it people come here to have their picture taken with a the hotel as a backdrop - so this is a truly iconic hotel  The food was excellent - the drinks are European prices ($6 for a beer) - and every detail is catered for.   One thought - we took the 'Cool Cabs' rather than the hotel car for the half day tour of the city and it was much more colorful and only Rp1800. Concierge was absolutely perfect - they clearly work hard on this aspect - and recommends some great places to eat
"I cannot speak highly enough of the Taj.The entire experience was utterly outstanding. The old world gracious surroundings were matched by impeccable service with old fashioned charm, absolute attention to detail, and obvious pride in the service being delivered. This was our first visit, but it will not be our last. Well done, Taj!"
"Opposite the Arabian Sea, this plush hotel is a 6-minute walk from the Gateway of India and 3.4 km from the bustling Marine Drive.  Freebies include a breakfast buffet, parking and airport pickup (for club-level and suites’ guests) . There are 11 upscale restaurants and bars. A spa, a beauty salon, an outdoor pool, a fitness room and a luxe shopping zone are also on-site."
"This hotel is amazing. The location, the architecture, the view, the décor, the food, the service are all the best you will find anywhere. There is nothing really more you can say about it. I unreservedly recommend this hotel the next time and every time you come to Mumbai."
The Taj is a Faboulous hotel. One of the best where i've been. All the staff is first class and the treatment you receive is perfect. I had booked a sea view room but they upgraded to the faboulous Neptune suite. Restaurants are very good and the breakfast is superb. The only thing i missed was an old english 5 o clock tea. If it was not so far from Europe I'ld go often there. My compliments and thanks for a wonderful stay
Practical perfect in every way - including it's amazing smell!  Loved staying here - service is exceptional and the hotel ideally situated opposite the Gateway to India. Breakfasts were extensive and amazing views whilst enjoying them.
This is an amazing hotel and probably one of the best places I have ever visited. I was in Mumbai for a few weeks and stayed here for several days.  The staff are unbelievable and hotel itself is off the charts.  It has great food and the rooms are also beautiful.  Should be on your bucket list if you are  a traveler.
We had a great time at the Taj. Excellent warm welcome and very courteous and helpful staff (especially Glen and Rajat). Beautiful view. Very tranquil and yet in the middle of happening area. I would recommend the hotel strongly to the discerning tourists.
"Jan 2017. Family of 4: 2 adults, 16yo and 10yo, executive suite, Palace Wing. Truly exceptional service with an equally exceptional personal touch. Despite this being a massive establishment every single employee seemingly makes it a point to greet you with a smile: from the security check people outside (tight security including metal detectors; not typical but understandable) to the multiple people who greet you inside and are all too wiling to help, to reception, room service, housekeeping, various restaurants, spa, pool..literally everyone is very friendly. Multiple choices when it comes to cuisine and restaurants (check their website...all accurate!). The suite itself was amazingly comfortable. Round the clock service. The whole atmosphere was very yesteryear (as we like"
We were visiting Mumbai and dinner here was one important thing on our list of musts. We booked lunch in their Masala Kraft restaurant. It was amazing. The service was exceptional and the food excellent. This hotel is a true gem in the city. Well worth a visit. 
"I stayed at this hotel on my last day in India after backpacking for 3 weeks. From the moment i stepped through the doors i was treated like royalty. The staff couldn't do enough for me, always polite and friendly.  Its such an iconic building that i could not leave Mumbai without staying here. I'm so glad i did because it makes me want to revisit Mumbai and stay here again  They treat you like royalty and i think thats so awesome  Thanks for the great experience Sharon Trafford"
Enjoy The Taj with family lovely welcome by hotel staffs great buffet breakfast and very caring staffs. Location is very good walking distance to Gateway of India and sea. Rooms are good with all modern facility.
"Originally we were in Tower, but asked to move.  There was a wet odor in the Tower room and hallway.  The Palace Wing was outstanding.  The room was beautiful and clean.  My husband felt a little ill (Delhi Belly), the hotel had a doctor that saw him right away.  He was feeling better in no time.   I highly recommend the hotel and the service was impeccable."
"Lovely historic hotel with extremely friendly and respectful staff. Rooms are little small but this is an historic hotel. Excellent dining options including Chinese, Sushi, Middle Eastern, Indian, and more!"
fantastic hotel service was incredible great location.Spa and swimming pool first class friendly super staff .This hotel must be once of the best in the world.Our days started with a great breakfast in the Ocean room with great views over the harbour what a way to start the day.
"This was one of the oldest hotels of Mumbai and practically all dignitaries visiting Mumbai stay here. Its got everything from fine dining to luxury shopping (slightly limited). If you are staying here its one of the best locations. If not drop in for a meal and enjoy one of the many themed restaurants from Indian to Japanese to Chinese. Its a 5 star and a luxury collection, so expect prices to be that way."
"Goes without saying that this hotel has the most amazing view in Mumbai and is probably also the most luxurious! So, we were of course quite happy with our rooms and the view.   However, because of where this hotel is located, it is a very busy hotel. The staff is more snooty than other Taj properties and someone actually told us that they don't let anyone touch the piano because the hotel is like a ""dharamshala"" with too many people coming in and going out all the time!   Also, the day we stayed, Navy Day was being celebrated so we got to see some amazing performances from our room at the Gateway, but the parking was closed so we had to park a km away and it was quite inconvenient."
"I have been lucky enough to visit many luxury hotels in my time so didn't expect to be as blown away as I was by this hotel! Genuinely outstanding in every way. Service, food, the rooms, the attention to detail were all second to none.  If you want a really special experience, this is the hotel for you. The attention to detail is incredible, right down to the petals and bath bubbles, fruit and drinks in the room and traditional welcome.  Genuinely faultless. Many many supposed 5 star hotels could learn a lot from the team here.  "
"Lovely room in beautiful charming hotel. Club room included breakfast, high tea, cocktails and after dinner chocolates and brandy. A luxurious experience. Lots of atmosphere, invoking times gone by. Probably very best place to stay in Mumbai."
"Words are not enough to describe the experience of The Taj Mahal Palace. From checking in to checking out, you are being taken care completely.   They have total 11 in hotel dining options, so you can guess the greatness!  The view from sea lounge is to die for.  They offer complementary tea and juices throughout the day which is worth mentioning.  Trust me guys it's an experience to go out for!"
We had a wonderful stay at this hotel - the staff went out of their way to ensure every little detail was to our satisfaction and we will strongly recommend this hotel as the place to stay when visiting Mumbai.
"this hotel is by far the best option in mumbai, if you look for a hotel with character and class.   location is obviously not at all convenient if you need to be in the suburbs / close to airport, but apart from that - great!  i have visited this hotel many times over the years, in fact our family average at least 4-5 visits per year at this hotel when taking short breaks, and service is consistent and its very predictable having a good experience in this hotel..."
"The staff was very nice and hotel is amazing. Really good food, specially when you are bored of indian food. The Sea Lounge in the afternoon with the piano is a must that you cannot forget. The garden is like a paradise in the middle of the caos. I reallly recommend this hotel to everyone, couples, families, friends..."
"Excellent location, excellent service, hospitality, Spa, Fitness Centre, Gym, Restaurant etc. A wonderful stay experience. The old heritage wing is very beautiful with historical background. The video displayed on the TV which explains about the history of Taj Mahal Hotel is really a wonderful collection of views expressed by various prominent people."
"This hotel is an Icon in mumbai and many tourist visit Mumbai to see this hotel. Hotel offers beautiful views of the Gateway of India and the sea. It is close to Colaba where you can find many places for dining, parties and shopping."
"We stayed at the Taj, in the Palace wing of the hotel. The art and décor was impressive but we do not understand on what basis this place is considered a 5 star hotel.   Whilst the location might be considered good for some, we thought the two-hour drive from the airport to the hotel was a ludicrous amount of time to spend in traffic after a long-haul flight. We all know just how bad Mumbai traffic can be, but it is a deal-breaker to stay here again.   If the two-hour drive to the hotel wasn’t bad enough, when we arrived, we had a delayed check-in. Young ladies are waiting eagerly to introduce new guests to the hotel by placing garlands around our necks and a dot on the forehead. However, once they do this, they disappear and you have to hope that they will see you after they"
"Stayed in Mumbai earlier also. But, the warmth and hospitality offered here was beyond any other hotel. Specially the breakfast at Shamiana was amazing as the services was so quick being over booked. Enjoyed a lot..."
"Location, location, location. The key factor to any property, and the TAJ delivers in every respect. From checkin to checkout you can expect only the best from the TAJ Mumbai and they deliver in fine fashion. The Gateway to India is a stone throw away and local restaurants and shopping within walking distance, making the TAJ a must on your India travels."
"A lovely place to stay, helpfull attentive staff, clean, comfortable, over priced bar and catering - but you can of course eat and drink elsewhere! A fantastic location, in the most 'touristy' side of the city, if your lucky some wonderful seaward views from rooms. Considering the awesome crowds around the 'Gate' it is quiet and peacefull. Good breakfast, but if you havn't got an ""all inclusive"" booking it is exhorbitantly priced. As a 'once in a lifetime' experience it MAY be worth the cost to stay here, but I have to say Raffles in Singapore has the edge on it for history and colonial quirkyness. But in seriousness I can't criticise the place in any way,"
"The iconic Taj Mahal Palace delivers on every level and provides a calm setting in bustling Mumbai. The Palace wing is spectacular with lovely, well maintained rooms and bathrooms and, in many cases, great views. Garden, Pool and terrace are lovely as is the spa. Food and service are excellent and the concierge desk is extremely helpful, friendly and well organized."
"A splendid hotel right by the gateway to India . This gateway is a busting hub of activity and pigeons!! Excellent hospitality by every staff....food awesome...housekeeping always at beck n call....butler at hand 7* experience.Situated at the Gateway TO India in the heart of the city our room offered a great view of the Arabian sea.  Stayed January 2017, with friends and had great time"
Every thing about the place is excellent.We were here for our anniversary.They made our day special by decorating the room.sending cake. The view from skylounge is also very good.You should try and take the sea side tables .
This was by far the best hotel in India I've ever been to. The hotel was absolutely beautiful and worthy of the 5 star title. The service was absolutely excellent with housekeeping going above and beyond during my stay. The restaurants served absolutely delicious food. The staff were so friendly and attentive. We met the chef at one of the restaurants who thanked us for consistenly coming for 3 days! It was a truly wondrous stay and I would return in a heartbeat.
"Anyone contemplating visiting India MUST start their visit at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai. We have just had a wonderful experience there at Christmas. Everything about the Hotel was extraordinary, including the Staff who are so obliging and courteous. Cannot recommend this Hotel too highly."
"Our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace has been outstanding and the Hotel has gone out of its way to express its commitment to providing the best service to ourselves and all its guests. The hotel is very well located, and the service quality was amazing.The room we've got was very nice, with a wonderful view on the india gate (Thanks Harsh!)  We would like to thank our butler Rahul for his exceptional service, his attention to details, and the way he helped us to get a nice table at the restaurant. Also we would like to thank Adrian for the follow up... We had the chance to visit Mumbai with Pravin, who provided a perfect service and shared his good knowledge of the city. We cannot express enough thanks to the staff for their desire to delight us, because they have exceeded all our"
"Of all my hotels stays, this exceeded all my expectations of cleanliness, hospitality and attention to detail.  Everyone is so genuine and caring.  The cleanliness, thoughtful wrapping of phone cords, flower petals laid in design to welcome us back, complimentary high tea, souvenir good bye ritual and on and on.  The breakfast was impecable, service was beyond timely and graceful, the food was delicious."
"Not only met, but overly exceeded my expectations! I stayed here on the last night of an intensive, exhaustive three-week tour of India. The Taj Palace was a welcome goodbye to my time in india. The level of service, and attention to the smallest detail were amazing!"
"Was waiting in the lobby for our dinner at Souk. A cleaner staff was nearby. Gently asked him a glass of water. He flatly refused, saying, I need to go to Shamiana to have the same...and went off. Roadside food joints behalves better. Hell with their Gold card that I hold...and they r known 4 services???"
"The Taj Mahal Palace hosted my family for a night on our way back home. From the moment you are picked up at the airport to the point at which you leave the customer service is outstanding. The hotel itself is an icon. You could spend a day just wondering around the grand interior looking at the art and architecture. That said, there is also a selection of bars and restaurants to catch the eye, a tropical outdoor pool (there is always something nice about being able to hear the bustle of a city whilst relaxing by the pool) and a small spa tucked in by poolside. We did not find a run of the mill hotel dossier in our room which details where everything is. Perhaps this is the norm for such a great hotel, and we quickly found out that all the staff had all the answers. It was just"
"Fantastic hotel which was the perfect finish to our 3 week honeymoon, if you want attention to detail and the best service in the world then the Taj Mahal is the place to stay.  Every detail is attended to, I recommend either a suite or the Taj club room as the additional features are well worth the extra costs.  Food and drinks are as per the hotel expensive but don't be fooled the quality is exceptional so value for money again if you're happy to pay for the finer things in life!   top and tail your trip with airport pick up and drop off arranged through the hotel and leave with a great memory."
"Since we did no carry the US passports while registering. The Taj Mahal management team gave us a driver and a car to go and pick up our passports from our home. Additionally, they provided a cake to celebrate our 36th marriage anniversary. Took care of our needs very well.  Thank you."
"Great property,nice rooms,very courteous staff,upgarded on arrival.Only bad experience was the delay of almost 30mins for bags to arrive with 1 missing bag which was delivered later. Restaurant not big enough for hotel guests and had to wait 20mins for breakfast as there were no tables available…..not a big issue but can be a bit stressful if you have a flight to catch in Mumbai's traffic."
"absolutely fantastic .. this has to rate as one of the best hotels in the world .. certainly comparing it to all the other places we have stayed in .. right from the start to the check out , everything was perfect."
"Just another fabulous stay in a superb, modern but traditionally colonial, excellently managed hotel. We always make a bee line for the Taj Palace in Mumbai  and are never ever disappointed. Thank you to everyone within this iconic building."
"We spent  December 31st, our last day of a three week trip around India at the Taj. We had booked our room, a Luxury Grande Sea View months ahead of the trip and were very much looking forward to The View which most guests want to have when staying in this hotel. So it was with amusement that upon check in ( a quite long process at the Taj unfortunately) we listened to the employee try to bribe us with complimentary High Tea and complimentary cocktails if we were to ""upgrade"" to a pool facing suite. He was quite baffled when we turned down his generous offer! But good try, we thought! Our sea facing view was beautiful and spacious . High tea ( not free since we were not staying in a suite, lol) at the Sea Lounge was absolutely delicious and the staff were wonderful. The hotel is"
"We have spent 4 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace from Dec 28th to Jan 1st, in a Palace wing room on the Club floors.   The entire overall experience of staying at this hotel is extraordinary and above all expectations. Having stayed at other 5 star facilities in India, it was the only time when it felt that everyone was taking care of you without being intrusive.   The major pluses of the hotel would be :  + rooms that have maintained their heritage luxury feel while at the same time having all modern facilities + Palace services and the day/night butlers   - > I think these people do not have the word no in their vocabulary + Basically all staff that you get in contact with  + We had the chance to get Sunday brunh on January 1st, on the Chambers lawns - turned out to be the best"
We had a wonderful stay here! The breakfast at the Shamiana is amazing! So much to choose from !The all day menu is very good. High tea at the Sea lounge was excellent . We ate at the Golden Dragon and at Masala Craft -both dinners was greet and the service is above and beyond! The staff is friendly smiling helpful professional!! We enjoyed the swimming pool it's like a paradise!  
"The initial reception was so welcoming and relaxing after a couple of long flights - and arriving in the middle of the night. We found over the four days staying there that the staff were excellent, remembering our preferences and being very attentive. The room and amenities were excellent. They were also very helpful with the currency issue that we faced with the demonetization. There was no request, need or recommendation that they did not immediately help with, and helped make our stay in Mumbai a wonderful experience."
"A truly world class outfit - exceeded all my expectations!! From arrival to departure the service was excellent, the food in all of the hotel restaurants was fabulous and authentic in taste. We travelled with three children & were looked after all the way through, the kids loved the pool as it was clean & easy to use."
"I went to the Taj for high tea with friends of mine and were delighted by all their delicatessen. Food was top quality, with lots of different snacks and dishes to choose from!! Service was great as well and highly responsive with the orders. It was a great experience at an incredible price so when you're in Mumbai next, go to the Taj and enjoy your high-tea while the sun sets :)"
"Excellent, Courteous Service. Always trying to please. Feel like a king at the Hotel. Like the Private feeling while dinning at the Poolside. 7 stars in every way.  Definitely will recommend and be back like every year."
"Arrived at the Taj on 31st December and of course the hotel and the surrounds were very busy with an expectant New Years Eve crowd.  Used the hotel airport transfer service which was excellent and many thanks to Ricky the chauffeur who was informative and interesting and made the speedy (think we got lucky ) 45 minute transfer from the airport very special.  As it was so busy we experienced a slight delay at check in to the Palace which meant we received an upgrade to the club lounge for evening drinks and nibbles.  Unfortunately when we first used the lounge they attempted to charge us for usage as our room number would not normally attract the evening activities.  It was all sorted out very apologetically.  The room was very good, however, as it was a garden facing room, the"
"This hotel is astounding. Each time I stay there are little things that they have added to the overall experience that just makes it so easy to love this hotel.  For example, the room cleaners noticed that I wear glasses so left a glasses cleaner in the room.  They also saw I was running out of toothpaste, so left a new one for me.  Lots more little things that are so personal and make all the difference.  The breakfast is amazing and even that have been improved.  Overall, I can not fault this beautiful hotel."
"If you can stay here, you must absolutely!!! I feel like a Maharani, a princess.  From the ease of check in, the ceremony of getting a string of tulsi around your neck and a chandlo on your forehead, and the pomp and circumstance. We had our very own butler, Manoj. Our rooms were beautiful, in the Palace, with a small view of the Gateway. The rooms are updated and a good size. We stayed on the 6th floor just down a few doors from the Presidential suite. It's everything I could ever have dreamed of. Everything. The service is outstanding. By far the best we have ever had.  Please please stay here if you can. You will not regret it. It will be something you remember forever.  "
"Historic, brilliantly run matron of a hotel. A gem. Extraordinary staff. Flawless service on the butler floor. Very good restaurants. Spectacular views.  Great tea service. Wonderful people watching in the lobby. Great hotel shops. Go there!"
"I booked well in advance on the hotel's website and got a terrific deal for two rooms in the palace wing.  From beginning to end, the service at this Mumbai oasis was impeccable.  The rooms and the common spaces were gorgeous, and the food was pretty darn good.  We skipped dinner our second night and opted for the tea buffet which featured nicely prepared versions of Indian street food.  The only drawback was that there seemed to be a lot of activity in the hallways at night."
Firstly the staff at the Taj are tremendous. They were always helpful and friendly. We were here for three nights just before New Year and the hotel was rammed full. The staff were run ragged especially in the club lounge in the evenings and on the topic of the club lounge as the hotel was full it was far too small. If you didn't arrive early there was no chance of getting a seat. You also had groups of people rearranging the furniture because they wanted to sit together and this caused problems for everyone. At some point you have to say no! The waiting staff did the best they could but management was severely lacking in not providing more staff at a very busy time.  As it was so busy so was the pool area which has very limited space and loungers available. If you were not at
"This magnificent iconic hotel has spectacular service. I had left my phone on the plane and they manage to get it from the  airport within a few hours. We were not pleased with our room and they changed it. We stayed in the tower which was pretty standard but gracious. Would have loved to stay in the palace. The food was excellent, extensive buffet breakfast and some of the restaurants that we tried.  the pool was magnificent and the tour of the hotel was fascinating. The spa was relaxing and wonderful. They left us a foot massage set up,with rose petals In our room each night. It is a very busy happening place so there is always a bustle in the lobby. Much like the rest of the city."
"- Architecture and decor: the hotel is an impressive building very well located in a bustling part of Mumbai. I stayed in room 526 in the palace section. The room was well appointed and it overlooked the pool area. It lacked in natural lighting and while perfectly nice, it wasn't anything special. The hallways are really nice but sound travels and a lot of the hustle and bustle from outside the room could be heard inside.  - Service: this is where the hotel receives, in my opinion, the highest possible rating. Everyone went out of their way to help, was friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  - Breakfast in the Palace Room: nice spread and in my case included in the room rate. Service again top notch but some of the cooking stations (eggs in particular) were really slow. I"
"When you enter the hotel everything changes. There is a striking contrast between the hotel and the streets. A building full of history, very well decorated, different restaurants, expensive shops. The only problem is; it is too crowded. If you want to relax and have a quiet time this is not the place except the pool side. The amenities of the rooms are moderate. The location is perfect, just across the Gateway to India and easy access to the boats going to elephant island."
" good responsibilty,excellent and tasty food,good helpers,etc.. i like it in that hotel,good bedrooms in the hotel .i like to go trip to hotel.it is good to see from  outside it looks good . we all went to that hotel"
"It would be hard to fault this place. Great location, stunning history and building. Upon arrival, an attendant seats you in the central lounge and walks you gently through the check in process. We only had a night there and asked to extend a second night, which was no problem. They walked us to our room and explained everything we needed, also bringing some welcome drinks of fruit juice.   The room appointment was royal, but perhaps a little dated. The bathroom was immaculate. We had a great view out of the bay.   Breakfast is not to be missed in the Sea Lounge. The buffet whilst on the slightly expensive side for fairly normal quality, was unforgettable due to the rising sun over the Arabian sea, beside the Gateway to India.   There wasn't anything that the staff weren't"
"We decided to spend Christmas at The Taj as we wanted to make our stay away from home extra special seeing as we were going to miss our annual family get together.  The driver who collected us from JW Marriott in Juhu was courteous and very professional. Our welcome at the hotel was OK.  The property is absolutely beautiful and the aroma of jasmine gives the place and exotic feel. Our suite was to die for (room 546/Neptune Suite). The decor is gorgeous with a super king size bed, a beautiful lounge in which some lovely goodies were left for us to enjoy. The dining area is even more beautiful. The bathroom has a lovely marble bath. The suite has a Sea view and the Gate of India is also visible.  Housekeeping did a wonderful job of ensuring we had fresh flowers in the room and on"
"What to say... a once-in-a-lifetime experience... It's pricy but definitely worth it... The hotel restaurants are excellent (we had high tea at the Sea Lounge and dinner at the Masala Kraft), but the hotel itself is just outstanding - architecture and service-wise, without even mentioning the historic dymension."
"Although we didn't stay at the Hotel, it is well worth a visit to marvel at the splendor of old.  The architecture is beautiful, interesting to view the portraits and marvel at the building.  Security is intense, screening of all vehicles and all people pass through metal detecters and all things carried go through screeners.  So very lovely inside, well worth the added security to view."
"Great hotel, lovely food, great location and loads of history and tradition. The facilities - gym, pool etc - are also really good and the range of restaurants is brilliant.  The only thing that let it down a bit was the service, particular in the Palace Lounge for afternoon tea and then pre-dinner cocktails. Very slow and inattentive staff that took a good 15 minutes to bring a round of drinks."
"Even though we only had time for an overnight stay, it was well worth it for us.  The hotel accommodated our family members coming in from South Africa and the US, and what was especially pleasing was the room upgrade, so we could all stay together.  From pickup at the Mumbai Int'l Airport to suggestions for dinner, overall a quality experience  - and to be repeated."
We stayed at the hotel from Dec 28th to 30th. The service was second to none and the rooms spotless. The whole place has a 5 star feel and the staff could not be more attentive. Well worth the money.  The pool area is a pleasant break from the Hustle and bustle of Mumbai. The Gateway of India was outside our bedroom window which made our visit even more special.  
"We had the pleasure of spending a long holiday weekend at the Taj Mahal Palace.  Everything was perfect.  We were greeted warmly upon arrival, escorted to check-in, and even given an upgrade into the Palace section of the hotel.  The hotel has a rich and interesting history and is well located in Colaba. Breakfast, lunch by the pool, and sundowners were all equally delicious with impeccable service.We will definitely return--hopefully sooner rather than later!"
"My recent experience at the beautiful Taj Hotel in October 2016 came just after a strenuous three-week yoga teacher training retreat in Rishikesh.  I wanted a place where I could ease back in to the more frenetic pace of the world outside the ashram.  The Taj was perfect: well located, exquisitely decorated, steeped in history, and with an unequaled staff who provide great attention to the guests’ comfort.  Attention to every detail in presentation of the guest rooms and throughout common areas of the hotel create a relaxing, safe, and peaceful atmosphere, all very important for a woman traveling alone for the first time to Mumbai.    I’ve stayed in many lovely hotels around the world.  Having a beautiful property does not guarantee a relaxing stay; there are any number of"
The Taj Mahal Palace is  remittent of a graceful age of classic hotels that are hard to find today . My son kept saying it reminds him of the movie Grand Budapest Hotel. A very elegant and graceful hotel with style and class. Both the eternal and internal ambiance is super beautiful. The check in fast and efficient. The concierge on top of their game and the staff very well trained and they have a great way of doing things. So well trained are the staff that even when one was on her mobile she set in aside and greeted us without having any reservations. All the staff are friendly helpful. My advice is spend the extra to money and stay in the original hotel it has its perks. Not only have the rooms been renovated although small in size they have the latest technology and are well
"Because the Taj Palace is a famous hotel in Mumbai it was a must stay really. Had a nice spacious room in the Heritage part of the hotel with a great view of the sea and the Gate of Mumbai. The hotel is lovely inside, and to see the architecture and history was interesting.  The pool is very nice and a great place to cool down and relax after sightseeing around the city  Good to stay here for the experience."
"As we stayed in this hotel before, we wanted to have lunch in the Sealounge while we were passing by on a trip. The view at the windowseats is always spectacular. On top of that, the food and service is very acceptable for a light bite."
"The service is immaculate . ALL of the staff polite and efficient . The pool stunning . The food amazing . Reasonable prices for 5 star luxury. Only downside is the horns during the day from the rod nearby , but this is India !"
We stayed in the heritage wing of the Taj Palace Hotel in December. This place has  a history and nostalgia. The reception staff are competent and prior to my arrival I received a message from the Hotel regarding car parking woes due to celebration of Navy Day and closure of the approach road . So we took precautions. The check in was smooth. The room was spacious and well maintained and has retained its vintage character. The bed was nice and room clean. Although the bathroom/toilet was good and spacious my only grudge was that it was not groomed for Indian hygiene needs as jetspray was missing. ( Interestingly when they give you heritage tour of the hotel they tell you that this hotel was made by Tata primarily to serve Indians as protest against English chauvinism ! Nowadays
"Everything you expect to be brilliant about this flagship hotel is! My husband experienced a minor health issue which required medical attention. Nothing was too much trouble including the in-house doctor and the subsequent collection of medication. Now, this was good, but it was the personal attention that supported his few days in bed recovery; the hot toddies, the inhalation and suggestions for special diet. People checking on his wellbeing once he was up and about was also an unexpected touch, an intimacy and care not experienced before in our travels."
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in Colaba, Mumbai for 4 days just before Christmas '16 and loved almost every minute of it. While we originally wanted to stay in the iconic old building, we were quite delighted by our room on the 6th floor in the new building, with a direct view of the Gateway of India (across the street), and the sea beyond it.   The room was surprisingly affordable, working out to about $200 per night. Considering that this included wifi and a spectacular and abundant breakfast, we thought it was an excellent deal. The service was courteous and attentive. The sumptuous luxury of the lobbies and public spaces, and the especial elegance of the old building made the stay memorable. (All guests are able to have their breakfasts in either building, and hang out"
"The Taj hotel is a very nice hotel with very nice rooms and service. Nobody can deny that for sure. However, I felt a bit disappointed because i thought it has lost its Indian cachet. From the outside, the hotel is breathtaking (architectural wise) but once you enter it looks like any western hotel anywhere in the world. The decoration in the rooms is very neutral. There is not a single decoration element that reminds you that you are in India. For a palace that beautiful I regret that it hasn't kept its SPIRIT despite it's a historic character. Otherwise, the service is wonderful and we really enjoyed our stay but the ""hotel experience"" can be improved. "
"Excellent service which was attentive but not intrusive. We stayed in the Palace building itself so cannot comment on the Tower but the rooms were excellent, spacious, well equipped and maintained to a very high standard. A lot of the rooms do not face out to the sea but even if it costs a bit more we would recommend booking a sea view room. The only element that was possibly slightly below par was the quality of food and service in the cafe and pool area. That said, we would highly recommend the hotel as a base from which to explore Mumbai."
"We spent hours trying to book from the UK . The reservations team are inefficient and ineffectual.On arrival, nothing seemed to have been booked or details retained. We queued for breakfast, queued for evening cocktails, the hotel has the feel of a pricey holiday camp. We could not have been made to feel less special. It was the final leg of our 2 week trip - and the Taj was our worst stay by quite a margin. The Duty Manager called our room at 10.30pm to tell us that we had exceeded our credit card deposit limit, and that we needed to pay for the remaining bill - even though  we were nowhere close to exceeding our credit limit and they had the credit card details in any event. The sole exception to this catalogue of ineptitude and disappointment was the restaurant manager of the"
"The hotel and its staff are the best we have ever encountered. The location is perfect - we had a room overlooking the Gateway to India and the harbour. The hotel itself is grand, beautiful and interesting (there is even a daily tour so you can appreciate it more fully). At all times the staff were friendly and helpful, striving to delight (and succeeding). It was an unforgettable start to our honeymoon."
"To sample India during Colonial times this hotel is worth the experience. The Mumbai bombing in 2012 by Muslim terrorists has increased security which takes the pleasure a notch down.  Service is a whole level ++. Our room was so neat each time we returned and same floor attendant greeted us.  The Guided Tour of Taj Palace is worth taking. The Five a la carte restaurants... The Souk, The Golden Dragon, The Sea breeze lounge, The Masala Kraft and Taj Restaurant are rated in the top 50 of the 14,000 on Mumbai TripAdvisor. That should tell you something. "
I stayed at this hotel in 2003 and have visited it myriad times since then. It is a real gem. The interiors are beautiful. The staff is warm. It's just a treat to walk around. I stayed in a luxurious club room and found it a treat. 
Taj is Taj . No need to say anything about this hotel everything is so perfect always. However we wAnted to have coffee by the poolside but we're not allowed as it is for residents only. Ultimately we had to go to Star Bucks for the coffee .
"We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights on a short trip to Mumbai. From the moment we stepped in we were treated like royalty. The decor is breathtaking we checked in and received an upgrade. We were welcomed traditionally.  We were taken up the room and it room was perfect with a view of the Gateway of India. The room itself was spacious a real vintage feel. The bathroom was huge, the bed was so comfortable. The staff at the Taj should be given credit from the staff at security, to reception, room service the butler everyone always has a smile on their face and nothing is too much for them. Genuinely happy staff who made the stay so much more enjoyable and pleasant.   Even though the hotel itself is very big we didn't feel it was over crowded at all. We had breakfast at the Sea"
"A good opportunity to visit the Taj Mahal Hotel Apollo Bunder came my way when I went to witness the national finals of the Tata Crucible Quiz. While the event hosted in the historic ball room of the hotel was great, I found the hotel to be even more amazing. The buffet dinner served there had a touch of class, very good taste and variety. It made me realise that food is one reason why Taj Hotels are the best in business. But more than the food what was awesome was the rich historical importance this particular Taj Hotel has. It was the first building in Mumbai to be lit up by electricity. The last meeting held by Lord Mountbatten was held in the ballroom of this very hotel. The passage ways near the ballroom had pictures of the famous guests visiting the hotel which was great"
"What a treat to arrive at the Taj after a long drive (and heavy traffic) through the bustling city. Check-in was smooth and easy and the staff was above reproach. Side note ... we had just left the Taj property in Bekal having spent 3 nights in a room that absolutely reeked of sewer water. That said, we were over the moon to be shown into our room in the palace wing, overlooking the Gateway to India - and with Butler service to boot! A stay at this crown jewel is a must for all!! Do not hesitate. "
"Unbelievable service. From the greeting, to front desk, to housekeeping and concierge, all made us feel like we were their number one priority. Restaurants were excellent. Wasabi delivered top quality sushi and entrees. But even casual dining sitting out by the pool was special. The gym was well designed and had the right combination of machines. The pool proved a great respite from the hurly-burly of Mumbai. Marble bath design and spacious rooms were perhaps more expensive than some hotels, but the cost was not outrageous at all compared to my experience top hotels in London, Laguna Nigel, Paris, and Tokyo. This was a total success of a stay. "
Historic building a great heritage of India Taj provides most modern hosspitality in a building that dates back to Queen's era..Stay food amenities reception all speak of the era of the Kings and Queens. You are made to feel the most important guest for the hotel.
A 113 years old Hotel spectacular maintenance and service attitude . Very pleasant stay and I highly recommend  . As an icon in Mumbai city ! over looking Arabian Sea a treat . Breakfast was excellent so was the room and stay
"Perfection is standard...luxury at its best glowing_starglowing_starglowing_starglowing_starglowing_starglowing_star Attentive staff, wonderful 33 metre long swimming pool, great india's lobsters from the  barbecue ( thank you so much to the Chef who went into the trouble to serve me a lobster in the morning, right before I left the hotel although the serving time is 6 till 11 pm at the poolside: I highly appreciate )  A nice (little as in a minimum of machines )  gym with professional smiling and friendly  staff Efficient concierge to whom I had asked to send a registered letter and called to let me know that it have been done.....20 minutes later Oh....one con though.... I wasn't able to visit Mumbai as I refused to leave the premises during my whole stay....enjoyed the place too much ( Mumbai's sightseeing from my cab's window) cat_with_tears_of_joycat_with_tears_of_joycat_with_tears_of_joy"
"from the moment we arrived until we left we were treated like royalty, nothing is too much trouble, all the staff were attentive, friendly, professional and approachable, we would highly recommend staying at least one night. we chose the upgrade package which was very good value for money! Although this hotel caters for the rich and famous, anyone who stays here is treated equally so for the average couple, it is a great glimpse into how the other half live!!!"
Any amount of appreciation for this hotel and its staff is not enough. Everything right from the location to the facilities at the hotel and the staff are top of the line. The minutest details are taken care - esp as we were travelling with 2 small children. No complaints
"This exotic beauty is a treat for eyes. The ambience and service is no less than any Royalty. The food at taj shamiana is quite budget friendly, you will get from pizza, biryani to mumbai pav bhaji. Once in a life a must must go."
"This was a long-awaited return to the Taj and we were not disappointed. Great staff, room and facilities, simply what is appropriate for one of the leading hotels in the world. Having arrived early, we were served tea and coffee for a short period, until our room was made available to us, and this was well before the advertised time!"
"We are just leaving having spent Christmas relaxing in the hotel and sightseeing in and around Mumbai.  It was an homage for me, having stayed almost twenty years ago on business and having vowed to bring my partner one day.  The restored palace wing is a treat, the club room afforded us a sea view, breakfast in the Sea Lounge and snacks and cocktails in the Palace Lounge.  The service from the staff was perfect in every restaurant, at the pool, from the attentive butlers (Rahul and Adrian who sorted everything for us), in the room and at reception.  The concierge bought us tickets to see the latest Bollywood hit Dangal at the local Regal Cinema, Anand took us on a great city tour.  We are in India to enjoy local veg food so ate at the Sea Lounge (prepare for long queues at"
"I love this hotel, I stay in Palace wing for 15 nights. Over all quality is very luxurious. My over all rating for this hotel is excellent, Only the problems with hotel is hotel security. The incident happens with one of my colleague, that hotel staff stop him on staircase because he was not looking handsome and asked him to show identity. when he show room key then hotel security allow him to go. But at the same time one foreigner  went before him and hotel security did not checked him. my question is if hotel security believe on people by face and cloths. then we are same that we are Indian."
"One of the best experiences we've ever had at a hotel.  Rooms are spectacular, high ceilings, everything is perfect.  What makes the Taj better than the rest of the great hotels is their service.  They ran out of chocolate croissants at breakfast and they then fresh baked more for my son.  That was a standard breakfast experience.  The breakfast buffet was expansive and delicious.  I didn't expect the pool to be so nice- it being the middle of Mumbai- but it was great. We left some kid sandles there and they proactively contacted me after we checked out. I cannot say enough good things about the Taj.  A great oasis in the middle of a very crazy city, with tons of history and culture. Will go out of my way to stay here on future trips. "
It was a business meet at a historic venue which requires no certification for hospitality and our reviews. The venue and other business needs were well organised along with snacks and dinner. The taste had a sophisticated touch.   Great experience of its scenic interior and a glory.
"What a magnificent property. We spent Christmas here and found the accommodations and the service to be beyond reproach. Definitely request a room in the newer wing overlooking the pool as they are nicer with full carerra marble baths. Stroll the shops, visit one of the many restaurants or sit by the enormous pool - you could spend days inside the huge property and not see all of it. Truly a landmark- and adjacent to the Gate for good measure. "
We really enjoyed our stay at Taj! Got a room upgrade in the palace with a view of the Gateway of India. Overall service was excellent. Hotel is so awesome and luxurious...breakfast is great...we will definitely come back!
"I was on a business in Mumbai, and my wife was with my for sightseeing. It has been by second trip to Mumbai and I decided to stay in the historical Taj Mahal Palace hotel (palace wing), although it was not cheap. The hotel is truly remarkable. The serivce is absolutely fantastic. To rooms are quite old (although well updated), so one has to be prepared. Overall impression is excellent and the stay is memorable."
"We booked the hotel for our first night after the wedding! The hotel did a great job, upgraded our room and also decorated it and provided a complimentary cake. My wife was super impressed, as was I.  However, we didn't wake up in time for breakfast, which was the only downside in an otherwise awesome stay!"
"Nice n decent place. Absolute wonderful experience. Taj Hospitality you won't find anywhere. Sidhartha, Madonna made us feel great, treated us like they know us before. Definitely if I come back to Mumbai I will be staying in Taj Mahal Palace"
"The staff in all outlets be it room service, housekkeping, reception, coffee shop are extremely courteous and helpful. One feels well looked after and satisfied with the service. Will not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone who wants sheer excellence in service and hospitality."
"I finally managed to stay in this prestigious hotel in Mumbai and not sure where to begin .... it just a dream to say the least. I think, once you stay here you will like to come back here again and again (of course if you can afford ;-)). I think the staff in taj just makes your experience unforgettable to want to thank them. The pool site is just wonderful though you might hear some traffic noise but you can ignore that and enjoy it. If you are in Mumbai and if you can afford then it's a must play to stay."
"I have been wanting to stay at this hotel for many years now but have never had any reason to go to Mumbai. But this month work brought me to Mumbai. I arrived a few days before my meetings with some colleagues because we all wanted to stay here and explore a bit of Mumbai and WOW!  As soon as you approach the entrance of the hotel you are literally at the doorstep of the Gateway of India. You enter the hotel after you walk through the security scanner (bags go through a scanner too – seems to be the case in every hotel in Mumbai) and you are immediately in awe of the grandeur of the lobby. All staff members have a traditional attire uniform and I personally thought they all looked fab! The service was impeccable, the staff members always went over and beyond. I am British born"
"Excellent location right next to gateway of India, about 90 mins from international airport. Hotel is a landmark in Mumbai and world renowned for its great service and friendly staff, all that is true and more.  Hotel room initially looked very clean but one night found a cockroach in the bathroom which I quickly caught and flushed down the toilet, hotel staff came and apologized and did a cleaning of the room quickly which was appreciated.  Hotel buffet breakfast was good but I have had better. One bad policy the hotel has is they do not allow outside food in your room and thus force you to pay high hotel food prices, there are many good restaurants and places to eat outside that are world famous and at about a third of the prices the hotel charge. I saw some guest take in"
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is a must stay if you are visiting Mumbai. It is located adjacent to the India Gate Memorial with views over the harbour. Be sure to book in advance to ensure a sea view room. The early morning sunrise over the harbour is beautiful. The hotel is centrally located for sightseeing and about 15minutes taxi drive from the cricket stadium. The International airport is one hour drive but if the traffic is bad it can take one and half hours. The rooms and public areas are beautifully appointed, but for the genuine Taj Hotel experience choose a room in the original part of the hotel rather that the later built tower extension. Levels of service are of a high standard, but do not quite match the service that you will find in other Taj, Oberoi and Leela Palace"
"Absolute wonderful experience. Taj Hospitality you won't find anywhere. Sidhartha, Madonna made us feel great, treated us like they know us before. Definitely if I come back to Mumbai I will be staying in Taj Mahal Palace."
"What can I say ? My first stay at the Taj was in 2000, I must have stayed 20 or 30 times since then although my work ket me away for the past few years. This was both my first return for several years and our first visit as a family, and your staff made this a unique experience. Not only were we, the parents, amazed at the quality of the service (and of the property, but this goes without saying), but our children will, no doubt, be talking about this experience for years to come. I have personally always considered the Taj Palace as the best hotel in the world, now my children are also convinced ! Thank you to all of the wonderful people at the Taj who have made this stay an unforgettable experience !"
Great 5 stars. All staff friendly and helpful. Concierge were  amazing. Tried most the restaurants and loved them all.  Right outside the main tourist attractions and if u walk about 1 mile up the road u can past through an amazing original Indian market with all the great smells.  So want to come back again. 
"My trip is always made special with the upgrade to the lounge by Karishma , I felt so comfortable because of her presence and caring for me specially! All the members are also good ! But I started coming more often due to the special arrangements made bye her for me Thanks"
This is an Iconic Hotel and it was a pleasure to be able to stay. The hotel staff were outstanding and could not do enough for you. The Hotel has style and grandeur and elegance to match. The food was first class in the three Restaurants I used. I look forward to making a return trip the next time England play India in Mumbai.

"Hotel was superb/luxurious.  However it is the staff that make the stay & everyone that I came in touch were truly exceptional, treating you as an individual rather than just a customer.  Individual touches as having your name remembered by the girl as you went in to breakfast & having the same person serve/interact with you every night as you sat in the pool bar/lounge area, really made my overall stay truly 1 that I will remember."
"Taj has given us a wonderful memory, in all honesty. A special mention to Sneha at the front desk, Gagan at the Palace Services and the entire team who served us during our stay. Delighted is a very small word to describe what you have done for us. Taj's hospitality is undoubtedly unmatched. The little generous compliments took our stay and experience 10 notches higher!  The room was cozy, comfortable, the welcome drinks and the delicious chocolates, everything was totally marvellous! Cocktails and snacks at the Palace Lounge was great. I must mention, each and every staff at The Taj Mahal is absolutely courteous and caring for the guests.  We regret we missed out on the cognac and chocolates session at night. We also regret that we could not spend more time in the hotel, did"
"If it is in your price range to  book this place - do it.   You won't be disappointed.   Great location, staff and food.   Worked our way through the whole drinks menu and when you do that along with a bottle of vintage Krug to finish off the evening you really do get exceptional service and snacks.   "
"Fantastic hotel great location directly opposite gateway to India. The pool doesn't have sun all day and none at all after about 330. We had a room in the tower for a couple of nights with just a view of the street then moved to a club room in the main hotel overlooking the pool an amazing room it was huge. As you would expect the staff are very attentive. Breakfast is typical large hotel fayre lots of choice and delicious. The club lounge is not exclusive anyone can go in and buy drinks, with the club room you get two hours complementary (but you get a menu with a price list which was a bit of a shock at first)."
"This hotel has to be one of the top hotels I've stayed in we had a club room worth the money. The hotel itself is amazing it's old but inside very plush , the staff are wonderful they cannot do enough for you. Breakfast is awesome so much to choice from. The rooms are spacious and comfortable the bed is extra large . I would definitely come here again and would recommend this hotel ."
"5 star all the way from reception, service, room and beauty.  We were asked to sit down while they sorted our rooms. While waiting, a pretty staff came and welcomed us with the traiditonal India way of dotting our foreheads and also giving us a traditional garland.   Once check in was ready  the receptionist escorted me to my room, gave a full briefing, and introduced me to the floor butler who quickly served me a welcome drink.   They think of everything.  The room is very well decorated and i love the open corridors and the delighful ornaments along the corridors.  Service from everyone was excellent. They really know how to pamper their guests. Truly 5 star in every word.  The location is right next to the Gate of India. Another plus point. "
This hotel is easily in the Top-10 of the world. The service is discreet yet nothing is left to chance in terms of the needs of the guest. There is a sort of perfection and attention to detail here that you only see at few places in the world.
The Taj Mahal Palace is arguably the most elegant hotel in Mumbai. I found the hotel to be well decorated and staffed. The rooms are of a premium quality and ideal for foreign visitors as well. The charm of this hotel stems from its history.
This hotel is definately stuck in time.  It is run like an old British manor down to high tea.  The staff is pleasant but sometimes a little over the top.  The best part about staying here is the people watching.  There are many people that feel that because they can afford to stay here that they are better than everyone else.  Man is it funny.  The rooms are okay but we found our 5 nights very loud and non-restful.  We probably would not stay here again but it was central to all the things we wanted to do this time in Mumbai.  Security though assuring is also a pain when you just want to get to your room.  Taj always seems to b the target of mis-happenings in India so if you stay here you will always have to deal with security.
"The Taj is situated right next to the India Gate and Colaba the shopping area. The hotel has been wonderfully refurbished since the bombing in 2008. The hotel is large and although the staff try incredibly hard it loses a little people warmth, but do not let this put you off there are far worse top class hotels who do not do as well as the Taj. You will find a mixture of people at the hotel from weddings to tourists to business. We were touring to see the Test Match. The rooms and room service were excellent. Transfers to and from airport were with excellent drivers and could not be faulted."
"If I can't stay at the Taj, it doesn' t feel like Mumbai ! This hotel is magnificent in every way- decor, service , ambience, food , location and the view from the rooms that overlook the sea  and 'The Gate way of India' make you feel the rich heritage and culture of the country."
"Excellent hotel and very attentive staff, the walls between the rooms are at best paper thin so I strongly recommend ear plugs, the hotel amenities are great and there are also some great local restaurants nearby within walking distance  The grandeur and history of the hotel are fascinating and all in all we really enjoyed our stay"
this has an old world charm about it. This place where time appears to have stopped. I loved my stay just for this reason. The entire place has hospitality and luxury down pat. It will pamper all its guests - and will ensure that you come back.
"I rarely give 5 stars to any property but feel even though we had a few problems with our first room, this does deserve the highest of ratings. Our first room was very musty and we did not feel this was acceptable considering we were staying 8 days, however we were moved with little fuss and received a lovely letter from the manager the next day, it is how problems are rectifiedthat is important. The heritage wing is stunning, flowers amazing, and staff helpful and friendly. The rooms although not your normal standard 5 star luxury are comfortable and kept beautifully clean, bed and pillows very comfortable. The attention to detail by room staff was fantastic. The sea lounge for breakfast is lovely and of a very high standard, if you are lucky enough to be in a club room or"
"Staying at Taj is always an experience, but when it comes to the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai it crosses all expectations. The heritage property which is a pride to Mumbai and India is maintained with integrity, modernized yet retains its colonial charm. Our room in the Palace wing was majestic. There are many restaurants to choose from, we had brunch at Shamiana. It was a large fare with 40+ desserts to choose from. Our breakfast was at the Sea Lounge, they offer a variety of breakfast items to suit all nationalities. The staff is the most courteous and engage you with stories about the hotel. We got a complimentary late checkout which scored them brownie points. We missed having dinner at Souk the rooftop restaurant. They truly know how to make you feel special and ensure"
"The courtesy, the care, the services and attention given by the staff would make your stay a life changing experience. Each and every detail of the hotel were taken care of. They have very innovative ideas, which we didn't experience elsewhere in the world. Being a frequent traveller, and experiencing the leading hotels of the world, I can say this is one of the best hotel i've stayed in."
Awesome Hotel (best in word in my view) with Taj Heritage and tower end with modern touches throughout. The Staff pride themselves in being the best - they aspire to work in the best Hotel and are very knowledgeable in their roles they conduct daily. Nothing is beyond their capability to assist you. . Value for money is excellent!!
Visited in December 2016 and all I can say is that it was a very memorable experience. We had a room in the palace wing and the same was very well appointed.  The heritage walk is a great thing and not to be missed at all! Palace lounge offers fantastic views of the sea and a great place to unwind with a good read! The service was great with everybody trying to make you feel special.
"I'm a member of Taj inner circle.   Despite having platinum status with the Marriott, I started staying at the Taj for 2 reasons 1) After the hotel suffered following the attacks in Bombay, I thought it was important to support a historic property like Taj hotel 2) out of immense respect for the brand that Ratan Tata represented.  In Aug 2016, I made plans to stay at the Taj Mahal palace in Bombay and had the most distressing experience. I was asked to pay ~ 1200 INR extra per night because I had a family member staying with me. In the last 4-5 years that I stayed at the Tak, including last year in several different cities, I always has a family member stay with me, without extra cost. During a typical stay, I end up spending 500-1000USD on top of room charges. However, I didn't"
"Stayed in the Heritage wing of this wonderful hotel and it was a great experience- no detail of service was overlooked, the food was great and it was a marvellous haven in Mumbai! Make sure you take the tour they offer or just wander the corridors and appreciate the wonderful art, antiques and photographs."
We were a group of 20 people and in-spite of having prior appointment we were not assisted with the show around of the hotel as most of their areas were restricted. It is definitely an amazing structure to have stood for so many years. However hospitality needs to continue failing which you may just have unsatisfied guests.
Top quality staff location and food  Brilliant experience with the hotel offering everything you could wish for  Rooms very clean and bed very comfortable. Great bars and restaurants  I would defend mutely stay again  
Wonderful hotel with excellent service. Friendly and helpful staff. Magnificent restaurants with excellent food. With a plus foor the Chines restaurant 'Golden Dragon'. Very beautiful and practical rooms.  Must stay when visiting Mumbai.
"Hotel is amazing, great location and great views. From the airport pick up to the last day we were treated like royalty, the customer service of the hotel is the real plus, all staff are so welcoming and attentive. Simply this has to be the best hotel in the world."
"Our first stay at the Taj. We had a room in the heritage part of the hotel overlooking the gate. Stunning views. Stunning building. Great room on the 4th floor  was very quiet.Overlooking the gate and the sea giving some stunning sunset and sunrise views. The hotel airport transfer was not cheap but well worth it. A Chauffuer driven Tata Aria. We were welcomed on arrival and personally  checked in by Mohinder into our room. What a welcome.  The hotel stands out as one of the world's Icononic places to stay. Staff are all very  friendly courteous and go the extra mile.  The attention to detail in all aspects of the hotel is second to none, from the nightime turndown service , through to the pool towels service nothing is too much trouble.  Various restaurants are available and a"
It was awesome hotel. I like it very much. And I want to go again and again. Services is so nice. And everything is good. I'll go again and again. I wish I can stay in hotel taj for my whole life. Thank you so much. 
This was my first visit for a stay in Mumbai in any hotel as you don't usually get an opportunity to stay in a hotel in the city of your residence. We were given an upgrade in a room on the second floor which also had a balcony. The most striking features are the paintings and the antiques that you get to see on your way to the room. You truly feel that you are a part of the heritage and the staff ensure that they make you feel comfortable with the trademark Taj hospitality. I had dinner at Masala Kraft which served some amazing north Indian food. Overall one can only be impressed by the way Taj has preserved this 113 year old property without losing its original character. Keep it up.
"This graceful property has over 100 years of history, mostly beautiful true stories of glamour and royalty and romance.  Some tragic hours at the hands of terrorists have not taken away from the serenity and elegance that abounds in every corner of this hotel.  The staff are unobtrusive and yet completely attuned to each guest, with the purest desire to please each person.  There is nothing to compare with the warmth and hospitality from the front desk to the bell man to the pool attendants.  Beautiful beyond words. The ultimate definition of luxury and service."
"If you are hesitating between the Taj and the Oberoi, stop.  The Taj is much more charming, historic and its location is amazing. 5 minutes away by foot from shops and restaurants.  Also try the Golden Dragon Chinese restaurant at the Taj. I go to China every month and this was delicious Chinese food which feel like a good alternative to Indian food for a change. Also, if you are hesitating with the Taj Palace or the Tower, got to the Palace. Once again, you feel special when you stay at this historic hotel. Really worth the price."
"Great location, wonderful facilities, terrific service levels, shame that the bedrooms are tired and to be honest smelled a bit of damp (no, we weren't there in monsoon).  A great shame as this would be a truly great hotel if they would sort this out."
We booked the Taj as the treat to the end of our 21 nights travelling in India.  I feel pampered from the moment I walk through the door and the level of service is impeccable.  Breakfast is a feast and once again we enjoyed the delights of both the Maharajah high tea and spa treatments
Thank you Taj for making my birthday so memorable. Great service from room staff to butlers to reception to concierge. look forward to staying there next year. Special thanks to Aditya for ensuring our stay was memorable.
"This is the first lusxury hotel in India, with the 1st and 2nd ever licensed bars in India also.  The history of the hotel is astonishing. BBC even made a documentary about it!  I was lucky enough to stay here for only a short time but the hotel made the stay very memorable. Our room looked directly at the Gateway Of India. And the concierge was extremely helpful. I was picked up from the airport by a hotel car and then when explaining htat we had a very limited time and wanted to visit all of the main sites as well as the Dharavi slums they managed to pack it all in.  We used a hotel chauffeur as our tour guide of the sites. And he was excellent, knowledgable and very informative.  I would definitely stay here if i were to visit Mumbai again!"
"If you want to pamper yourself, or want to spend some quality time with yourself or anybody else-you can do it here. if you want to just laze around and do nothing just to rejuvenate yourself-go to this place. The service is par excellence. There is no hotel I've been to and I have travelled that can match up to the service of this hotel. The staff is so very tuned into looking after you without being intrusive. The room itself though small is so comfortable. Care is taken to ensure that you have everything you need to make your stay memorable. The little things they do make you feel so special. we were out when they came in to do the evening service and we returned to rose petals on our bath tub and a little petals decoration on the floor which was so beautiful. I can just"
"We stayed in the Palace Wing, where the rooms are smaller than is usual in Asian luxury hotels but the decor and appointments are wonderful. There was even a butler, dedicated to the floor, who could take care of your every need! In addition we were able to take breakfast in the Sea Lounge and had access to the Palace Lounge on the ground floor which provided complimentary drinks all day and snacks between 1530 and 1730. Only three gripes: 1) Very few English TV stations other than old films, CNN, BBC World and sports. Why not mainstream UK TV channels? 2) The service could be just too overpowering, e.g. up to four interruptions each evening asking if we needed anything, wanted the bed turning down, any extra water, etc. 3) When the hotel provides a half-day sightseeing tour,"
You should stay here at least once in your life. A hotel like no other. Not close to the airport but right next to the India Gate. Excellent breakfast buffet. Nearby to shopping areas. The service is unsurpassed.
"I was a little wary of my first trip to INdia. What a way to bed down those nerves!! Securely away from Mumbai's ""hustle"" (yes, I got into it later) this is a superb launching place to discover a great city in an AWESOME country.  Rooms in the old part are a bit noisy on the ocean side…but the view is worth it. Pool big but a bit cool and not enough lounging spots. Service is exemplary. Breakfast is great. Location perfect"
"Stayed for 8 nights, booked a sea room view but got 'upgraded' to a room in Tower area. Room was very spacious, clean, well appointed, with kettle, teas and coffees, basic hairdryer, bathrobes, stationery, TV, phone, good lighting, big bathroom (walk in shower no bath). Toiletries are restocked on request, bed linen changed every two days, air con excellent. Pool area and bars are very good, didn't try the restaurants as there are places to eat locally that are way way cheaper and food excellent. Breakfast and high tea in sea lounge is a must but tea will set you back £50. Gardens are immaculately kept, architecture is fabulous as are the staff, evening get bbq  by pool nothing special. All this comes at a cost though!!!!!!"
"Had a night at the Taj Palace Hotel, Mumbai a year on from my last stay at this truly magnificent hotel. As always was greeted warmly on arrival and booked into the Palace wing, where on check in I was upgraded to a Palace suite with views that overlooked India Gate. On being escorted to my room I received a welcome drink from the Butler who showed around the room and advised me of the amenities of the Suite and the hotel, advising me he was available 24 hours a day should I be in any need of assistance.   The Suite was tastefully furnished with everything one could require during their stay. With access to the Palace lounge where one could enjoy afternoon High Tea to Chocolates and Cognac in the evening.   Once again another fantastic stay at the Taj Palace, which given every"
"I'm currently staying at the Taj for a week in the Tower wing. My overall thoughts are positive but as my stay has progressed I have felt some disappointment. Firstly, the Palace hotel is simply stunning. The service throughout the hotel has been generally outstanding. The breakfast also has been excellent. Unfortunately I've really felt a difference from staying in the Tower compared to the Palace. The Tower is at a very different standard to the Palace, which should be expected of course with the slightly lower price, but I feel this part of the hotel cannot be rated 5*. - the carpets in the common areas aren't fitted correctly, with gaps and temporary fixes which make it look shabby. - Construction work has been going on some nights until 10pm despite the hotel saying they"
"The service staff is excellent.  The rooms in the ""Palace Wing"" are superb, with a great view of the Gate of India and the Arabian Sea beyond.  The breakfasts are first rate, particularly the baking (the best anywhere we stayed -- all 5 star locations --  in India.  This is the place to book in Mumbai, but particularly if you pay the well-worth-it increment for the Palace Win g rooms overlooking the sea."
"Taj Hotels generally have very good service but the Mumbai Taj Mahal Hotel provided an outstanding quality of value and service during our stay in Nov. 2016. The room, food, and service were the best compared to the other top hotels in the world"
On arrival my wife had been unwell with a high temperature for a few days and the hotel had been made aware of this. We were quickly checked in to an upgraded room on the fourth floor of the old building and a doctor attended within an hour.  A prescription the doctor ordered from our room arrived as she left. The service was caring and very kind.   We ordered  some very light food from room service that evening and the chap who delivered it enquired how she was feeling. At breakfast the next day she was still a little weak but the staff in the restaurant inquired as to her health and if she needed anything special? How did they know this? We certainly didn't tell them and just turned up for a table! This hotel has been the subject of film and documentaries and is an amazing
"We stayed in this iconic sea facing landmark hotel in South Mumbai.and food quality was amazing. from freshly squeezed juices, very authentic south Indian breakfast dishes, to made to order omelettes and great choice of breads..."
We found the Taj Palace at Mumbai lived up to all expectations. Staying in the Palace wing was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The facilities and especially the Chinese restaurant were excellent. Couldn't be a better location for sightseeing Mumbai
"The food was great and the bill was surprisingly reasonable . To have a drink and a meal was my wife's and daughter's dream, hence we made the trip to this hotel after visiting the Elephanta Caves.  But the staff attitude needs re-examination. We were asked to move away from the seating area because we were not staying at the hotel. If there had been a notice saying as such we would not have sat there. After the meal I paid for it with my MasterCard, and after struggling for a few minutes, the server marched me to the main counter and who then asked me whether my card was an international one! The bill was for £90 by the way for the four of us.  I paid with the same card at a top hotel in Chennai, £240 for seven diners, and did not have any problems. I understand that this hotel"
"I have visited recently Bombay first time after 25 years. My partner has never been there before. So, to get him hooked on India and introduce him at first smoothly I have decided to book our first night in Taj, which I have seen before once years ago but heard about it a lot of good things. And it did not disappoint :)  We have not stayed unfortunate;y in one of its best suits (maybe one day. when I win a lottery :) ), but even our room in Tower wing had a lot of charm and pretty interesting views. Loved the service, every member of staff seemed so genuinely glad that they can be our hosts, everybody was so helpful and always smiling.  Breakfast buffet choice and food quality was amazing. from freshly squeezed juices, very authentic south Indian breakfast dishes, to made to"
"We could not  fault the hotel and its service - 5 star luxury all round and a fabulous position. The staff were fabulous, especially the room staff. Great harbour view from the Taj Palace building. However we had a really disappointing meal in the hotel's Lebanese restaurant ""Souk"". It lacked flavour, the moussaka was bland and luke warm, and a second order of bread finally turned up only after we had finished the meal. Ottolenghi would not have been impressed! We will be eating elsewhere tonight, which is a shame as it has put us off trying the other in house restaurants. Then we went to bed and from 10.30pm to 1.30am we had the joy of incredibly loud music coming through the door from a party. Apologies were made next morning when we appeared bleary eyed, and we got a"
"Out of our price bracket,but well worth a visit for a drink,the inside is totally amazing and the staff attentive,as I said earlier a bit pricey for us,but I'm glad we saw it in all it's splendour. It's hard to believe that it was attacked eight years Go."
"A huge building located in the coastal road  opposite Indian Gate and close to all kind of services including local, middtirian and international restaurants. The hotel is very luxurious and provides excellent services to all guests."
"The iconic Taj Mumbai for us feels like coming back home. As always, we stayed in the tower, which is the modern version of the adjacent classic Taj. The view from above over The Gate of India, the sea beyond it and the sunrise over the gate is magnificent.  This time we were on the 10th floor and upon arrival we were treated to a spectacular pageant show below in celebration of India's Navy Day. The service in all Taj hotels is impeccable, the pool is perfect, the food is great and the location in Colaba is second to none. In all our numerous trips to Mumbai, we stayed in the Taj, but we always love the very last day of our trips before we fly back home. It is the sweetest way to say goodbye to this stunning country and city and carry with us the best memories until the next"
"My significant other was staying in The Taj Mahal Palace for a week and as I wanted to surprise him with something, I wrote to the the hotel, asking to arrange him a surprise to his room (because I was in Europe myself). And it was fantastic! They replied me within a few hours and promised they will decorate the room and include everything I kindly asked them to.  He was so surprised when he got to his room - the room was filled with balloons, flowers, rose petals, a chocolate cake and Indian sweets with a note that I asked them to leave there.  They definitely go the extra mile to make their guests feel special and I'm definitely going to visit them next time I'm in India. Just wonderful!"
"The staff, facilities, and food were excellent!  This is the best hotel I've stayed in and probably one of the top hotels in the world! Every detail was meticulously organized and planned! Highly recommended!"
"This hotel was the highlight of my vacation to Mumbai. GREAT!!!  I recommend this hotel to everyone.  Book a driver and tour too.  Lovely staff.  Food can be overpriced, try Leopolds cafe around the back streets."
"We spent our second two nights at the Taj as my wife celebrated her birthday there over two nights before we moved on to Kerala. Despite the manic currency issue and USA president elections going on at the same time the hotel did everything in its power to make my wife's birthday so special! Cake[s], balloons and decorated bedroom linen, rose petals and even 'Happy Birthday' played on the piano. The time spent around the pool was very enjoyable and there is no doubt the facilities are top rate. The memorial to the people who died in the atrocious attack was touching and subtle too and I cannot thank all the staff enough for their attention and service."
"I stayed with my family in the last week of November'16 for 4 days in the Heritage section of the hotel and all I can say that the stay has been super fantastic.   The porch area is really small and one has to get down or board the vehicle with lightening speed as there is always queue building up, but the staff also manages everything with lightening speed and with in seconds you are welcomed inside.  The new lobby is beautiful and one corner has a ""survivor tree"" along with the ""32 names"" and serene wall which has constant flowing water. Other side of the lobby takes you towards the escalators for Tower wing. In the middle of the lobby area every day there is a huge fresh flower decoration which is also a favorite picture spot and the reception has a massive and very"
Once I got past the shock- and then the piece of mind- of our car getting checked for bombs upon entering the gates... I was in love with this place!  Great service doesn't even begin to describe how everyone in the hotel goes out of their way to make you feel special and relaxed.  Our luggage was lost at the airport and they were on it and kept us updated.  They left gifts for us in the room like a beauty mask and a necklace.  The food is amazing and so are the grounds. I'm just sorry we never took time to swim in that beautiful pool.  Don't forget to tune into the ongoing documentary of the hotel on your TV in the room.  Seriously this hotel was the best part of Mumbai. 
"One of our most favourite hotels in the world - it has a lovely relaxed feeling - not at all stuffy. Understated luxury. We stayed 18th November to 24th November 2016 in  Taj Palace wing Club room on the 6th floor. The Colonial style Palace Wing building is full of charm, simply stunning, The staff, without exception, are so friendly and welcoming, after a day or so they were remembering and calling us by name. Everything was perfect for the entire stay, so have no negative comments whatsoever. We would never stay at any other hotel in Mumbai."
"Mumbai is home to this iconic structure…and a visit here to this palatial hotel should be on the must do list of every traveller…the location is amazing, with the Gateway of India  and the vast ocean making it picture perfect!! I have repeatedly stated, no one welcomes you like the Taj! they exist just to make every experience beautiful for their guests, the epitome of elegance and service, the Taj hospitality is unbeatable. Our thanks to Harshal at the front office for making our check in so smooth & Mr. Bhatia for making sure we wasted no time at check out, our thanks to Shankar ji and Mr. Percy at the Sea lounge for taking such good care of us at every meal. Now let me tell you about the EXECUTIVE SUITE,it's luxurious, spacious and so cosy you feel very much at home,"
"Everything at the hotel was exceptional.  I would undoubtedly stay here again.  The room was exceptionally clean and the room was always serviced timely, not to mention again at the turn-down service.  One of best showers I have ever experienced."
Just the most luxurious and elegant - welcoming and beautiful place to stay in Bombay right on the water and facing the Gateway of India surrounded by fun streets full of shops and restaurants. Safe and clean. Staff so super friendly it was almost too much :)
"During our 29 day India adventure, I always treat my group to a 5 Star experience in an Indian Hotel. And the Taj in Mumbai never fails to totally impress. As soon we enter the scented lobby, the magic begins. The stunning floral arrangements beckon and coupled with a seamless check-in, and a welcome drink and ceremony, how could we not be totally impressed!  Every detail at the Taj is looked after, and it is the attention to such details - such as returning to your room and seeing that the attendant has velcro wrapped your phone and computer cards neatly or your toileteries in the washroom have been neatly arranged and placed on a special mat - make a stay at the Taj consistently awesome.  The breakfast service itself deserves a full essay but suffice it to say that anything"
"Hotel was good, friendly staff but could have been more helpful in the sence that tourist suffered from the currency banned in India. Very elegant hotel, location is perfect close to restaurants, local markets and other monuments. Food was good too, but a little pricey compared to other local restaurants near by."
"Was here recently for a quick beer with clients. Very nice view of the gateway, good selection of spirits and wines. They serve you some unique small bites like lotus seeds etc - quite nice. Very friendly and efficient staff as expected from the Taj !!!"
"A restful, luxurious, and vaguely embarassed getaway from the bustle of Mumbai but still close to all you need.  Sitting in the courtyard is like sitting in a James Bond movie.  Watch out though for the bill at checkout."
I have been to many hotels in my lifetime. But this is one of the most magical I ever stayed at. The service is impeccable. The staff so welcoming and the rooms truly luxurious. We stayed in the old part of the hotel and I can only recommend for rooms there. The breakfast is everything you can ask for. Great variety and great quality of everything available. So if you want to feel like a Maharadscha or Maharani you have to stay here.
I stayed here for 3 nights and had a good time. The check-in process took sometime though the staff was very courteous and seated me in the lounge while it was going on.  I stayed in the Palace wing. It is of course a bit old but well maintained. I was really impressed with the beautiful architecture there. It almost looked like a palace. It's located kind of in the middle of the city right across form the Gateway of India. Hence the view is great and accessibility is also good. The housekeeping staff were also wonderful . One day I was surprised to see a beautiful brass basin with rose petals and a pack of salt scrub left in my room for a foot soak. It's these small gestures that set a hotel apart and endears it to you.
"This is the best hotel I've stayed at anywhere in the world. Well worth every penny. A comparable hotel in US, if even existed, would be closer to $1,000 a night. The service is unparalleled, the pool alone is worth the money, and they have free history tours for guests each night. Can't say how great this place is. If in Mumbai, stay here at least one night."
"Located opposite Gateway Of India, this hotel has been an Iconic architecture in the history of India's hospitality Industry. Must visit for any foreigner visiting Mumbai.   You get a magnificent view of Arabian Sea from your rooms and restaurants. Some very good restaurants for celebrating personal events like bday and anniversary.   Overall a great hotel! thumbs_up"
On arrival we were pleasantly surprised to be told that we were to be upgraded to a suite in the Palace Wing and then presented with a birthday cake to celebrate my wife's birthday. There is so much to see and do at the hotel that a two night stay just isn't enough and the staff could not do enough to fulfil your requests. Check in and check out were faultless
Arriving at just about checking in time we were greeted expertly by Ninod who gave us a very pleasant surprise by announcing that we had been given an upgrade to a suite in the Palace side of the hotel. Unfortunately there was so much to take in at the décor and ambiance of the hotel that much of what he said went over my head and when we were taken to our suite we were lost for words at the opulence of the rooms and further delighted when a birthday cake was delivered to help celebrate my Wife's birthday. Our only regret was that it was only a two night stay and we weren't able to experience all of the delights that the hotel had to offer. It cost more than we would normally spend on a hotel but we knew we would not be disappointed and we would be happy to return and be able to
"You may think that India is noisy, crowded and dirty, which it can be, but this is a perfect place to imagine that it isn't. With wonderful views from the bay-front rooms and breakfast room and absolutely impeccable service the not insubstantial cost suddenly seems worth it. It extends your tourist day from the moment that you arrive until you fall asleep in their comfortable beds. If you can, indulge."
"Wonderful hotel, spotlessly clean with polite, helpful staff.  We stayed in the original Palace wing and were very pleased with our quiet large room which had plenty of seating, excellent lighting and all amenities in the bathroom.  We didn't have a view of the Gateway to India but it didn't matter.  We ate in Wasabi Japanese restaurant and Masala Kraft Indian.  Both meals were delicious.  Breakfast is in a bright, light room.  Try to grab a table by the window overlooking the Gateway.  Light meals are served by the swimming pool, very British Raj!  The hotel is opposite the Gateway and a short walk to the boat that takes you to Elephanta Caves which are highly recommended.  Be aware that there is a 25% tax on food and drinks in this hotel."
We stayed here for our last few nights in India. We were treated like royalty from the moment we were picked up to the moment we were dropped off at the airport. Food was great - you have to try the sushi! Butler was very helpful and obliging. Really enjoyed chilling at the pool and the service of the poolboys was great.   The only negative is that it was very hard to leave!!!   Will definitely try to stay again. 
"Our stay in Taj Mahal Palace was truly unforgettable. Remarkable hospitality, one of worlds best hotel staff and most memorable ambiance created by truly caring management. Many thanks to very professional and helpful reservation staff particularly Reshma. The food in Masala Kraft was super and taste of incredible India!Thanks to Chef Apurva Panchal and the Palace Lounge staff during happy hours. We will visit Mumbai and re-new our pleasant memories again by staying in unique Taj Mahal Palace Hotel."
"We stayed at the Taj for two nights in November. On arrival we were upgraded to the palace wing, which was a lovely surprise. The service and attention to detail was impressive and nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. We were assigned a floor butler (Rakesh) who explained everything to us and was on hand if we needed him. He was excellent and made us feel at home.  The hotel itself is in an excellent location and is an oasis of grandeur and comfort.  Breakfast was varied and of a very good standard and the afternoon tea was lovely.  We can't wait to go back! "
This hotel is just incredible.  From the service from the staff to the decor of the entire hotel it is just perfect.  The staff at the front were very helpful in planning activities and for sightseeing in Mumbai and the housekeeping were the most attentive I have ever experienced.  The pool is such a relaxing spot after a hot long day of seeing Mumbai.  All the food we tried was delicious.  If you are looking for a luxurious hotel experience this is a must stay.
"Stay at taj is always great but when its taj mahal palace then its unforgettable. Stayed here once again and what a hotel it is. First ever luxury hotel of india and still it is best among all in india. Yummy food, happy to help with a smile staff with an absolute professionalism. Had lunc, dinner and breakfast too. Food was yummy and taste was out of d world. View of gateway of india from my room in d night is d pic I attached with d review here.  I always stay at taj when i come to mumbai. Lands end or santacruz in d recent past. Stayed here after a long time coz i had work in south mumbai this time. Will come again next time here only at taj mahal palace. Wish you all d very best for the future team taj mahal palace. Keep doing a fantastic job."
"Stayed here two nights in room 226 in the Palace rooms at the end of our tour of India and had a wonderful time. Everything from arrival to departure was dealt with by the hotel with courtesy and attention to the smallest detail. The decor and facilities are immaculate, the meals in the Souk, Sea lounge and Aquarius by the pool were delicious and the staff couldn't do enough for us. This is a world class hotel that really lives up to it's billing!"
"This is my favourite hotel in Mumbai, I stay here for 90% of my nights in Mumbai, for one reason: the excellence of the hotel.  One important thing is to make sure you stay in the palace wing, otherwise it is a complete different story, your experience can drop from excellence to ordinary.  I love the building, the room, the location, the pool, the bar by the pool, the sea lounge with give you direct view of gate of India and the sea. The service is the best you can find in India.   Breakfast at sea lounge is dreamy. It feels like travel back in time. There is also an excellent must try Japanese restaurant in the hotel.   The hotel locates in colaba, and you can easily walk around and indulge Mumbai!   The only thing is the internet is poor.   But after all, this is the hotel"
"It was our first trip to Mumbai. The purpose of visit was to attain a seminar and visit. We stayed 3 nights at Taj Mahal Palace and we really enjoyed it!  The experience at Taj was awesome:  1. Located in the heart of Mumbai (in front of Gateway of India) 2. Easy booking, reservation 3. Warm welcome  4. Best professionalism of all Taj Members 5. Luxurious facilities around the hotel  thanks entire Taj team for making our stay so fantastic."
"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Extremely warm and caring staff, beautiful and comfortable rooms. a perfect 10 on 10. My wife is has been particularly impressed with the hotel tour. My kids enjoyed themselves thoroughly every minute of their stay."
"i really liked my stay , it was my birthday & the hospitality recieved was great. Awesome treatment & the food was yum. Been to Taj before but here the experience was fabulous  .Thanks for great stay , you made my day more special"
"Well our tour of India was coming to an end, our final 2 nights were booked at The Taj by our amazing travel company India Someday. On arrival we were awe struck by the beauty of the hotel, the smell, the smiles, I had contacted asking about the Heritage Walk and the duty manager who checked us in confirmed we were on the list. Our room was stunning, the views over the sea and India Gate mesmerising. We ate in Souk - delicious  Sea Lounge for afternoon tea following the Heritage Walk, where the staff spoilt us with so many delicious titbits. Both mornings we visited Shalimar for breakfast, the pool was a delight, especially being handed a dry towel getting out, then offered fruit skewers and chilled water. We had every intention of seeing something of Mumbai, but will just have"
"It was a wonderful experience to stay here - the hotel has charm, elegance, style, character and is pure luxury as do all the Taj hotels.  I wouldn't choose another hotel in Mumbai to stay at.  Sunrises over the sea were spectacular, the breakfasts out of this world and the staff friendly and helpful."
"My second time to Mumbai, I wanted to stay in another hotel. I chose The Taj Mahal Palace. I am not disappointed, it's really the best hotel. The room is clean and the staff really friendly and helpful. It's heritage hotel and good location. "
What a wonderful experience. Service second to none and also the staff. Well worth the money and a not to be missed adventure. Our room was cleaned just 4 hours after our arrival as we had had tea and coffee in the room and a short nap. The ambiance is wonderful and everything about this hotel is magnificent and top quality.
"Great old hotel, rebuilt from scratch in part after the 26-11-2008 terrorist attacks.  Nicely down. Focused security is nbot oppressive even though being ever present at entrances and exits.  Palace wing rooms, especially the larger ones like 348, are exquisite with a great sight to boot."
"I have stayed at many hotels but the experience at Taj Palace is well above any others. The food is excellent, the staff is very courteous and welcoming, the welcome and departure events bring the Indian customs to forefront.  I would definitely encourage and recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to Mumbai."
"The grace and pace of the Taj Palace is beautifully judged. Views across the water from my bedroom window were full of present day business and the history of Mumbai. The art in the corridors and the constant smiles and greetings from the staff all made the days bright.  Some classy retail outlets in-house [should one call Dior and Vuitton ""retail outlets"", I wonder?].... and some fine dining: Chinese, Indian and Arabic/Mediterranean.  One needn't leave the hotel once inside but the city has museums and art galleries within walking distance and some splendid nineteenth century buildings. It's a city full of wonders. And a hop over to Elephant Island from the Gateway is a memorable treat.  The hotel makes a wonderful statement for Mumbai and India and I was delighted to spend"
Wouldnt have expected anything more than what I gained during my anniversary at 'The Taj Mahal Palace'.  Perfectly executed service mindset filled with subtle surprises. Made our DAY and provided memories for a lifetime.
most beautiful monument in India.There are different kinds of things that will make you amazed i promise you that because it is a place of wonder as you all know it is in the 7 wonders of the world globe_showing_Europe-Africa 
"We stayed for two nights 2/3rd November. On arrival we were given an upgrade to a Palace room - definitely the part of the hotel to book if you can. Our room had a balcony overlooking the pool. The building itself is jaw dropping-especially the main staircase. However, the star attraction has got to be the staff. Never have we stayed anywhere with better staff. Nothing was too much trouble. From the waiters in the bars and restaurants to the gateman on the staircase. Everyone of them was delightful and made our stay a perfect introduction to India. Never have we smiled so much or been wished Good morning/afternoon/evening so often. Ok, it's not cheap but worth every penny. A great hotel! "
"Having stayed in Bengaluru and ridden the Golden Chariot we flew to Mumbai. Our car was waiting when we arrived. Driver was efficient, knowledgable and courteous. Arrival at the Taj was seemless, we were met and taken straight to our suite and introduced to our butler. Wow ... What a room, what an hotel and what service ... 100% recommend a stay here"
"Beautiful hotel situated by the Gate of India.  Centrally located, lots of shops within walking distance. The public areas of the hotel are stunning - truly a 5* property.  Flower arrangements, decor, everything is done with great taste and flare.  The rooms, the restaurants, service, public areas all outstanding.  We had meals in 3 restaurants which were all excellent.  All of the staff that we dealt with were above and beyond professional and friendly.   Highly recommend the Taj Mahal Palace."
"My first stay in Taj Mahl Palace & Tower was fabulous. You made us feel special, I liked the surprises which where stored for me in house.  This is going to stay long in my memory. It was a pleasure visiting the Hotel."
Arrived at the hotel real late at night and stayed for just about 12 hours at the hotel. although the hotel was on 100 percent occupancy the next day i was given a late check out option.Check in was done real quick check out was a little delayed but that i guess was because of the demonetization issue! but overall a comfortable stay!
The Taj  was everything I could have imaged !! . Felt like transported back to a by gone age and treated like Royalty . Great choice of restaurants ate in several food and service equally good . Enjoyed cocktails in The Harbour Bar just a little disappointed that the signature cocktail unavailable but second choice was lovely .   Would will return one day .
"Staying here for 2 days following a bad experience with a Taj group hotel in Varanasi which caused us to be concerned about our upcoming stays.  We didn't need to worry as everything about this hotel is wonderful.  We had been unable to book rooms in the palace itself & had room in the tower booked but upgraded on arrival to the heritage rooms in the palace itself.  Where do we start..... From the fabulous room, to the extremely good service with wonderful rose petal bowls to soak feet in at the end of each tiring day.  Had seen the documentary on this hotel & wanted to stay here& would recommend it to anyone visiting Mumbai.  Excellent location, excellent staff, wonderful food & fabulous patisserie.  The entire hotel is full of history, it is elegant and transports you back to"
"Whilst this is up there with all the other Asian iconic hotels, it is the level of friendly and attentive service from the staff that ensures that it stands out from the others. The upgrade to the old wing is worth it. "
"Everytihng so perfect.  I sitll wonder why the man at the lobby could find my name without checking my passport  He said 'Are you Mr xxx?  Welcome. Anyway, it is series of my surprise  during stay how people are trained to entertain the customer.  I have less interested in Mumbai itself but I really wish to come again only for staying this hotel, hopefully with my familiy next time."
Suite room. Facilities excellent from in room amenities to room service. The service received throughout the hotel cannot be faulted. The standard and variety of meals were excellent as were the restaurants. As my wife had her 60th birthday the room was decorated with balloons and flowers and a special cake was provided by room service.  The suite was freshly decorated with flowers during our stay. Our every need was well catered for for morning breakfast to afternoon tea in the Palace lounge.   The environment around the swimming pool was kept clean especially keeping the birds away with a special netting high above the pool area. The gym has all the equipment necessary and is in excellent order with a well knowledgeable trainer in attendance.  Good access to local markets and
"The hotel lives up its reputation as the finest of Mumbai. The property is tastefully decorated and filled with classy floral arrangements. The staff are very attentive and go above and beyond to ensure that you feel special and well look-after. This sets the property apart from its competitors.  There are a few minor areas that can be further improved. Wait staff and runners at the Sea Lounge tend to drag their footsteps which make noises when they are walking around in their slippers. It is also worth noting that runners / assistants at the restaurants are very helpful but not trained sufficiently on how to engage or correspond with customers.  Moreover, the marble of my Palace wing bathroom has sign of large water damages. The white marble has unfortunately turned yellow."
"The location of this heritage property by the Gate of India is second to none. The grandeur of its public areas stunning. The service at all points beyond reproach. The comfort of the rooms, the food, the whole package absolutely sublime. All staff are considerate, polite but never stuffy; they are all dressed in wonderful costumes. I felt I'd gone to Heaven - never been treated like this - ever"
"Viaje a la India por 5 semanas, terminando en Mumbai.  Fue mi ultima parada y decidi quedarme en un hotel de 5 estrellas.  Llegue enferma y fue un alivio llegar a este excelente hotel.  La administracion del hotel se ocupo de enviar a un medico, gracias al cual obtuve el medicamento necesario para disfrutar el resto de mi estancia en la India.    En una ciudad como Mumbai y viajando sola, el hotel me sirvio de ancla para disfrutar del festival a Ganesh, descansar, y sentirme segura en la ciudad.  *  I traveled India for 5 weeks and Mumbai was my last stop.  I decided to stay in a 5 star hotel as Mumbai is a large city and I was ill.  As soon as I got to the hotel, the concierge had a Doctor sent to my room.  The Dr obtained the necessary medication, had it sent to my room, and I"
"Could not speak highly enough of the elegance of the Palace hotel Beautiful furniture throughout, artfully selected for each space. There is also a newer tower which we didn't get to see.   The service from the staff is extremely good. Nothing was too much trouble.  Our room was spacious as was the bathroom.   The only thing I'd say is the architecture amplifies sound. There was a wedding in the ballroom on Saturday night which went on in to the small ours with seriously loud pumping music so we didn't get much sleep that night.  It wouldn't put me off staying there again though.   There is also an art gallery in the hotel that is well worth checking out."
"Simply a pure history location! One of the best hotels ever....it'is everything perfect, pure indian luxury and hospitality at max level...beautiful, astonishing, amazing....I'm grateful to having been visited such a monumental hotel."
"My friend and I like to travel and short trips to India are among our favorite travels if for no other reason than that we can reach most of the country by air within 3 to 3 and a half hours.  This was by far our favorite trip and all we did was spend the weekend in this hotel.  The Taj Mahal Palace hotel was like stepping into heaven on Earth.  From our personal butler to the pool attendants everyone treated us as though we were the most interesting and important guests they had ever had.  I have paid more for other hotels, too.  This was very reasonably priced at less than 300 dollars per night.  I would highly recommend that anyone traveling to Mumbai, even if traveling on a budget, as we were, spend at least one night at this hotel.  Ask for the palace wing, relax, and enjoy!"
" Nothing to say but stunning. Beautiful place, right in front of the Gateway and the bay. Beautiful building, as much inside as outside. Fantastic flowery decor. Great city garden, with large pool. Competent personnel, even if some tend to sometimes cross the line between ""up"" and ""condescending"". Not enough to change my mind about the place, but worth keeping in check."
This is top most hotel in mumbai.The sea view from balcony is amazing.The room service is awesome.Food is very delicious.The hotel staff is very friendly and polite.The experience of this hotel is like never before.You must visit this hotel at least one time.From onwards when I visit Mumbai I will prefer to stay in Taj Hotel.It is not less than Taj Mahal of Agra.
"The hotel is beautiful inside and out. The rooms are luxurious, with marble bathroom, well appointed, and an entryway comfortable to keep the luggage. Our room faced the street (and the Gate of India) and therefore was noisy. Rather than sea view I recommend the pool-view. Excellent service, and a few restaurants to choose from. The yoga class, though, was a joke. 20 minutes of not even the basics with an ""instructor"" that didn't know what he was doing."
Hotel from the Taj chain located in front of the sea and the Indian Gate. We were in the Tower and the room was a bit of old standard and a bit small for this class of hotel. The room was also noisy as it was a communicating one. The multi-cuisine restaurant is excellent and the buffet sumptuous. The staff is courteous but a bit sluggish.
"I could not have imagined a better hotel to stay at. Was here for 3 nights for business. The rooms were spectacular, the main lobby was very grand and the restaurants in the hotel were all top notch. Staff were very friendly and tended to all your needs. "
"This hotel is beyond your imagination. It is a wonderful place with many historic aspects. This is a place where you don't want to go for just sleeping but a place where you enjoy the beauty. Wonderful room, excellent service, very good restaurants and shops, nice swimming pool and spa as well as a complimentary yoga session in the morning, and many places where you can sit and just enjoy the atmosphere. We celebrated my moms Birthday here and the reception team, housekeeping team and restaurant team surprised my mother with many wonderful things on this day. She felt like in heaven and I must admit that I felt so too.  Go and find out for yourself. Choose the ""old"" part of the hotel and a room to the sea front. These are more expensive but it is worthwhile!!!!"
"Fabulous hotel. The building is beautiful, excellent restaurant options and exceptional service. I had a spa treatment which was one of the best I've experienced. The only criticism I have is that the bed was a little hard for my taste. It didn't detract from the overall experience though."
"Nothing exceptional about this famous location.  It is a modern tourist trap, with an endless number of tourists falling over each other "" to make photos and use the ground floor toilet....all free of charge....  The service concept of luxury has been lost, waiting at the coffee shop, out of 3 barbecue items, only 2 are available, the same applies to deserts.  Residents cannot reserve a dinner table at the pool.  Plenty of back packers, especially on Saturday and Sunday, the lobby resembles a department store sales floor.  There is a confusion between the Tower customer and the "" double paying"" Palace guests, the service is indifferent.  The lounge resembles a three star hotel outfit and not a famous five star hotel.  I wanted to make a 11 room block booking for a week in"
"This hotel is the flagship of the TAJ chain of hotels and it is truly amazing.  The palace wing of the hotel is the original hotel and it has a more modern section next door.  We were greeted with personal check-in and oriented to the hotel and room.  An wonderful experience in the two days we stayed there.  Breakfast and dinner surpassed expectations.  Also, the heritage tour of the hotel is worth participating in. Definitely worth staying at."
"We just completed our three week trip in India with a three day stay at the Taj Mahal Palace.  The service was absolutely outstanding.  The concierges were great, the floor butlers were excellent (there is a butler assigned to every floor).  In fact, everyone we encountered were interested in helping us and making sure we were happy with our stay.  They made a birthday surprise for my wife with balloons and flowers (free of charge).  They helped us with a gift for one of our guides since we had no access to cash with India's currency problems.  We loved the welcome gifts they provided (prayer, holistic necklaces made from the basil plant)  We had views of the Gateway Arch and waterfront which was well worth the money.  The hotel is beautiful with historical character and an"
"Very accommodating hotel. Had a crib ready for our baby, even left her a new stuffed animal, Johnson and Johnson baby lotion and soap. Cocktails at the Harbour bar are a must and the breakfast buffet was delicious. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Mumbai, it was worth the price. "
"From the moment I got out of the taxi to when we entered the Taj Palace Hotel we were greeted with smiles and made so welcome.  The hotel has everything you need, good views, excellent service, in house shopping, great food and well appointed rooms. I enjoyed every minute of my stay."
"Always been biased towards the Taj Hotels and for good reason too..but this Hotel is an experience The History in the place...The Grit of Mr Tata to build it in British Times and the resolve of the Current Mr Tata to restore the same glory post the mumbai attacks is something which you experience when you stay here The service,staff everything else is Taj..everything is yes,with a smile...so all top notch..but the hotel itself is like a palace museum....do go and stay here if you can....will definitely go back if in my budget"
"I just completed my two week trip to India.  I flew into Delhi and flew out of Mumbai.  I had very low expectations of Mumbai.  After the trip, my opinion of Mumbai is more or less the same.  I always expected my stay at Taj Mahal Palace to be the best thing about Mumbai.  It turns out that I was right.  Of course, the hotel doesn't come close to its namesake in Agra as an attraction in its own right.  Any such suggestion can only be made by those that never visited both.  Nevertheless, the Palace wing of this hotel is amazing.  My room had a clear view of the Gateway of India.  My hotel room seemed made entirely of marble.  Even the soap dish was made of stone.  Travel books warned me ahead of time that this hotel's service did not compare to that of the Oberoi chain.  My"
"We loved the building and the room. It is beautiful....however, we ordered one cocktail...very small at half a glass and very expensive! We asked for the glass to be filled, was not...two sips and it was gone.....disappointing. Don't mind paying the money if the glass is full.....We went outside the hotel to enjoy the evening with our group."
The Taj Mahal Palace continues to maintain its exclusive standards in all aspects!  The recent introduction of the lamp-lighting ritual in the evening ( 6 pm) adds to the tradition and culture of the place!  the flower arrangements at various spots are simply brilliant! the service in the rooms---old heritage wing--- continues to be superb yet discreet. The the breakfast options  are wide too--both at the Sea Lounge  and at the 24-hour restaurant!   Keep it up Taj!
"Its on amazing location the building is very good, we come from Taj Lands end and checked in for 3 nights at Taj mahal palace but while going in the room it was very stufy smelling like old things I could not stand the smell, I requested the reception to cancel the booking they refused and said will charge us, so we ask at list 2 nights instead of 3 nights they acceped, the hotel is very good service is wow but its very old hotel with 103 years, that's why its stufy they need to renovaite the rooms this is what made me not staying with them. I hard to go back to Taj Lands end"
"Airport transfers: - Expect to see Taj Mahal logo sign at exit - Wifi available in car, but weak  - Menu for food upon arrival available - Very passionate and helpful driver offering recommendations during stay.  - Expect your bags to leave your sight and end up in your room  Room and hotel: - Room was immaculate! - Strong reliable free wifi throughout  - Full western toilet experience - Included breakfast at Sea Lounge was over the top. Staff is spectacular, giving personalized touches - Expect to go through security scanner with each entry to hotel - 5pm daily hotel tour was crowded and long, but informative - Expect most guests to be 60-70 year old British  We didn't want to leave."
"You cannot fault this place. The real meaning of hospitality and service is derived from here. There's so many magical moments and attention to detail in every direction you look. The staff are simply the best attribute and nothing is too much trouble. I won't spoil it by giving away the delights, but please go the extra mile to get a club room in the palace wing. You will appreciate it from airport pick up to check out. We had a minor issue with a piece of broken glass in the room but the staff were very concerned and made a fuss."
"Extraordinary combination of luxury, comfort, and service in a historic icon of Mumbai. Based in the lively spot of Colaba, surrounded by the characteristic buildings of old Bombay and of course directly located next to ""The Gateway of India"""
We stayed here two years ago and it's better than ever. Thank you once again for the upgrade to a superior suite which gave us access to the Palace Lounge with all its benefits and extras. The staff as you would expect are extremely courteous and helpful and cannot do enough for you. Looking forward to our next visit. Denise and Brian Lawrence.
"We stayed in the Old part of the Taj Palace a few years back, but this year we stayed in the Tower. Although it has a fantastic view it was disappointing because it is just like any other hotel. The old part"
"Overall a great stay. This is my second stay here and this time I was staying in the old wing, which was so very regal! The overall experience is was great. I had some minor issues which were resolved promptly and with the highest level of professionalism. The team went out of their way to accommodate me. I do appreciate it guys and do not worry I shall be coming to stay again! Breakfast was superb and the eggs benedict were divine. Wifi worked brilliantly. The hotel is located within easy distance to the Leopold Cafe and Cafe Mondegar. Gateway to India is a view away from the Sea Lounge. Thanks again!"
"I heard alot about this hotel, so I went to have a coffee with my friends at the coffee shop. To my surprise everything I heard about it was totally different, our Coffees were served little cold, but it's nice, though it should be served hot. The cookies are awesome.  We asked for a check and the waiter ask for my card without presenting the bill.  He swipe my card and put the machine at the table and left. I have to do it by myself in removing the merchant copy as well as the card holder's copy.   My first experience and I'm not happy with the service.  But I would love to visit again."
"This year's trip was every bit as good as last year. Thank you for the upgrade to an executive suite which allowed us to enjoy complimentary high tea, cocktails and cognac in the palace lounge; that was a special treat. There is so much to love about this hotel but for me the stand-out features are the butler service, the heritage and ambiance of the palace wing, the superbly crafted flower displays, the incredibly comfortable beds, the views from the sea and palace lounges and the swimming pool area where you can really relax from the hustle and bustle of the city. The lamb chops served at the evening poolside barbecue were exceptional.  Unfortunately we did experience a problem when checking out the evening before our early morning departure which was not handled terribly well"
"The Taj Mahal Palace hotel is the finest hotel we have stayed at in our 20 years of traveling the world and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We were not sure weather this hotel would suit us as it is right in the heart of Mumbai and close to a great deal of tourist traffic, but it is such a smoothly run hotel we had no concerns."
"A truly amazing hotel with service second to none.  Why can't service look like this in America?  Stayed in Palace wing--the original building--and it is everything you would want from an historic hotel. The room was spacious with the Arabian Sea right outside our window.   The staff could not be more helpful, courteous,  kind, friendly.  I could go on and on.  Mumbai is a tough city to navigate and this hotel was truly an oasis with its beautiful pool and grounds and gorgeous interior.  Everyone was so wonderfully helpful... Glenn  especially was terrific in solving a small challenge for  us!  "
My wife Mrs khan had recently put up a ladies gathering at shamiana for the Saturday brunch and as coming from my wife and her friends and also from myself in personal I would like to forward a big thank you to Ms Nandini Choudhary and her staff at shamiana for making it very special for us and appreciate all the warm hospitality received. It was a real great experience
"In town on business and really appreciated the great location, awesome sense of history combined with all modern conveniences, great food, and impeccable service.  Tried the Sea Lounge, Harbor Bar, and Wasabi - good food in all and great view of the water and Gateway of India.  Pool was very relaxing, too."
"We arrived in Mumbai on the 3rd November and stayed at the Taj for 3 nights.      The first thing you notice on arrival is the Taj signature perfume that wafts its way through the hallways, entrances and outside areas.  We were booked into a Superior Sea view room in the new block but we were upgraded to a deluxe room in the old palace and I am glad we made this decision.   The hotel is stunning in its design and its art, every floor, corner and wall is adorned with art that even an art gallery would be envious of.  The welcome we received was genuinely warm from all the staff and our room was spacious, with a view of the pool area. A very large king size bed, iron , tea making facilities, TV and laundry service.  All the usual items you would expect in a hotel of this type.  "
"The Taj Mahal Palace hotel is one of the best hotels in the world. Having stayed with them for a week recently it was an amazing experience. The hotel is plush, and the staff go out of their way to ensure you have a wonderful time. Fortunate enough to stay in one of the luxuriously appointed Club Palace Suites, the butlers were brilliant and attended to every wish I had. They went beyond the call of duty to make sure you had everything you needed.  The Palace suites have their own beautiful garden and pool area which was breathtaking and tranquil.  On arrival to departure the staff were wonderful.  Having eaten in a few of the restaurants, I can highly recommend the Japanese, the Lebanese and the Chef's Table which was a unique experience - food served on Versace plates and our"
"We had high tea at the sea lounge. It starts at 15:30 until 18:30.   Bookings are not taken so it's walk in only.  Price is 2000prs per person including tax.   The high tea consists of a buffet including sandwiches, savoury food, street food and cakes, as well as delicious ice tea.   You would pay 3 times more in all don for high tea in a hotel of such category and don't get a buffet.   A highly recommended afternoon in a fabulous hotel. "
"Ever since watching the TV documentary about The Taj Palace Hotel, I wanted to visit it  to see if it was as good as the program suggested. In many ways, it was.  My arrival  was by taxi in the late morning. It was immediately apparent that there was strong security, with a full inspection of the vehicle between made before it entered the drop off area. My luggage was screened similarly to how it would be at the airport and I was asked to pass through a security scanner. This caused me to feel very safe indeed. A staff member took my bags and gave me a receipt tag.  My immediate impression was that I was visiting a good quality hotel. The main lobby was a careful combination of traditional and modern that contrasted well. As I moved into the Palace Wing a sense of opulence was"
"This is a lovely hotel.   A beautiful lobby and a warm welcome. Fresh flowers and an incredible smell on the ground floor. Nice pool area. Very helpful and knowledgable concierge.   Could offer very little advice with the current currency issues. It would have been useful for the situation to have been explained to us fully and suggestions given. After all they have a five star rating, which should seem them going above and beyond.   Our driver for the morning was a delight. It was like having our own tour guide. Very interesting updates and nice to hear about his family.   Do watch the difference in pricing for the same wines!!   "
Well worth a visit amazing staff food everything was fantastic I can understand why royalty stay there the rooms were beautiful I have never slept in such a comfortable bed and the pillows were just so soft nothing was to much trouble for the staff
"Unmatched experiance from the minute one Checks in Supported by a Team of experienced Butlers till the time of Check out you are made to feal like a Royal Visitor,whose ecevery need is taken care of From Food and Beverage to any shoping need that one may have,The Concierge Team is hand to take ccare of this aspect .House keeping will ensure that you are ine most clean and Hygenic surroundins."
This hotel offers one of the best locations in Mumbai and still has the charm of India but in the new modern wing you have the best in 5 star Mumbai can offer the older wing is a little sad but to see the gateway to India on the sea every morning is great I recommend afternoon tea here it's the best 
"If you want your stay to be the highlight of your trip then make sure you stay at the Taj in Mumbai. The staff are as amazing at the hotel, they couldn't do enough for you. And so close to some of the key sights of Mumbai."
We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in November 16. We had booked a tower room as we had got an amazing room rate so we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the Palace wing!!   The room was delightful with lots of old school luxury charm. All the amenities you could wish for were provided and I must say the housekeep/butler Vijay was outstanding. I left him a bit to say my hairbrush had broken and on my return from the day there it was all repaired.   We ate twice and the food is great although a little pricey for Mumbai but when you are staying at the Palace it is to be expected but well worth every penny.  Lots to see and do around the Gateway and South Mumbai so if you want and get a great deal don't hesitate to be treated like a Maharani
"This hotel has the best service that I have experienced anywhere in the world - it boarders on being excessive but as it is so graciously and humbly delivered, you could never resent it! The food, the decor, the location and value for money are all wonderful too. This is the only place I'd stay if I return to Bombay!"
"after a day of walking i wanted to get a drink in the bar, first i couldn't get a drink at the courtyard because i wasn't a resident, second we couldn't find the bar, third when i ordered signature drink & appetizer i was told that ingredients were not available, one plus roasted marshmallow seeds, were excellent"
"The ultimate experience of hotel hospitality equals to VIP,NO HOTEL IN MUMBAI AT PAR WITH HOTEL TAJ MAHAL. Food,Hospitality,Stay ALL BEST,at all departments. The Best Hotel,choosy customer can bank upon, keep it up !!!!"
Superb experience. It was a really great experience. It just made our day. The architecture is amazing and the overall feel is ROYAL. Truly an experience worth it. We would definitely recomment to all our friends.
"My wife and I stayed here for 3 days on our way back from Goa.When we checked in we were told we had our room upgraded,this was a very pleasant surprise.The room was spotless and of a decent size,with a big bathroom.With our upgrade came a host of complimentary items,which we used.1of these was a free cocktail hour,where they were just delicious.The staff were all magnificent and extremely helpful.The breakfast was in the palace lounge,with a view of the India gate.We also had afternoon tea,which was just gorgeous,with all the sandwiches and tea on offer.Once you have stayed here you can see why this is one of the best hotels in the world.Will definitely stay there again.Thank you to all the staff there."
The service in the hotel is incredable. The rooms are big and comfortable. The view on the gate to India. The restaurant is very nice andcthe food is so tastful that we want to come back especialy for it.
"We moved our accommodation from the SubaPalace, I won't go into the reasons for this you can read the review if you wish. The Taj is pure luxury and everything about this hotel is truly 5 star. All the staff are amazing even when the Money crisis hit India and we ran out of cash and had to use our bank cards to pay for everything resulting in the staff not getting tips. This did not phase the bell boys, the waiting staff or even the lift man. They continued to do there job with a smile regardless. We did try to make up for this by asking the hotel to distribute a gratuity we made by card at checkout time. I sincerely hope they did as it was their hard work that made our stay so enjoyable"
"Can't think of a hotel anywhere which can touch this place for amazing rooms, superbly finished and appointed without being ostentatious. It's an exciting hotel steeped in character and beauty, staff typical of high end Indian hotels can't do enough (club service very good). Spend the dosh and treat yourself to the best room / suite you can afford in the main hotel, you'll feel like royalty."
"I recently took a business trip with three people for their first ever visit to India. I booked us into the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, and it did not disappoint! We were fortunate to be upgraded to the heritage wing which greatly enhanced the experience. Wonderful rooms, classic decor and amazingly comfortable beds. Bathroom has all amenities required and the staff are truly exceptional.  Can't wait to return!"
"First stop on our India tour. Pretty shattered after the flight, so really good to have a top class hotel, with full facilities and great service.   Very comfortable rooms, very well appointed, and lots of ""extras"" included. Service staff were great and extremely helpful & attentive.  Absolutely no problems or complaints, but as we were only on B&B, we found the costs of meals and drinks in the hotel rather staggeringly expensive - and that's coming from someone (me) who is well used to London & New York prices!   An iconic, luxury hotel, situated next to the Gateway to India, which is a must see place to start your tour of India.   HGML"
"As always, The Taj doesn't fail to disappoint.   My wife and I had checked in for a night away from the stress of our regular day to day schedule and had an extremely relaxing and unforgettable stay.   Staff was extremely courteous and upgraded our room knowing that we were pregnant and expecting our first child. Not only that, they had a Cake (not pastries, an entire cake) delivered to our room to congratulate us. The final icing on the cake was when they managed to fetch figs for my pregnant wife during breakfast even though they were not served in the breakfast buffet. Mind you, the breakfast buffet had atleast 7 different types of fruits already and this was a special unusual request that they attended to.   Overall, I would highly recommend the ""Taj Experience"" to everyone"
"This is not only a fine luxury hotel, but a landmark as well. Next to the India gate, it is easily accessed by public transit  cabs etc. The security around the hotel is 24/7 after the terrorist attacks of a few years ago. The food is exceptional, and the central courtyard is a quit oasis to eat, read, or talk."
"we wanted to go to the spa but unfortunately it s only for hotel customers... so we asked if they coud recoment an other place. the Taj Mahal concierge recommended us an (appartently ) great place gave us address location on a map and phone of this great Ayurvedic massage place. we went there and supprise there was nothing there, we call th number the concierge gave us and unexisting phone number, we asked all the local shops and nobody ever heard about this place. After wasting 1 hour looking for this SPA, we looked up on internet and discovered ant the SPA existed but they gae us a fake addresse ( 50km of difference) and fake phone number..... so thank you dear concierge for this POOR service, next time better say nothing than to give meaningly false information...."
"It could be argued that this is India's most iconic hotel.  We stayed as part of an organised tour so cannot comment on the room rate or value for money.  Our room was in the new wing overlooking The Gateway to India.  As you would expect the room was clean and comfortable and the staff attentive.  Too many staff in the cafe though, almost falling over each other to serve.  Food and drinks were pricey as one would expect.  A lovely pool area to enjoy away from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai."
The staff at the Taj were always so friendly and accommodating.  The room was always well cared for (above my expectations).  I happened to fall ill upon my arrival and the genuine concern and care I received put my mind at ease.  There is a Starbucks just behind the Taj as well.
"My husband and I stayed two nights at the Taj Mahal Palace as one of a few splurge nights on our three and a half week tour of India. We were not disappointed! We were a little disappointed when we were told that the ocean view room we had booked was not available as a non smoking room so we could either have a smoking room or an upgrade to the palace. Being India we were a little skeptical and accompanied the desk clerk on a tour of both rooms. We weren't really that attached to an ocean view room especially a smoky one and the palace room was such a clear upgrade that we accepted it. Then we were able to stay and relax in the room while the desk clerk checked us in using his laptop in the room. The room was spacious, very upscale and luxurious. We couldn't believe how all of"
"From the moment we pulled into the hotel we were treated like royalty. The entrance is extremely grand and very chilled atmosphere. There is of course security on the gate who check every car throughly on entrance.   We had a room in the old building over looking the gateway to India. It was on the side and we had no problems with any noise, very quiet on floor 3.   The room was massive, huge comfortable bed, desk, minibar, large closet with dressing gown and safe.   The marble bathroom was stunning, large bath, shower, sink, hair dryer and all amenities needed.   The swimming pool was perfect to chill by after a mad day in the city. It was very quiet, netting to keep birds away, attentive staff putting out pool towels and taking drinks orders.   The spa was beautiful and very"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a beautiful and majestic palace hotel of unique architecture and interiors. The adjacent tower, that is part of the complex, built in the 1970's should be seen as an annex with extra rooms and allows an slightly more affordable stay. I would definitely recommend you to stay at the Palace as the way into your room thru the amazing corridors and stairs and the room itself are an important part of the experience. The actual number of rooms (more than 500) and the numerous dinning venues and shops that attract many Mumbaikar's turn the lobby and most of the ground floor into a crowded area.  The dinning venues are sophisticated and cosmopolitan and the food is generally good. The outdoor terrace and swimming pool are very nice but the space is quite limited."
"If there is a hotel on this earth with finer service, we have yet to encounter it! The sheer number of staff may have something to do with it, but they are polite, friendly and helpful to a fault, as well as being impressively trained. On chatting to them, you invariably discover an intense loyalty to the establishment - ten, twenty and even thirty years service seems almost to be the norm. Multiple choices of restaurants mean you don't even need to venture outside, and we had delicious meals at the main coffee shop (Shamiana), the Chinese (Golden Dragon) and the Middle Eastern (Souk). Breakfast in the Shamiana is buffet-style, and with an excellent range of choices (cooked items, teas and coffees are brought to your table). The pool is excellently maintained, and has a pleasant"
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Taj Mahal Palace, from a personalized check-in to a seamless check-out and everything in between.......all was near perfect.  The staff throughout the hotel was always friendly, smiling and caring, whether in the restaurants, at the front desk, housekeeping staff and butlers in the Palace wing.  The room was comfortable and well appointed.  I couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable experience."
The Taj Mahal building is spectacular and the rooms are fabulous. We stayed in the historic wing - it really is worth the extra to experience the beautiful building. You really feel that you travel back in time! We had breakfast at 7am as the sun was rising over the bay - a superb view and great for photos. The staff were amazing throughout the hotel - everyone is just so genuine and so proud to be part of the hotel staff. A fabulous experience. 
"Stayed 2 nights in November while attending our company seminar in the Crystal Ballroom. The food in the restaurants were excellent, staff in the hotel were very friendly and attended to all needs on the spot especially when you are on business. Having all day dining is very convenient especially when you have to meet people at the last minute!! I was in a room on the 3rd floor facing the sea and harbour next to the monument Gateway of India, Mumbai. I also liked the architecture, the hotel has an important history founded by the Tata family. Will definitely go back on a future visit "
"What a place!!! On arrival to departure you feel like royalty, staff amazing, architecture amazing!! Was upgraded from the tower to the palace wing,was very happy. If there is one hotel you should visit before you die! It's the tajnerd_face"
"There is no place like the Taj for hospitality. They are losing their edge in terms of being able to solve problems instantaneously and the communication skills of the more recent recruits leaves a lot to be desired. All this aside, a really good experience. Wish they had more range in terms of their food options. Way to overpriced for the food offerings."
"Room excellent, bed very comfortable, room well equipped, great views from palace wing room - dining options also very good.  Drinks a little pricey and would have appreciated some more nibbles at the drinks table.  Quality of food in patisserie was below my expectations and prices way too high."
Stayed here for one night and must say the service was above excellence..from the moment we arrived we was able to check in six hours early than the usual check in time which was much appreciated..the room had been decorated with rose petals and flowers along with balloons for my early birthday!! And when we returned back after sight seeing there was a delicious chocolate cake waiting!! Thank you for your wonderful hospitality.  Our room had a magnificent view of the Gateway and exceeded my expectations...every member of the hotel team made us feel extra special..would really love to stay longer..a peaceful haven in this wonderful vibrant city....
Extremely courteous staff carrying forward the traditional Taj hospitality ! Very well maintained rooms with all required amenities. Got a sense of history walking around this heritage hotel. Looking forward to another stay !!
"This is one place where the word "" NO "" does not exist for hotel guests. We are firm patrons of Taj Mahal Palace and had the most super time during our stay here.  We recommend this place for all. We were overwhelmed by the care and attention showered on us and hope it shall continue for all."
"I just loved my stay there, and I am a difficult Guest as I travel a lot and I am a member of the Leaders Club (LHW) Only one detail is out of line: the price of the Car transfer, whihc is 10times the price of a Uber to go to the airport, so the company which works for the hotel is really out of market, so I took a Uber when i left, to go to the airport..."
"It's a landmark. The pride of India. It has a history, an interesting one to say the least. We had a real good dinner party here, but i was not overly impressed with food or staff. Perhaps if i would have worn a Rolex it would have made more of an impression. Fancy stores inside and beautiful interior. Also, the location is nice across the Gateway To India and close to Marine Drive. You should go, just to have been, but i would not stay here. Plenty of great hotels in the area for a much friendlier price."
"This hotel is probably the best hotel I stayed for the last 30 years ! the organisation and service by  the staff is extremely good. This is en experience you may not miss when traveling to Bombay...5 star luxe in ""old world"". We had a minor problem with our room the first night and we were immediately upgraded ! Expensive but worthwile,we will go back"
"Feel proud of having this 5 star hotel in our city.  The hotel is located right next to Gate way of India and the sea  The hotel has two wings - Tower wing (new part of the hotel) and Palace wing (the earlier part of the hotel). We were lucky to stay in the palace wing of the hotel  They have a 45 min trip of the hotel every evening, where they tell us about the Taj Culture. It was very informative and worth attending the trip. No charges for the trip  Pool side restaurant is good. They have 2-3 restaurants where you can have food. Food is costly there!  Breakfast is lavish at Shamiyana  Hotel ambience is great, and we got rooms which had view of the Gateway from the balcony.  Our stay was great and would like to visit Taj more often"
"This is one of the most beautiful and historic hotels in the world. The suite we had was beautifullly and tastefully furnished, the marble bathroom was gorgeous and had every amenity you could want. The extras in the suite included a jar of fabulous cookies, different kinds of nuts, fruits, coffee and tea and a bottle of red wine. Everything was replenished daily. Additionally, a butler was at our disposal as well as free use of the palace club where one could have afternoon tea, coktails and cognac in the evening. The breakfast was excellent, located in a beautiful venue overlooking the Gate of India and the sea. The service was very attentive, perhaps the best we have experienced in all our numerous travels. The location could not be more central or picturesque. The food in"
"This hotel lived up to everything I had expected and more. From the moment we stepped out of the airport and was meet by the chauffeur and a representative from the Taj who checked our booking we were being treated as VIP's. On arrival at the hotel we was taken straight to our room and was informed that they had been upgraded us to one of their luscious suites, it was fabulous with a view to the sea and India Gate Monument. The service was outstanding by all the staff who always greeted you no matter where you was in the hotel and was willing to help you. Food was outstanding and you had a choice of restaurant's, afternoon tea was a real treat especially the Maharaja's High Tea (this is a must do experience). Indian hospitality is one of the best we have enjoyed and the Taj is"
"This hotel is fabulous, I had a very decadent and unique experience staying here. The staff are the most efficient and proud to serve that I have come across in any hotel. The rooms had everything you need to make the stay comfortable. The toiletries and drinking water were stocked up throughout the day. The restaurant food in the evening was delicious but a little on the steep side."
"This is absolutely my favourite hotel in the world. It's beautiful, luxurious and decadent. The staff are wonderfully trained and are attentive without being over-bearing.  The rooms are beautiful and the butlers offer a great service. The pool area is amazing and the pool attendants are fantastic bringing cold water and fruit regularly.   The breakfast in the sea lounge is my favourite and particularly good if you get a table at the window over looking the Gateway of India. The multiple restaurants are all fantastic too. We got a great offer this time and it wasn't too expensive either. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Bombay."
"We visited the Taj for 3 nights as an anniversary treat for part of our tour of India. From the moment we walked through the doors to their signature perfume to the moment we left it was sheer heaven.  Our room was in the old palace overlooking the pool.  A large king size bed, bathroom with bath and a small reception area. It had a mini safe, hairdryer, minibar,TV and iron/ board.  On the morning of our anniversary we came back to our room from breakfast and they had laid petals on our marble floor, roses on my desk in a heart shape and our room was full of heart shaped balloons. Lovely small gifts appeared each day with small notes and bags of herbs for the bath. Thoughtful things as part of the service. Our room was cleaned every time we left the room. Nothing was too much"
"The problem with security is that it makes you feel like you have arrived at an international airport,  and this is the case on arriving at the Taj. However the difference in arriving at the Taj is that intense security is done with a smile and a charm.  And once inside theTaj you are immediately transported in to a world a million miles from the outside world."
Probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. We were upgraded to a heritage suite in the original building. Steeped in history this is a truly luxurious hotel in a wonderful location with exceptional service to match.
"One of the world's great hotel experiences from arrival to breakfast to high tea to swimming to cognac and chocolates to departure. Great service, amazing art collection, lovely location, nice restaurants. Could we just move here?"
"As part of our jaunt to Mumbai, girlie and I went for tea at this iconic venue.  Beautiful place. Awesome location.  We asked where we could enjoy some tea and snacks; as we were not guests on this occasion but just wanted to hang out somewhere nice.  A lovely lady pointed us to the Sea Lounge on the first floor.  Off we went.  Yes some of the light bulbs were out... yes in places the paint was peeling.... carpet frayed.. but you know what? The staff made this excursion so delightful, it didn't matter.   To be totally objective; There was one lady staff person who clomped about annoyingly with her clumpy shoes... and had a face like a wet fish the whole time.. she stuck out like a sore thumb compared to everyone else there, but she was in the minority.   The food was delicious."
"This place is a piece is history , the hallways to art rooms. The grand staircase to chic restaurants. We stayed at the palace rooms,  amazing service the quality of stuff in the hotel is amazing. It's a luxury star all the way"
"Of course it's great. You pay for it of course, but it's fabulous. We did reject the first couple of bedrooms because of a musty smell, but they bent over backwards to help. The whole place is a calm respite from the madness and heat of outside, so I can only recommend it. "
You can feel the history from the moment you step through the entrance. The friendliness of all of the staff in whatever position is apparent at every turn.  We stayed in a room overlooking the pool  and garden. We were only staying for one night on our way from one Taj hotel in Dubai to another Taj hotel in GOA. This didn't stop us from enjoying afternoon tea - which was delicious - and a wonderful meal at the Golden Dragon restaurant - which was superb. All in all this is a truly wonderful place worthy of its famous reputation and I'm looking forward to coming back in a weeks time
"We only went  to the bar for drinks but the minute we arrived, we realized we should have stayed here. The location, the pool and the lobby which are the factors that we were able to assess were perfect. The architecture and the history of the hotel are unparalleled. "
We were there basically to experience our stay in this iconic hotel and boy...we were delighted and touched with the kind of service and care all the staff showed to us . Excellent breakfast and lovely lounges to have some drinks and bites. We left taking this as a memory ....holiday in our own city as we live in Mumbai ...
My son and I stayed in a Palace suite for 4 nights and then I stayed on in a Palace room for 2. Facilities were marvellous! Great pool..fine gym. The service in all of the hotel facilities was excellent. The Taj Palace would be In the top three hotels I have ever stayed at.
The hotel was simply the best hotel we have ever stayed in. We'll worth paying a bit extremely for breakfast and sea view. The staff were super friendly without being in your face. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Security  was very high but that was expected  and reassuring. 
"I stopped here for an overnight on my way to Pune, this is one of the most impressive hotels in the world.  I  would recommend taking breakfast out on the lawn (watch out for the Ravens). Difficult to imagine the peace and tranquility yet over the wallis mayhem.  This Hotel instantly makes you feel special."
We were greeted warmly and taken to our room -it seemed that they just couldn't do enough for us.  It was exceptionally clean with well appointed furniture and coverings.  The staff were so kind and helpful.  We had a good breakfast each day with lots of variety and had some relaxing times around the pool.  I would highly recommend this hotel.
"Great hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. Fantastic view from our room..... The Gateway to India!!! Food was delicious. Great location near lots of bars and restaurants. Recommend this hotel to everyone... Families, couples or people visiting on business. Best hotel in this part of India x"
Ambiance -- fantastic. Service - the very best. Staff - extremely attentive. Food -- try the street food in the Sea Lounge - delicious.  This is the best hotel in Mumbai and a great place to finish your India visit.  Cant think of anything negative to say  -- although it may be a little expensive for some but is well worth the little extra that it costs.
My boyfriend and I had a great experience from the very first minute at this fantastic hotel. We were welcomed with a complimentary drink and small traditional gifts. We stayed in a lovely room with a comfortable bed and a very luxury bathroom (with a tv in the mirror) that we really loved :) The staff introduced us to our room and took care of us; offering a foot massage as we mentioned that we were very tired after long trip from Dubai. Thank you for everything!
"I had been emailing Mr Ramneet Singh for 4 New Zealanders to have High Tea at the Taj. Mr Singh was not available on the day of our visit so arranged for Mr Pradeep to look after us, however he was sick on this day and did not inform any of his staff in the restaurant. We were looked after by Sophia who was absolutely fantastic, Sophia could not do enough for us, well done Sophia. It is amazing that most other places High Tea is served at your table and not a buffet late lunch or early dinner. The Taj had an amazing documentary made by the BBC on how outstanding the Taj was, and I would have to agree, it was a fantastic documentary on the building, staff and food. However, our first hand impression was not so. Our coffee saucer was chipped and the appalling dress code was"
"Every time I walked into my room I found a new sweet gesture from the housekeepers, like a rose clay mask layed on the table, or a foot spa bowl on the floor. Sometimes it would be as simple as a bookmark on top of my book, or an accessory to keep my phone charger for tangling. It was very thoughtful.  Most of my meals were at the hotel. There were multiple gluten free options in all their restaurants, some even served bread too.   The hotel buffet had a variety of bread choices because Indians tend to use rice flour a lot more than wheat.  In addition, when I got a cold and felt feverish in the last few days there, the buffet staff made me different drinks and soups to help with the cold and sour throat. More thoughtfulness."
"Beautiful  hotel. Well run by friendly and helpful bilingual staff. Roooms are very large , comfortable and accommodating with many amenities.   The hotel has many restaurants to choose from. Sea Lounge has a beautiful breakfast buffet.  Shamiana has very eclectic menu. Both were helpful in accommodating a gluten-free diner."
"From the minute you step into the grounds of this hotel, you know you have left the bustle of Bombay and have entered a time capsule of colonial grandeur, ultimate elegance and historical significance. Sitting by the pool and staring at the brick structures it is sometimes hard to imagine what a different world lies just on the other side. We stayed in the Palace, where the structure itself is magnificent in the style of the images one carries in mind of the British Empire in faraway lands. We occupied one of the hotel's few suites and were regaled with impressive historical touchstones such as the stairs Gandhi walked up to negotiate the independence of India... Outside our window, the Magnificent Gateway to India from where Gandhi himself waived off the departing British after"
"Taj Mahal Mumbai doesn't require recommendations - it is a legendary place in a legendary Colaba district, place with a long and rich history. However, its important, that it is young and energetic till now: excellent and attentive service, great rooms and public feeling condition, nice restaurants. And, of course, excellent views and location.  Just indulge yourself and enjoy the stay in historical wing, - its not just a place to sleep, but an essential part of the real Indian voyage. Suites are excellent."
The staff were lovely and the environment luxurious but though the food was very good the wine was expensive and then the taxes. These hocked up the cost of everything and were a feature of most restaurants. Sometimes as many 4 different ones.
"My wife and I checked in to the Taj,  we were paying a fairly hefty sum to stay in the old part of the hotel- avoid the tower block, its just not the same. At check in the clerk tried to sell us a room upgrade. I was pretty flabbergasted if I'm honest, I have never experienced this before, certainly not from a hotel of this ilk. I declined their kind offer, we were promptly shown to what must be the worst room in the hotel. You know the one, half opaque windows looking out onto a flat roof with workmen on it. We declined this also. We said we'd wait by the pool and have a drink whilst this was sorted. It should be noted that a complimentary drink was not offered, which was poor IMHO. After a few minutes we were told that everything was sorted, and I should go to reception to"
"I visited several places in India recently, this was definitely the highlight of all.  The location and waterfront views, the attention to detail, courtesy and beautifully appointed interior exudes history and tradition.  I would stay here again any time."
"Fantastic building (old aisle) , top service, Very good breakfast. The SPA is not at the Palace standard. I warmly suggest to book the Palace car for Airport Pick-up. Few very good restaurants a working distance. Don't miss the Palace tour every day at 5pm, you will learn that the front side of the Palace had been build up at the wrong side (pool  side instead of see side) this is why you have no entrance from the road..."
"Great location opposite the gateway to India, full of history and many fantastic stories of guest before you. Presidents, countless film starts and royality have all stayed during its history which makes you feel just a little bit special. Staff, services, food and some impressive in house shopping can't fail to impress. It blends the beauty of Colonial India with the modern vibrant country it is today. A must stay when in Mumbai or Bombay depending on your age."
"A lovely warm greeting again but this time in a very busy commonplace hotel lobby. We were shown to our room which smelt very musty, I appreciate this is another old converted palace but this was unacceptable so we asked to change rooms, and were given another which although still musty wasn't so bad.  The bathrooms are luxuriously appointed with lovely marble, but our bath area was stained by rust coming through the marble from (probably) leaking copper pipes. The next morning we were asked if our room was better now but told the duty manager about the problems, and he immediately took it upon himself to change our room again, this time to a club level room which though smaller smelt fresh. I have mixed feelings about this property, the public rooms & pool area are fantastic,"
"This iconic hotel lives up to every expectation. It's just spot on in every way.  An exercise in how a hotel should be run.  Attentive, understated formality that feels comfortable rather than overbearing.  This visit to India was in part to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary.  No attention to detail was spared with our room being decorated with balloons when we arrived, drinks sent up within minutes, followed by a stunning cake and upon return to our room later that night, an anniversary card and chocolates. Pool area was so relaxing.  Hotel in a great location, with great bars and restaurants in easy walking distance.  We felt totally safe walking around, even late at night.  Am expensive but worthwhile treat."
"The best service ever. Detailed oriented, caring, eager to please,  accommodating any need. beautiful Hotel, so well decorated, and great location too. Breakfast and dining areas were also great, just beware of the expensive shops :-)"
"The taj is such an amazing place and it is worth getting a tour. Advise: if you have rented a private driver like us, DO NOT get the recommended tour guide as the price is double that usual!! Go to the taj and haggle with tour guides for the cheapest price! Tell them a set price and if they don't take it start to walk away. They will come running to you as they know that you are not stupid.   The prices are set such as the 1000 rupies to get in but everything else can be haggled down!   Also they will tell you that you have 1k walk to the taj so they do there best to get you on a carriage...I suggest not because the horse is half dead...it's not good and it's not nice...the walk is around 0.5k which will take you 20 mins and it's very very nice  "
"Following a recommendation as the place to stay in Mumbai we were really looking forward to our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace. Our expectations were massively surpassed. The service we received and the facilities were second to none. The hotel is right next to the Gateway to India, and perfectly situated to explore Mumbai. We usually spend little time in any hotel when visiting a city, but this was the exception - it was a wrench to leave the hotel, despite the many attractions of Mumbai. The food is excellent - there are many eating options, though high tea followed by cocktails with snacks doesn't leave much room for a meal. Would definitely return if in Mumbai, and highly recommend to anyone."
"The Taj is a 5 star hotel and it shows. Easily the best I have ever stayed in and shows that history,charm and service outdoes flash and lack of substance such as those 5/6 star hotels in Dubai, or the Oberoi nearby - new, but style over substance. The staff were excellent, the facilities superb. Nothing was a problem for the staff who were friendly and helpful throughout. The view was fantastic and location superb to see the best of Mumbai. cannot recommend highly enough"
"We had a suite on the fourth floor and the children had rooms next to us. You can't fail to be impressed by the Taj; it's incredibly iconic and beautiful. The accessibility to the Gateway to India was perfect and beautiful at sunrise IF you can wake up from that stunningly comfortable bed.  Our children loved the swimming pool area and how friendly the staff were. At times the sheer magnitude of the hotel blew us away but what an experience! Highly recommended. As with all things in India, I struggled with the concept of staying in such a lush hotel when there were beggars with babies around the corner. And there are! Be prepared and we did have the Taj guide Shakil take us all on a city tour (lasting roughly 4 hours) the next day. He was incredibly informative, took us to the"
The hotel has excellent hospitality and staff but highly disappointed with my room positioning. I was upgraded without being informed to taj palace heritage wing wherein the room positioning was disappointing with no access to windows and no view absolutely.   Highly Disappointed!
Absolutely fantastic experience. Stayed in the Palace wing again and it was exceptional. The atmosphere throughout the whole hotel is totally unique and second to none.  You really feel you have arrived in a destination from start to finish.
"We stayed in the old palace and were fortunate to be upgraded to an executive suite. The room was superb - as was the butler service that came with it - serving tea in the room and making restaurant reservations for us.  The building - especially the staircase is amazing. Its good to go on the Heritage Tour if you get the chance to learn more about the interesting history and really appreciate the hotel.   Highlights for us of our stay - the serene light ceremony each evening, drinks by the pool before dinner, early morning swims in the pool, wonderful breakfasts, the little bookmarks left in magasines and books by the housekeepers as well as the little fabric wipes left near phones, tablets and specs cases. Very thoughtful touches that made us feel special guests. Will"
"The service is second to none without a doubt and most certainly the best I have experienced anywhere in India, in fact anywhere!  The staff go out of their way to make your experience a wonderful one.  It's the individual, personalised special touches that make all the difference.  The rooms are luxurious within the  traditional style that is the Taj.  All the restaurants serve beautiful cuisine - all the highest standard."
The Taj mahal palace is not just a hotel but a  landmark. It was in my checklist for a long time. It didn't disappoint. The hotel facilities are world class and the hospitality from everyone makes you feel special.  Pro TIP: book the hotel from the Taj inner circle site and by other mediums like makemytrip. It is same price but in addition you get inner circle points.
The taj mahal is the best hotel in India and all the staff member of taj behavior are friendly and I am happy and enjoying taj mahal palace and also food are very good and tajmahal location is very good position 
"Amazing, superb customer service, attention to detail, food... and decor.  Worth every penny. The suites are particularly luxurious - we wanted for nothing.  The breakfast view was stunning - overlooking india gate."
We stayed at this hotel in oct 2016. It was a family of two adults and two girls  We were in the main building and the rooms were very nice. The building has a lovely balance of the old feature with modern touches.  We had come to India after a long time and it was our anniversary. They made it very special for us.  The staff are well trained and level of service provided here is outstanding.  We didn't try much of the food here so cant comment but the breakfast was really nice.  Overall one of the best hotels we have stayed in. Thank you all at taj  Pritesh 
"There's not much that can be said about this wonderful hotel that hasn't been told.   King's and queens, heads of state and the worlds most rich and famous have enjoyed the Taj Palace experience and as a normal London couple we once again were treated as everyone who comes here is, as a unique VIP.   The staff are awesome, never overbearing yet always there. The Palace rooms are beautiful and so well equipped you'll wish you lived here, which incidentally some incredibly fortunate magnates do.   Food is sumptuous, if a little pricey as you would expect at one of the worlds great hotels but you are within a short walk to everyday priced restaurants with good food also.   The pool area is a great relaxing experience and breakfast is a must with a huge variety set in the awesome"
"very good location without polluted area peaceful, good for any party or ceremony, for enjoy and cheerful place, all supermarket are very closed to the location, no cheating no fraud, every body can feel peaceful enjoy and great time pass"
"If your budget permits it, don't even think twice and stay in this hotel. Try booking a room in the palace wing over the tower wing. It's the older building with larger rooms and higher ceilings etc. The restaurants in the hotel are all fabulous - especially Souk (Lebanese) The pool is also lovely. Prime location for tourists in the city."
This is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in. It is a gorgeous hotel with the friendliest and kindest staff I have ever experienced. We had our 8 month old baby with us and the level of attention and warmth she received was amazing. I would highly recommend staying here...
We stayed for three nights in the old part of the hotel and enjoyed the benefits of a club room. The decor and the building is simply stunning. There is a great attention to detail both in maintaining the quality of the property but also in guest service. Nothing was too much trouble and it was important to the hotel that we enjoyed our stay. They were most helpful with all our requirements to ensure a comfortable and happy stay. We also took the daily tour of the hotel available to guests and we learnt a great deal about the history of the building to the modern day. It was a fascinating insight into this iconic hotel. We ate dinner in the hotel three times and enjoyed every meal. It was a most memorable stay and it was also our silver wedding anniversary and we were treated to
"Superb hotel, please go there once. I enjoy in this hotel so much. All services are also very Good. I definitely go on this hotel again when I will go Mumbai. Don't miss this chance this hotel is very good"
"We stayed here as part of a tour of India to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The stay was superb. We were very well looked after and the staff made us feel so welcome and gave us some very special memories to take away with us.  We have to say a very special thank you to Natasha who organised flowers, drinks, balloons, cakes, gifts and cards for our arrival. The hotel is beautiful, the food exquisite and the service exceptional. We will certainly be coming back to this incredible hotel."
"Despite having an unhappy history and resulting in much heightened security, once inside you would not feel that and this hotel has a nice colonial feel, balancing the tradition with comfort and convenience. The room is spacious and clean, the bed comfortable. There is also a big pool for a swim, as well as a number of restaurants. I have tasted the Indian one (Masala Kraft) and the poolside BBQ. The food is decently good (but not to a level that I would call impressive)."
"Please visit THE TAJ, it is India's bast hotel's in one. It is also a 5 star hotel with all categories, I also say that if you visit the hotel /restaurant then you also visit many more time. So, please visit the place. "
"We were fortunate enough to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace on our recent visit to Mumbai.  They provide simply the finest service and accommodations we have ever experienced. We arrived around 3:00am.  Even at that early hour, we were greeted warmly and escorted through the hotel to registration and ultimately to our room where we where introduced to our butler and made familiar with the accommodations.  We used the concierge service extensively.  A special thank you to Sandeep who arranged a city tour, talked us through a visit to Elephanta Caves (insist on getting the UNESCO tour guide - it's free) and even set up my cell phone with a local SIM card.  We tried several of the restaurants on site and all were excellent."
"Although we only stayed one night in a whirlwind trip to Mumbai this place managed to live up to all expectations and then exceeded them. The service is on another level, the smell of jasmine is everywhere and all the spaces are filled with fresh flowers. Great food (although not the cheapest). They were so helpful on our last day storing luggage, organising cars and offering us a place to shower and refresh after a day in the city before our night train. Once in a lifetime and definitely worth it! "
We switched to the Taj at the last moment when visiting Mumbai and what a brilliant choice. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left the staff were fantastic. This is a beautiful and historic hotel in a great location. The facilities were excellent and we could not have been happier.
Due to the iconic status of this hotel I chose this over and above The Oberoi or JW Marriott - and so so glad I did.   I don't care much for old world hotels but this stay was just out of this world.   From the moment I walked into the hotel to the time I left I was looked after like a true Royal.   The check in staff were efficient and quick. They walked us to our rooms and provided information as we walked.   Every member of staff we came across always stopped for a short greeting.   The service was the very best I have ever experienced from any hotel including premium 5* hotels (even in the U.K.)  The room was perfect. Each room in the palace wing is slightly different. Attention to detail is amazing.   I left my sunglasses out and on returning in the evening they were placed
"The hotel exceeded all my expectations, other 5 star hotels in Mumbai are just no comparison, I checked out several as I was a bit reluctant to part with their rather high rates at the end of my 3 month Indian sojourn but I have no regrets and would not have missed it for the world.  The ambiance of the Palace Wing, Club floor with it's complimentary afternoon tea, cocktails and evening nightcap made me feel like royalty. After the rigours of mid range Indian travel I wanted a final three days of luxury relaxing around a perfect pool and that's what it was. It's a "" must do"" if you can."
Amazing location excellent service starting from the airport to our room the staff is very polite and is always ready to go that extra mile . Restaurant is clean and there is a lot to choose from again the staff is amazing. 
"Having lived in Mumbai for 15 years, coming back to the city on work has always been bitter-sweet. But staying at the Taj Mahal does something magical. The property itself is a visual treat and is a major landmark witha  great location (read: view too). The service is immaculate and the FnB options are top bracket.  For those of you who do not know the backstory, the team at Taj Mahal is also deeply inspring with their story of fortitude and ownership post some unfortunate events Mumabi faced few years back. There is a story there, of human spirit. And when you walk through the property and get smiles from the staff, you can feel it comes from a very very personal space."
"What a refreshing change to stay at a hotel of such heritage, style and quality. Lots of luxury hotels out there, but they may all have there modern wow, but after that they are sterile. Taj is just pedigree and in a class of it's own. Highly recommend this hotel when staying in Mumbai, it will certainly be my go to when visiting the city. I am now keen to explore the Taj experience in their other hotels and  this hotel has made it in to my all time top 5 hotels in the world."
"This was a perfect hotel experience. Perfect service, beautiful interiors and delicious food. The friendliest, most professional staff. They kept a gift for our daughter in the room and she was overjoyed. Thank you Mr Hussain.  Do not miss the hotel tour that starts 5 pm every day. Also as an Indian it feels us with pride and sorrow for the staffs who laid down their lives while saving the guests on 26/11 terror attack. The breakfast with views of Gateway of India and the sea will stay with us. This is also located very conveniently within walking distance of major Mumbai attractions.  We would return to Mumbai just to visit this beautiful hotel again. We loved every second of our stay here. "
"I was fortunate enough to stay in a room on the palace wing for 2 nights during a tour of India with my sister. I have traveled quite a bit in the last few years and this has to be the nicest hotel I have stayed in. From the minute we arrived we were treated with such warmth and friendliness, it made it a pleasure to be there. The staff are just fantastic, and really set this place apart.  The beds were so comfortable you just sink into them, and the bathroom was amazing, from the rain forest shower to the huge bathtub where you can watch a television on a mirror opposite.   Had breakfast in the Sea Lounge both mornings and it was fantastic. So much to choose from, the spread and variety was excellent. View from here is spectacular overlooking the ocean and the famous 'Gateway"
"We visited India for 3 weeks and stayed at over 10 different hotels and of all the hotels we stayed in, this was by far our best experience.  The hospitality here is unreal and you will NOT be disappointed!!!!  Their pick up service from the airport is extremely professional, they have butlers for each floor for if you need anything during your stay, they have THE BEST sushi restaurant which they fly in every 2nd day from Japan and the pool is spectacular :)"
"Hi,  The hotel (and the service) is great, no doubt in that.   However, the reason why I will never come back to this hotel is because of the following:   I booked the hotel for October 21st (one night). Your check in policy is 2PM. I arrived at 5 AM in the morning and asked at the concierge if I can enter my room now. They manager said yes, but only if I pay the full price for another night (October 20th), which is non-sense. When I complained, he offered me to pay 50% of the price, but that I can only enter my room at 6AM (which meant that I had to wait 1.5 more hours in the lobby after a long trip I had). Even though I do understand that this is the hotel policy, but what I was shocked about is that the Manager did not even try to meet me half way, and letting me at least 1.5"
"Outstandingly courteous staff, lovely surroundings, convenient location and wonderful food make for a truly fine experience. We spent the last couple of days of our trip at this hotel and it was the best accommodation I stayed in while in India. In particular I enjoyed the Sea Lounge (wonderful staff there and nice breakfast choices). We were in the palace wing, but I'm certain every room is well appointed. Shopping is right downstairs too, it's enjoyable just to walk around this hotel.   In short, if I ever end up in India again I will definitely make a point of staying at this hotel. And the Taj brand is something I recognize now.  Only one minor negative point: the ""butler"" assigned to you when you check in is a little overly helpful when standing in the middle of the bedroom"
I had a great experience during my recent stay at Taj Mahal and Palace Hotel in Mumbai. I had a room in the heritage wing that was out of this world. The old world atmosphere was enchanting and topped with excellent service. Breakfast in the Sea Lounge was tops with an unmatched variety of food and attentive service. One must add the stay at this hotel to the list of 10 things to do.
"We had a wonderful 2 days at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai and also 4 days at the Taj Vivanta in Cuffe Parade, Mumbai. Overall a very enjoyable luxury experience never to be forgotten! The hotels cater for almost every need and the staff are just fantastic in every way possible."
"I visit Sea Lounge at the Taj Mahal Palace once in a while for High Tea. It is always a great experience, with an array of sumptuous snacks and teas at offer, an a spectacular view of the sea. You can relax, chat and have a good time while being served all the goodies. On my last visit, I took my parents along. They completely enjoyed the experience. A special mention and thanks to ANSELM, who took good care of us. He is a pro in clicking photographs and delightedly clicked some good memories for us. On getting to know that it was also my Mom's birthday, he surprised us with some nice complimentary pastry. Always love to go back to this place."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a serene place to stay in a bustling ,hectic city. The staff and facilities are exceptional and the price is true value for money. On return to Mumbai I would not stay anywhere else. The hotel is exceptional."
Fantastic & Relax Stay : Very first an arrangement did which was complementary at TAJ PALACE for my parents who are sr. citizens and came for 75th b'day celebration. They were too happy with the welcome at reception. They were happy with comfort accommodation with arebian sea  view from their room window. Delighted with surprise with room decor with balloons & b'day cake arranged in their absence. Further words are falling short to express entire experience along with next day full stomach breakfast was too excellent. Many Many Thanks Taj.
I went for a walk to Gateway of India in Mumbai and I found this jewel. The afternoon tea in this old colonial hotel is excellent!. I fell in love of the atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and the service is impeccable. Can' wait to stay there in my next visit!
"I was fortunate to spend 4 nights at this fine hotel staying in a room in the Palace Wing overlooking Fort Gate. A beautiful hotel with lots of facilities but what sets it apart from so many hotels is the very high calibre of the staff. From the pick up at the airport, reception, butler, restaurant staff, cleaners, security and many more they really are very professional. They also sort things out very quickly if minor things go wrong, it was most impressive. I have stayed in many five star hotels around the world, The Taj Mahal Palace really is one of the best."
"Stopped for 5 nights in a club room , it's a beautiful hotel with excellent staff , food was lovely and always got sunbeds around the pool , done the hotel tour which was very interesting, But be prepared if you go outside for a walk , We got none stop hassle when we had a walk around the Gateway to India ."

"the service is just over the top. We stayed in the ""original"" wing,   it was wonderful, the pool area is unbelievable considering it is in the middle of a bustling city.  We could not have expected more from a Hotel"
"I went to the Sea Lounge of the Taj Mahal Palace for an afternoon tea with some friends. I think I am just stating the obvious when I say that the location was absolutely stunning and that the food was great. The best part of the experience though were the members of the staff, never in my life I had been assisted by such welcoming and friendly people. It all started when I decided to wear the saree that I had bought in the morning to look good, however, despite the several tutorials I watched on youtube, I ended up being more similar to a scarecrow than anything else. Bits of the dress kept falling from my shoulder and I could barely move my legs (honestly getting to the buffet was a pain). Anselm, a very helpful waiter working at the Sea Lounge that saw me in such conditions"
"A experience and expectation, I could not have imagined from Taj Hotel-Mumbai.  The people, there deliverance of care and making sure your stay is best to none.  They would do anything and make sure your request is fulfilled.  What the Taj did for me and my wife on our honeymoon, I would not be able to imagine!   All I can say book your stay there, as every penny is worth the value and more!  I can assure you now, any trips to India Taj Hotels anywhere in India is where I will stay."
"This hotel is well organised, very well maintained and spotless, all it's staff are so courteous and accommodating and there is just simply a quality to all it does. I spent 3 nights there in October 2016. The pool area is very nice with water regularly brought round. There are 3 choices of restaurant for breakfast including once outside.  The hotel is well situated for walking to a number of major sights as well a cheap transport to not to close sights. walking to Churchgate Station for the journey to the international airport is a flat 25 minute walk through a historic area that is worth seeing. Finally, Thank you to all the staff for making such a nice holiday."
"It was my 61st birthday.Last year my daughter had taken me to a resort at Bintan.This year I felt she would be sngrossed in her new job and work.Being  a weekday,she called me up and asked her to meet me at her office.We  went to Colaba and I was wondering where we were heading to at 5pm.Destination:THE HARBOUR BAR,The Taj Mahal Hotel for HIGH TEA. What a spread of the most lipsmacking dishes.So beautifully displayed,the attendants were so courteous.The masala chai was just tooooo good.Unlimited cupes of tea,we gulped down,as she was prancing up and down with some work related phone calls. The service does close at 6.30pm,but the staff give you a hint that you can fill up whatever you want to eat on a platter and keep it on our table.The desserts were out of the world,I mean the"
"This was memorable trip and we have enjoyed each and every moment right from reception till leaving the hotel and after wonderful experience, would like to come again here and also go Taj properties at other locations also."
"This lovely, historic hotel is the best. Everything was perfect. I am extremely happy with excellent service of Reception and Housekeeping staffs and Manager’s exceptional service in couriering my left items in room drawer. Thank you Housekeeping Manager!"
"I have had the privilege of staying in many outstanding hotels across the globe, the Taj is the first one I write a review on. It is simply outstanding. The staff make all the difference here. Friendly, attentive, discreet, utterly reliable. The rooms (I recommend to stay in the old, historic palace wing) are fabulous. Cleaned twice a day, with attention to every detail. They even folded my clothes. My sunglasses were on the nightstand. They cleaned them, put a glasses cleaning cloth underneath and put my glasses box (that was on a different table) right next to it. In the evening a nightkit of body lotion, pillow spray and eye gel greeted me. Fantastic. They hung my wet bathing suit and put some washing detergent next to it, in case I wanted to rinse it. The spa treatments are"
Average sleep quality due to knocking voice coming in the room. no action taken despite of raining the complaint. Cant expect this in a very basic hotel ..... and this was supposed to be best in class Five star hotel.
"One of life's musts at least once in your life.   Whether visiting with your family or with your partner the Taj Mahal Palace will you alter you emotionally and intellectually for ever.  The passion in its history and the beauty of its architecture will put some things in perspective for you.  Very much worth the line up, but go with a guide so it's history is all laid out for you while you're present; there'll be many surprises. "
"I have never experienced such an amazing service. Everyone is giving their best to make the stay in the hotel incredible.  In addition, the rooms are very beautiful, confortable and clean. Theyalso offer a free heritage walk during which you get to know something about the history of the hotel, what is very interesting and gives you a new perspective about the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who needs a relaxing and quiet place in the crowded city of Mumbai. You really feel like you are in a different country while staying in the Taj Mahal Palace. The only negative aspect might be the price of the food options in the hotel, but there are many other cheaper restaurants around."
"This hotel is a glorious piece of history both old and contemporary. It is overlooking the Arabian Sea and the Gateway to India built for George 5 and is also now fully recovered  heinous terrorist attack which is eloquently remembered in a beautiful memorial in reception. The hotel has everything which a five star hotel should have.....large comfortable rooms with the most comfortable of beds......staff which are plentiful, polite and happy...such a change to be with people who seem to be happy in their job and show it form the lift button presses to upper management they ooze contentment and pleasantness.  Food is plentiful and tasty...menus are extensive but all is well cooked and wonderfully presented. This hotel is well worth a visit when you are in Mumbai...a haven from"
"This was a fantastic experience. The hotel staff have an exceptional attention to detail. From the greeting you get by the front line staff, to the cleaning staff - they all have one agenda and that is to make your stay a wonderful experience. This they achieved and more. I would highly recommend this hotel."
"I know I have reviewed this hotel before but I keep coming back and I want everyone to know that it just gets better all the time. This is probably my favourite hotel anywhere.   All Taj Hotels benefit from friendly, efficient and discreet staff, and the staff here are supreme.  No service was too much for them. We had a lovely suite on the sixth floor and loved the comfort and the facilities.  Since our last visit the coffee shop has moved to a more accessible location just off the lobby and seems to have attracted a local following with a lower cost offering, but the quality is even higher than before.  The only issue for me was the sophisticated lighting system in our suite, of which I never quite got the hang.    Bravo to the management of the Taj Mahal Palace, and thanks to"
"What a place , luxurious and yet friendly we got an upgrade to one of the heritage rooms for our honeymoon lucky us .tried the various bars all were great . Took the free tour of the hotel as well very interesting . If you want a treat no better place"
"Stayed for two days at the wonderful old property. Beautifully maintained, very courteous staff.  The rooms were very clean and wonderful.  The old world charm by the décor was very warming.  Our room overlooked the pool area, so did not have a sea view, but was very nice nonetheless. Overall a world class hotel to stay and get pampered."
"The property is grand, beautiful, and a true oasis in Mumbai. The staff is incredibly friendly and thoughtful. I was traveling solo and they helped with tours and restaurants. Stay in the palace wing which is highly recommend."
My wife and I decided to spoil ourselves at the end of our holiday with 3 days at the Taj. We wanted to stay in the old Taj rather than the newer tower building. Both areas offer opulent lifestyles but we wanted to experience the history of the place.
"The Taj was glorious.  I'd happily fly back another 16 hours to stay at the hotel for a week and never leave it.    We arrived at 4am and they had upgraded my room from a tower city view to a club room in the main palace, complete with butler service and access to the Palace Lounge for all-day treats.  It was lovely to have the butler come and show us around the room at that hour and to bring fresh-squeezed juice, as we had just come off 2 days of traveling and were weary.  It was a refreshing welcome.  We chose the Taj because of its location and historical significance.  The tours we were taking were headquartered behind the hotel, shopping in the area for tourist knicknacks was fun but prices higher because of the location, quick access to the Elephanta Island ferries, views"
"I feel glade to share my personal experience with hotel taaj Mumbai. It was a great experience with taaj. First and foremost thing is the sight and location of hotel. It is situated at sea view, which gives pleasure to visitors, and even to me. Staff are really professional and well trained on customer service. They know how to make customers feel satisfied with their service.  Food I clouding dinnar, breakfast are of excellent t quality. There is every kind of food, breakfast including Chinese, Japanese, Indian, panjabi, haryanvi and dishes from outer nations. Hotel cares every customer from arrival to Mumbai to return. Another benefit is that hotel stay connected with its customers through email communication. I would suggest this hotel to everyone."
"I was very lucky to be upgraded to the heritage wing of the hotel. This wing is stunning.  I wish I have more time in the hotel.  When I walk into the room, I feel ready for bed. The room was nicely decorated and makes you feel you are staying at your own home.  The bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom is very luxurious.  With rose petals scattered at appropriate place. The amenities provided are all paraben free. Fab  Breakfast in the sea lounge is a treat. The view of looking out to the gateway of India is lovely. The breakfast is a buffet breakfast with plenty of choice.   Would definitely come back again."
"Every time we go to India we always fly home from Mumbai so we can stay here for a few days.  If you are staying here stay in the original Taj wing and even better stay in the Taj Club - it costs a bit more but worth it.  This is a proper 5 star hotel that puts most others in the shade.  You are instantly made to feel like you a permanent guest, the rooms, food and excellent service is faultless.  A luxury oasis."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is one of the best examples of beauty and British influence in India. A majestic hotel with a variety of bars and restaurants as well as rooms facing the bay or interior to the pool. We were upgraded to a corner suite - a muti roomed suite overlooking the harbour with a turret room and separate dining, office and bedrooms. Overall service was exceptional as would be expected for a luxury hotel of this caliber. Our only disappointment was that the food in the restaurants was mediocre, lacking sufficient flavour and spices. They were not fine dining but tailored to a European palate. We ate outside the hotel, but never-less enjoyed all other aspects of the hotel"
"Possibly the most beautiful building in the world, even with scaffold on one of the towers the it is still perfect. As all the information says get there early, not Fridays and try to avoid weekends . Don't be rushed take some quiet time to appreciate it and take those special photographs. No mater what I said you would still go and it's worth every penny or rupee"
"i dont have a words to explains how wonderful the taj hotel is............i have visited with my family to enjoy the dinner  with my family from my first salary ....excellent service, helpful staff, this hotel is situated at a beautiful location near the Gate Way of India. i wish to visit once again..."
"I travel a lot and have been to many places around the world and most of my life is currently getting spent at Hotels due to my hectic business travel.  From my experience so far, I would rate ITC grand chola to be among the top 3 hotels I have experienced so far.  I have stayed multiple times now and love the restaurants here- particularly Peshawari!!!! The staff is very warm and welcoming and they greet you like they are your family. Very nice and awesome staff and is a very beautiful place located approximately 27 mins or 11 Kms from the airport which is a very nice thing.   Even though Chennai is a wonderful city- ITC chola is so good that I am actually planning a vacation here sometime soon with my family."
"A truly beautiful iconic hotel that exudes charm and character staffed by warm and helpful people who elevate service to an art form, they knew what I wanted before I did so myself!  A wonderful experience luxurious and relaxing.  Hope to return soon"
One of if not the most breathtaking things I have  seen.  I just did my third trip to the Taj Mahal and it still takes my breath away.    Truly magnificent.    You need a good couple of hours to see it properly.
"Taj Mahal at Agra, India is one of the wonders of the world.  Originally built by Emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb his wife, the Taj Mahal remains an architectural marvel of the modern world. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, it remains one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a stunning symbol of India’s rich history"
"Stayed 09/21 thru the 24rth and truly felt like a princess.It was our first trip to India and we were celebrating our anniversary,they upgraded us to a heritage suite overlooking the gate of India which was a pleasant surprise but the best was yet to come.The service of the hotel staff was outstanding,from the moment we stepped into the hotel till we left we we're treated like royalty.We ate at the indian restaurant and the staff surprised us with a cake and 2 dozen roses,for breakfast we ate at the sea lounge and we're always seated near the window overlooking the water and had delicious indian masala dhosas what a treat, the staff always were in tune to what we liked.Please do forgive me as I may not take the names of the numerous ladies and gentlemen that made our stay ever"
"Taj Mahal Palace is the best hotel I have ever stayed. I was given a free upgrade to an executive room in the Palace Wing of the hotel. I was mesmerized with the architecture of the palace wing. The corridors, the royal stair case. It was like a dream come true for me. It was a true blend of luxury, art and elegance."
Everything was excellent. We celebrated my wife's birthday and Taj Group went out of thier way to make us feel special!  We really enjoyed our meals at Golden Dragon restaurant and a special mention to the fantastic swimming pool they have ! Highly recommended!
"Hectic weeks have passed and business challenges ahead! So I checked in on Sunday and to my surprise got upgraded to the old taj. Always a super experience. Stepped out for my meals except for my breakfast in the morning. True Indian hospitality at its best. Eggs benedict, beetroot carrot juice, sausages, semolina South Indian style and phew what a spread. Par boiled asparagus with hummus.. nice. Went back for a nap while I recharged my batteries to take on more challenges and back to office at 5 pm. Should do this more often."
"Very nice looking building, which must have amazing views but I can only guess as I didn't stay there. For the history buffs a bit of colonialism in the modern world. The architecture is lovely as are most buildings of this era."
"Everything was just so comfortable at ""The Taj"", the room, the bed, the bathroom, the restaurants, the pool. The service was attentative without being over the top and attention was being paid to the tiniest detail. This is one of the most comfortable and friendly hotels I've ever stayed at."
We chose to have lunch in one of the best hotels in the world.  Sook is located on the top floor of the hotel and we decided to try the place with a view.  The Sunday brunch didn't disappoint with a wonderful variety of Middle Eastern delights from soups to desserts.  It was an expensive meal as far as lunches go but was worth it for the experience
"We stayed in the Taj Mahal Palace for 4 nights between 1st and 5th October 2016 - myself, my husband and our friend.  We had 2 adjacent rooms in the Tower, looking out onto the Gate of India.  The views were wonderful.  Our rooms were a fairly ordinary size, but both rooms were very comfortable, very well appointed and felt very ""homely"".  When we had to wait for 40 minutes or so for our rooms to be ready for check-in at lunchtime, we were given some Chai and cookies delivered to our room.  The hotel also helped us to celebrate my friend's birthday and retiral from work, with a cake, balloons and flowers.  Service from the Housekeeping team and also from the Butler on our floor, was outstanding.  We were given a footbath in our room, with rose petals; foot soak; foot loofah and"
"We had a wonderful 24 hours here - service is great, people friendly, food good, and hotel is beautiful. We spent day in pool and spa. It's the perfect retreat in a very busy city and I hope to go back one day soon. "
"The Taj Mahal Hotel is almost perfect. a landmark with service to die for. fabulous views of the sea  - especially in the day  only the restaurants don't measure up. they are great. but not as good as the Hotel, its ambience and its service."
"Went there a few days back with family and it is certainly an aristocratic hotel maintaing standards of excellence. It is pricy but worth it. With stunning view of the sea , and its many restaurants provinding excellent food and unparallelled service it is a great place."
"This was our second stay in the Taj, this time for 4 nights. We've been lucky to be upgraded to the Palace wing which made our stay extra special. The room was superb and the service with the floor butler is just impeccable. One afternoon we returned to the room to find balloons, roses and a chocolate cake all provided by the hotel as a birthday surprise! Absolutely amazing! The restaurants are really lovely and the afternoon tea in the Sea Lounge is still a very good value for money and an unforgettable experience."
"My last stay here was awful. Dirty dried rings of food and drink on tables, torn towel in bathroom, insects on plate in restaurant - twice, dirty cups, broken chair in room, filthy balcony, filthy water coming out of the shower, dirty glasses, intermitant hot water, black particles spitting out of the aircon onto the food, you name what can go wrong we experienced it here. I would never stay at Taj again. We left early and went to Oberoi. Have stayed at Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai before and gave it 5* because the staff were incredible, so on the ball and so polished, but it's really gone down hill since then. Heartbreaking as this was my favourite hotel in India until now."
I have visited this place with my family bt its a great place for couple or friend.. its a hotel with all facility and buffet is also present.. wifi facility is also there.. The food here is quite amazing and it will cost rs 3500 for 2 people appx.. Special site of attraction on sunday.. so go have it and try it once..thumbs_up
"Location of taj is awesome and sea view rooms are really superb. please visit compulsary feeling is good.   Biriyani is very delicious.  Every person must visit this hotel. in this hotel western,southern,chinese,itaalian all type foods are available."
Pristine and an architectural British marvel that stands majestic on the edge of the Arabian Sea. Luxurious and has an old charm attached to it. All in all a wonderful and comfortable stay. My go to hotel in Mumbai.
"This is one of the best hotel I have ever stayed in. I stayed in the room of old building and had a really good time with all the master pieces of furnitures and decorations, as I guess all are antique. Taj Mahal Palace dose a good job in protecting the Indian culture. Also, I love their services."
The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is I think the most luxurious hotel and the most luxury service you get here the staff here is really very kind and patient the rooms are fully equipped with amenities the food here is awesome
"An out of the world experience staying in a hotel seeped in history coupled with excellent hospitality. Celebrated my wife's 60th. birthday with complimentary upgrade, balloon decorated room (over which my grandchildren freaked out) and also received a lovely complimentary birthday cake in the room. Great breakfast with multiple choices and helpful staff working to fulfil all desires. Could not have been better."
"My wife and I spent one night here as a birthday treat. Sometimes you can have high expectations based on reputation, but can leave a bit disappointed. However, I am pleased to say that our stay at the Taj exceeded our very high expectations. The hotel is an icon of Mumbai and India and everything about it fulfils that status. The rooms and the common areas, as well as the restaurants are all fabulous and we really enjoyed spending time in them. In particular, lounging by the large pool with a cold drink is pretty special. On top of that, the standards of service are excellent and everything we needed was catered for efficiently and quickly. The hotel upgraded our room to a suite and laid on flowers and wine in the room as well as a birthday cake for us. We really couldn't have"
"Yeah, that sounds silly, I get it, but that's exactly how I felt when I woke up the last three mornings! We had booked a sea-view room in the heritage wing and loved the experience. Everything about this hotel exudes pure class, and we are glad that we had decided to spend the long Dussehra weekend in Mumbai and at this hotel. They add some delightful touches to your stay, like luxurious sleep kits, and jewellery pouches with bangles, ear-rings and bindis. Real nice! One night we had returned to the hotel around one am and my husband badly needed a muscle relaxer due to shoulder pain. We just had to ask and one was sent to our room within minutes. AND no one came asking for it back during our entire stay - now that's hospitality."
"As much as I hate to admit it, I love fancy hotels!  The Taj Mahal Palace is at the top of my list.  I arrived after a 13 hour train ride - hot, sweaty and dirty.  Walking into this place was like a wonderland.  From the moment you step foot on the property, you are in excellent hands.  My room was beautiful, they upgraded me to a room facing the harbor and the view was breathtaking.  The bed was so comfortable, the bathroom, an oasis.  But what makes this place the best is the staff.  Every single person there seems to really care about the hotel and their guests and it shows.  Sure, you can stay at a nice hotel in Mumbai for less than $100 but for a very reasonable rate, you can stay at this wonderful place and I highly recommend that you do!"
"The Taj Mahal Palace - It is always a very good experience at Taj properties. Taj palace Mumbai is one of the finest property and the hospitality of the staff is superb. What more can I say, except that the Hotel operated on my / the guest's frequency."
"The best hotel I have stayed in.  Excellent service, beautiful rooms and great amenities. The staff go far out of their way to make sure you have a great stay.  The butler on our floor was amazing as were all other staff members we interacted with.  We eat at the Wasabi restaurant one night. Amazing sushi and also great saki.  Would 1,000% recommend this hotel."
"It is always a very good experience at Taj properties. Taj palace Mumbai is one of the finest property and the hospitality of the staff is superb. Comfortable stay, delicious food and ever smiling staff take it to the highest standards."
"This Hotel must surely be the jewel in the Taj crown. Recently, I spent three nights in the Taj Club sea view room. I chose this Hotel primarily because of its vintage, location and reputation. Many prominent figures have stayed in the hotel (including one or two despots) during the last 100 years or so.  The Hotel more than lived up to its reputation. The hotel staff are brilliant in attending to your needs quietly, and without fuss. They seemed motivated, interested and incentivized. The housekeepers don't just clean and maintain your room. They observe and carry out those little touches that enhance your experience. For example, I had been working in my room using my laptop (and mouse). When I returned after lunch, I found that a mouse pad had been thoughtfully placed under"
"Aware of the reputation this hotel has I went for dinner with freinds and visited the Indian Restaurant.Our waiter was very attentive and the food was excelent. The bill wasn't too bad either, so don't be put off by that. Have sinc been back for a few beers in the bar, overlooking the Gateway of India. A great expereince."
"We had a lovely 5 night stay at the Taj. The hotel provided us free upgrades to the heritage wing of the hotel even though we had booked rooms in the tower wing. Thank you Karishma and the other staff at reception, the wonderful staff at Shamiana and the porters for tending to all our needs. We had a wonderful time and hope to see you again soon."
excellent stay at Taj Taj Mahal Palace hotel. Warm welcome at time of check in and nice room with sea facing as well India gate. Food was too good as well service and all staff are too gentle like serve a love. This is my second trip At this hotel and both time nice experience. Thanks to taj family.  
My first stay at THE TAJ. A wonderful experience. I needed to use business center late at night. at 12am. And the hotel staff was as prompt and professional as it could be. Excellent view of the Gateway of India and the sea. A multi-cuisine break-fast with all possible options and choices.
"I am currently staying at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai and so far I can't find fault. When I arrived I was greeted and taken to the lounge to fill out my guest form. A member of the staff came to advise me that my room wasn't ready and so they would like to offer me a complimentary upgrade to the palace wing which is totally charming, really has a feeling of the British Raj period of India and the room is huge. The pool is lovely and close to the spa where free of charge you can use the steam room and the relaxation room which has comfortable lounging beds, relaxing music and delicious tea. The high tea in the Sea Lounge was a bit pricey at 4,000 rupees but really worth it. Don't miss the 5pm tour of the hotel - very interesting. The staff are so incredibly attentive,"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is of course an icon in Mumbai; therefore i had very high expectations before i arrived.  The building is stunning and it really is a haven of relaxation in the centre of a very crowded city.  My room was on top floor, generally well set out but had a damaged light fitting, scratched TV screen and some water damage around the inside of the windows - not what i would have expected.  I had a club floor room with club lounge access - this unfortunately was the worst part of the hotel experience. The lounge was drab and univiting and the food served during the day and at cocktail hour was amongst the worst of any club lounge i have experienced.  Staff are attentive (verging on the over attentive many times). I dont need people to stir the milk into my tea or put"
"This hotel was just fantastic. The staff provided the best service I have ever received at a hotel any where in the world. The hotel itself is a very attractive building and right opposite the gateway of India. We could see it out of our bedroom. A special site. We paid for a club Room in the palace and while expensive it was definitely worth every penny. Afternoon tea, pre dinner drinks and snacks, after dinner brandy and chocolates and a late check out was all included in our stay and it really made it a special experience. The pool was lovely, the gym well equipped and was all well air conditioned. I really cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Adrian, our butler was so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble and always greeted with the best smile. Truly hope"
We spent four wonderful nights in the Taj Mumbai. The staff were lovely and very professional without being stuffy. The rooms were spacious and were in keeping with the era this hotel was built. It was like going back in time. The pool area was fabulous and they brought round little bottles of cold water and some fresh fruit at regular intervals. This is the little touches that make it special. We absolutely loved it.
Taj Mahal have sections one is palace which owsome and you feel like you are princess section two is tower which is quiet different as it has different style not that much high quilty.differnt between them just pay little more price it's not worth and live in place.over all the staff are helpful and amazing. Taj Mahal is the best hotel in India .
"The Taj Palace is the best hotel I've been to, hands down. Everything from their breakfast selection, to the helpful staff, to the beautiful pool area was perfect. They went out of their way to make our stay relaxing. We are are already discussing returning next year. You must also try their afternoon tea while you are there. It is amazing, and far surpasses any of the equivalent London hotel's offerings."
This hotel is amazing. The service by all the staff will amaze you. The old part of the hotel takes you back a hundred years and the place is so clean with every facility you could ever need.  The pool is outstanding and the breakfast is the best in the world. We stayed in a club king room and had our own personal butler and she was magnificent and tended to every wish we had. It was our wedding anniversary and we we showered in roses. Congratulations to the manager and all the staff.
"Taj Mahal palace  As a frequent traveller to Mumbai for the past 10 years, this hotel stay was always an aspiration. And I managed to stay for 1 night in March 2016. Travelling with my sister, who wasn't keen on the taj or south as a loyal fan of another 5 star in Juhu,   I managed to sell it as the 'princess hotel' (guaranteed to make us feel like princesses). Luckily for me, the TAj delivered on every little detail, from a wonderful traditional welcome by Valencia on Reception, nice rooms with great views of the Arabian to generally courteous staff. The highlight was a special free celebration of the Holi festival by the hotel pool. Great location to explore 'Colonial Bombay'. Awesome breakfast buffet too. Only negative would be overpriced room service... the price and the"
"This hotel is a jewel, we stayed in the heritage side for 4 nights  . Rooms were spacious and clean, as it had recently been renovated with the highest standards.   Breakfast in the sea-lounge just cant get any better.    Staff were  friendly, always trying to help.   Would definitely come back to this place again."
"Be ready to be pampered throughout your stay. When you request for something, the staff makes it their mission and going the extra mile is a common trait across. There is absolutely no doubt that this hotel defines high standards for others to follow.   Rooms are well appointed. If you are in Mumbai for leisure, then the location is ideal. Multiple restaurants offering cuisines from across the world. We tried Shamiyana for breakfast and Masala Kraft for Lunch..Simply amazing."
"The best hotel in Mumbai and India as TAJ knows the best sense of hospitality,the treatment,food quality and ambience is excellent. The stay is ROYAL and we salute the people of TAJ and whole management,who make possible the BEST STAY for its customers. Keep it up."
We found that staff loves to do their job hence great service. Food quality was good and cooked as per our taste/request. I would even recommend to local people for great week end with good nearby night life including marine lines etc
"Heard lotsa about Taj but was rather disappointed during my stay.   The check-in service was rather slow (not ideal if you are rushing out for a business meeting). It took more than 20mins and they had mixed up my room with my colleague. In addition to it, they had charged both my room and my colleague's room under my corporate card even though both of us presented our cards during check-in! So it was rather odd when you called for room service and they addressed you differently...  Rooms wise, they are rather old and has a mouldy smell. The cupboards look as though it would fall apart soon.  Only thing that left me with a good impression was the in-room dining. The food was good.  Conclusion, both my colleague and I will not be staying here when we are back again in Mumbai."
"This hotel is a beautiful hotel in the center of Mumbai.  The amenities and service  is great, but they charge for everything, making the stay prohibitively too expensive.  You are better spending the same money at a different hotel chain"
"This was my first time in The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai and stayed in the Palace wing. The service and the rooms are amazing in the Palace side. The 5pm hotel tour is a must, starting from the Palace Reception. I was too busy to try the speciality restaurant but the cuisine in the main restaurant was great."
Hotel is quintessential Indian hotel and will get you in the mood for your travels.  Great service and large open rooms.  Every feature has been well thought out and ties back to Indian decor.  Well located
"You really must stay at the Taj if it is within your budget.  Gorgeous hotel and the staff are outstanding and do everything in their power to make your stay enjoyable.  It is also not stuffy like some other 5* hotels - you really get treated wonderfully whether you are a dignitary or a backpacker.  The eating options are wonderful too - in fact, we ate at the hotel most nights which we don't usually do."
This hotel is just great and worth each Rupie. The food in the Marsala Kraft as well as in the other restaurants is unbeatable. The little extras make your stay a unique experience that you will always remember. Spa and pool offer extra quality.
Really nice place but it's too expensive.... It also depends on person to person.... But it is must visit place there are around 7 restaurants.... you can visit as per your choice.... I have ordered Chivas 18 yrs old with Chicken black pepper fry. Food is really really nice.
"I recently stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for 3 nights. I had booked a Deluxe Tower room and was told on arrival that I've been upgraded to the Palace Wing. The room is on the small side and tired in need of refurbishment. Nevertheless it was super quite considering Mumbai noise pollution is unprecedented. The stand out feature of this property is its costumer service. Every employee is extremely polite and eager to assist. All my requests from housekeeping was responded to within 5 minutes. Lalit, the butler is so well groomed and soft spoken and could easily land a job at Buckingham Palace. Breakfast offered a large variety of Indian and continental items. Live cooking stations, fresh juices and fruits. Large selection of bakery items and exceptionally good coffee. Room"
"I have been blown away by the outstanding level service at this hotel. It is all that's been advertised to be. First of all you're greeted with tremendous attention and respect, and a Butler takes you to your room and shows all the amenities which include cleaning your room three times a day, luxurious toiletries and the most amazing equipment to turn on and off the lights in the room. Fresh fruits are left in your room as requested. All the restaurants on the premises are outstanding, particularly breakfast which is the best I've ever had at a hotel. The attention to detail at every level makes your stay at the Taj the highlight of any trip. I would recommend this hotel without any reservations to anyone visiting Mumbai, in fact one of the main reasons to visit the city is to"
"I had gone to celebrate my wife's birthday. The staff made arrangement in the room for celebrations. Besides this, we recieved personalized attention throught our stay despite so many guests in the hotel. The Taj Palace lives up to its reputation in providing customer delight."
"Taj mahal palace offers the best to their guest..   They have the best restaurant property and with the best and different food offerings at its best..   And their staff at their best.. T mistry at Harbour Bar , to Snehal and Dominic at the secret of the taj mahal palace Chambers and the Secret Snake is being remembered.. and team at wasabi.. and shamiana..   These people were at their best and made this stay at its best.. can't wait to come back to Taj Mahal Palace..   Cant thank taj more their food and hospitality and service.. Have to say this being a fan of Oberoi Group you have won me..  thank you taj mahal Palace tema..  hope to see you soon.."
In simple words. we loved it and the best part was that we it was raining all the time. It was raining and draining all the time in Mumbai. we had booked for tower and staff team makes us comfortable at Palace.
"This hotel provides a level of service from staff that has not been surpassed in our  2 decades of travelling, irrespective of location. They truely set themselves extremely high levels and achieves them in almost all aspects. We stayed on the palace wing and i must admit it was great having a butler service on call as well as being steeped in history all around you.   Disappointing though, the hotel was almost perfect, but not perfect for the following reasons, which i hope their management reads and acts on (it would be a shame otherwise):  1. Wifi in the bedrooms on the upper floors (4 and 5) is shockingly poor - actually quite useless and frustrating - it falls away most times and when it does run, it is quite slow  2. There was a large stain of what seemed like a water leak"
Excellent hotel extra luxury. Very beatifull inside where you can appreciate India culture. Excellent food in Japanese restaurants with the price aligned with the quality. Excellent also the location in the city center and the shops inside the hotel 
"This place is epic. The architecture, artwork, food, drink, staff, service; it's all second to none. The room is beautifully furnished and super comfortable. Staying here takes the edge off the Mumbai craziness and you can spend ages just pottering around admiring everything. Particular highlights were the huge breakfasts overlooking the harbour and swimming in the amazing pool. Definitely recommended if you are visiting Mumbai."
A very unique hotel with full of history located just next to the famous India Gate.  It really gives you a taste of the deep history this beautiful country.  The breakfast is full of many choices which is really nice.  I have been to this hotel several times and I would come again if I have the chance but the only drawback is that sometimes they take a long time for checking in.
"Taj is Taj proved again and again. In one word. GOOD. Secured,very decent staff. Good wifi facility. Good room service as well. Masala Kraft is really good especially ""Baegon bartha"" dish made of Brinjol for vegetarians."
The hotel in Mumbai is like a palace from fairy tale.The building is very old and beautiful. The room is very big . You just go out and room service clean and set your room  all the day .The pool is very nice and the sea view also.
"All is taken care of from the time you enter the gate. Bell boy to the reception to the checkin. However, parking and any events in the hotel can be a disturbance. But the staff do their best to make sure you are comfortable. All staff is friendly and concerned. Must recommend a visit here even if for a night."
"I would absolutely recommend staying at the Taj, our stay was wonderful. It was my partners birthday and they provided cake and other treats for us as well as a sea view room.  The staff are incredible throughout the stay, the food choices are great (Wasabi is a must try), the room was spotless and beautifully laid out with everything you could need. It was a treat to stay in such a historically important hotel that performs to an excellent standard and is value for money. We hope to return again!"
"i made this reservation for my father for his 75 years birthday to revive his childhood times in india..requested the hotel to make his stay memorable spoke with manager mr gaurav who is on duty and he has upgraded his room to amazing seaview room,  providing eggless cake for my vegetarian dad, and decorated the room.. indeed it was memorable and surely has told gaurav that i will come there to experience myself.. big thanks to gaurav and sneha who accepted initial call and whole team of the LEGEND taj mumbai"
"This year I spend my birthday at Taj Mahal Palace Suite.  It was an amazing experience.  Compared to the previous year's I had gone through.  After a long time I truly enjoyed my birthday night stay.  I got my room immediately my suite butler helped me organized my room for my friends to accompany me in the evening for my celebrations.  It was just perfect.    This is my first time doing a massage at the Jiva Spa at the Taj & I was not too happy for the same.  The spa room & the women's changing area are at the same level hence I could hear all the noise (especially a mother shouting and making her daughter cry) is very disturbing.    The one thin which irritated me the most was the evening cocktail at the Palace Lounge. When I arrived (which was pretty late), firstly the entire"
"On our visit to Mumbai I took the family to stay at the Taj for the sheer experience having seen the TV series. The atmosphere and the ambiance is no different to when I've first visited the Taj in the 70's as a youngster, just that it's become more renowned. We stayed in the Heritage Wing which had a fantastic views to the Gateway and the Arabian Sea. As it is iconic there were crowds outside the hotel from around 10am in the morning into the night except if it is raining! We had the opportunity to have breakfast in both Shamiana & the Sea Lounge - service being impeccable and attentive. If you like to taste a wide range of dishes definitely go down to the Shamiana, if you want to enjoy the views go to Sea Lounge. Breakfast choice is less at the Sea Lounge, however you can"
"Stayed just one night and what an amazing experience ! Staff make you feel like royalty ! It is without doubt the finest hotel we have ever stayed in. From the moment you arrive right until you leave , you are respected and looked after . The staff pay great attention to detail, they are professional , efficient , courteous and they work tirelessly to ensure your stay is made special for you . This hotel and the staff are without doubt are a cut above the rest !  Thank you to all the staff for making our night one that will remain a special memory!"
I can not talk highly enough of the staff at the Taj Palace Hotel. During my visit I needed to see a Doctor.  The staff arranged this for me and made the ordeal a lot less stressful than it could have been.  I appreciate this.  Hotel and amenities are amazing too.  Thank you for a fantastic visit once again.
"The best Hotels are voted as the  best year on year because of heritage and the people who work there and their services. The Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai is one of the best hotels in the world with respect to everything. It's like a museum with exotic collections of paintings and artefacts. The palace is surely  an icon. We were treated with extreme care and humility by every staff we came across. The staff comprises of young and the experienced working for 30 years or more. The palace lounge now moved to the ground floor is a place to be at for its peace, tranquility while you sip tea. The tour of the heritage wing, yoga in the morning, and evening diya lightings keep the tradition alive. We were upgraded by the management on a surprise while we chose to celebrate my sons 4th"
"I had booked a room for my parents' 40th anniversary. Little did i know that that was all i had to do to make the occasion special for them. The rest of it was taken care of by the hotel ! My parents had a lovely time there. The 'avbhagat' started when they checked into the hotel... From the welcome aarti with tulsi malas, to an upgraded room, from the handmade disney character card to the balloons and Happy anniversary pillow and finally the chocolate cake.. They even took them for a heritage tour of the hotel telling them about the history of the place.. The staff was very sweet and kind.. A big thank you to the Taj Hotels for adding to our joy on this wonderful occasion. The art of making guests feel really special has been honed to perfection by the hotel !!! Thank you..."
Taj Hospitality at its best !! truly from the heart.  the check in experience was excellent. we had a gorgeous sea facing room in the Heritage wing.  bfast was well laid out and great options for each guest. the new Shamiana brought back fond memories of our early days in Mumbai.
"This is one of those hotels that you never want to leave.   Staff were all amazing, room excellent - stayed in the palace wing where the rooms are stunning.   The hotel is in a great location to explore and the team are on hand if you need maps etc.  Excellent stay. We couldn't thank the team enough. "
"The Taj 's  personalise spirit of warm hospitality is much noticed in this luxury hotel ! Strongly recommend that you opt for the Palace Wing that will show you and give you a authentic luxury of this hotel and make memories last forever !  This hotel preserves a world class legacy .... Do not give a miss to its diverse collection of paintings and works of art ! It reflects an important era of creativity in Indian History !  Its inspired cuisine , attentive service with magical settings is worth a try and splurge .... To highlight its  panoramic view of Mumbai harbour and the city have a dinner at Souk Restaurant !  Its location by far is the best in Mumbai for a leisure traveller , while on biz , well choose as per your appointment settings as the city traffic can make life"
I had the great fortune of staying in the historic Wing section at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai. For anyone wanting to experience what life might have been like for the Maharajas & Maharanis - this is the place to stay. Even the private butler and staff made me feel like royalty. Thank you !!
"I had always wanted to see the Taj Mahal and it definitely lives up to its grandeur, beauty and sheer overwhelming presence. Our tour guide took us at sunrise and it was worth the early morning alarm to be one of the first groups on the property. Don't forget you are not allowed to have anything with you that could potentially deface the building. No makeup, pens or even a selfie stick! They confiscated mine but gave it back upon departure. If this is a place you've always wanted to go, be sure and make your dream a reality. This is one spot I will surely never forget.  "
"it was excellent to stay at palace, i will back with family soonest and overall service is very excellent, the security is system is very best, i need to add some tamil tv channel and  bbc news, it will quite better for all,"
"I had an awesome experience at the hotel. My husband had planned a surprise staycation for my birthday.  The staff is amazing and did everything in their power to make me feel special as we were celebrating my birthday. The services were exceptional and this will be one experience that will be very close to my heart. Thanks for making this experience a fabulous one and want me to keep going back. I wish I had taken down the name of the managers who personally looked into all the details of decorating the room, arranging the tasty cake and providing a complimentary lunch to make my birthday a perfect one! The Taj team is doing a super job!!!"
"There were many issues faced by me and i had conveyed them constantly in writing but no redressal.the hotel is damp and rooms full of moisture.i suggest to avoid and better opt for the trident or leela of hyatt instead which far far more better service,spacious rooms with more better and latest amenities than this one.also families with kids must restrain their kids like hitler did as by mistake if ur kid makes some little stains over the bedsheet .they come running with a bill of 2300 bucks for whole of bedsheet charge saying that the stain cannot be removed without showing or telling me how whether they have tried enough to remove it.u get water droplets falling on ur head and platter while dining in their restaurant shamiana and all they can say is sorry.i will change ur"
"The hotel's original building was commissioned by Tata and first opened its doors to guests on 16 December 1903.  It is widely believed that Jamsetji Tata decided to build the hotel after he was refused entry to one of the city's grand hotels of the time, Watson's Hotel, as it was restricted to ""whites only"". However, this story has been challenged by some commentators that suggest that Tata was unlikely to have been concerned with 'revenge' against his British adversaries. Instead, they suggest that the Taj was built at the urging of editor of The Times of India who felt a hotel ""worthy of Bombay"" was needed.[1]  The original Indian architects were Sitaram Khanderao Vaidya and D. N. Mirza, and the project was completed by an English engineer, W. A. Chambers. The builder was"
"Beautiful hotel in a perfect location.   All the staff were exceptional, from front desk, to restaurants and loved the Butler service since I was upgraded to a Club Room in the  Palace Wing. Now I just hope the rain stops. "
"Stayed 3 nights in the new part, although arrived very early we were treated as a special guest and upgraded to a greater room directly viewing the ""Gateway of India"" from the new building. From reception to restaurants everything is very unique-elegant and satisfying. Got the Hotel Tour to really discover the history. A perfect stay for a couple. Definitely try if you can and fell the real luxury embedded in history."
"I have visited Taj Hotel for the first time in August, this was so exciting as it is one the Best hotel in the India. this is the my best experiance of my life. At entrance I was start feeling like a celebrity. Had food at Shamiyana in Taj taste was awesome. We had also taken Tea."
"Hotel truly deserves the title of a Palace. Experience is unmatched, each and every member of the hotel team makes you feel like a royalty. This iconic Taj property, has a spectacular view of the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea. You do not experience the true hospitality till you stay at this prestigious property."
"We had stayed three nights at this 100+ years since it was originally built. The hotel location is opposite the ocean and the Indian gate. All staff were very keen as always offering supports and services including smiles as they walk by or when guests require any. Their breakfast is extremely organized, consists of multiple kinds of selections, well served and presented to guests. We had booked/utilized their Mercedes car for airport pickup and was fantastic try."
We came for sightseeing and visiting the place and also for lunch . Sadly was a let down I ordered a cocktail worth at least 985 rupees it was not worth it that much he forgot to add the alcohol we had to send it back. My mum ordered a mock-tail she also had to send back for second time the good thing is they didn't charge us for the drinks but the service wasn't that great. The drinks am had too much coriander I wanted chilly sauce it took them 15-20 mins to get it to me which is a very long time. It is worth visiting I am sure it is very expensive hotel to.
"We stayed here for the first four nights of our honeymoon in a club room.  The hospitality, the service, the attention and kindness we received was just wonderful. From pick up to departure everything was perfect. The check in was so efficient-first time we have ever signed in in our room on an iPad! We loved the decoration of our room and welcome cake too. We loved all the personal touches and kindness from the cleaning cloth for my glasses to  the gift of scarves and  foot bowls on our final evening.    Our Club room was always spotless and we would especially like to thank our housekeeper who even ran us a bubble, bath with rose petals! Our breakfast service in the sea lounge was excellent, as was the high tea service in the palace lounge which we visited every day. We also"
I have visited Taj Hotel for the first time is was soooo exciting as it is one the Best hotel in the World and center of attraction of Mumbai. It was an amazing experience. At entrance i was start feeling like a celebrity. Had food at shamiyana in Taj taste was awesome.
"Overall Experience was not good at all.   Understanding brand ""TAJ"" my expectation was very high. I had asked to use upgrade suite vouchers. However I was denied for upgradation stating my booking is not more than 5 nights. TIC platinum desk had to call for making necessary follow-ups with hotel to upgrade the suite. By the time I receive upgraded suite, have already lost 3-4 hours. Duty manager offered to extend my stay as a part of compensation, however that was not convenient to me.  I asked to compensate the same with lunch –meal expenses, however I was told that is not possible.  Another very bad experience I had during Dinner. My expectation was Buffet dinner. However Shamiyana restaurants does not have Buffet dinner. I felt 3 core set dinner was false marketing"
"Hotel service is awesome, although located in a very busy place. very huge hotel and the cleanliness is at the highest level. i didn't try the food during lunch or dinner but i had a breakfast and it was excellent. Very recommendable hotel if you can afford"
This was mine first visit to Mumbai and also in this hotel . The hotel was very well build and i was in love with this place . Rooms were really big and well maintained  and the service from the staff was very nice and felt like home. When comes to restaurant  ambiance was really great and food was really mouth watery.Overall a great experience and will visit this place again.
"I was in the hotel industry for  6 years and I have to say the Taj hospitality is phenomenal. The staff are very attentive to all your needs. The concierge desk helped us with restaurant bookings and even did a pharmacy run for me. We unfortunately didn't  get to dine in the restaurants as I had a ""Delhi belly""."
"We were lucky to be upgraded to the palace wing for our anniversary but despite that I would still recommend the hotel. We are back packing for 2 weeks and arrived after a 17hr train journey. I could not fault our welcome, treatment or service. It was beyond anything I could have imagined and all the staff were lovely. While we booked this for a special occasion I would def look to stay in other Taj group hotels based on this experience. When we left the front security called us in a taxi for the airport, noted the number and checked the meter was set correctly prior to allowing us in it. He then provided us a card with a number to call if we had any problems. If you are in Mumbai this is a must stay place, location is superb and service is out of this world. "
On entry we were greeted the traditional Indian way. Both my wife and I were really happy with the way the staff treated us. Excellent service I must say. Loved the stay even thought it was for only a day. Very professional staff and the buffet breakfast at Shamiana was awesomeface_savoring_food  The interior decor and the princely rooms had the flair of royalty. Unfortunate we didn't have enough time to spend there.  Something tells me we will be back! 
"This is an exceptional hotel, with amazing staff who seem to genuinely care about service and your comfort. There are newer hotels with more up to date facilities perhaps, but they lack the charm of the Taj Palace and Tower, which does not feel like just another business hotel. The spa is great, as are the restaurants. I return time and again, both for business and leisure and have never been let down."
the management should be particular when appointing persons who are interacting with the guests..Taj still in british era.foreigners are given prefrence over Indians at heir restaurants and lounges.Expecting the management to look into the matter.
"The minute you arrive at The Taj Palace the majesty of the building captivates your heart.   With sweeping staircases exhibiting the splendid view of the original Palace Wing, the sound of the pianist echoing through the vast corridors you can not help fall in love with the splendour and decadence.     Breakfast, Lunch, High Tea, Cocktail Hour, Dinner, Cognac and Chocolate  Tasting which ever occasion your pallett desires there is a restaurant, bar or lounge to cater for your every need.   From the world renowned Wasabi restaurant to the more traditional Masala Restaurant your taste buds will be tantalised and you will be presented with culinary experiences suited to royalty.  Comfortable and chic with a feeling of familiarity the Palace is more than a hotel it is a destination,"
"Everything about Taj Mahal Palace was good. Even my 3 year old baby girl liked the service to the room. We stayed at the palace wing. The restaurants at the hotels were fantastic too. We tried Shamiana, japanese restaurant, golden dragon and seaside lounge. I recommend everyone to take the Club Room."
The hotel is an excellent property and very well maintained. What sets this hotel apart is outstanding service from staff and very homely atmosphere. All the amenities like room service and restaurants are simply world class . The property is very well located near the Gateway and is an iconic property.
"it was a unique and unforgettable experience! we felt treated like empresses and it s so hard to think of a life with all this comfort! we were breathing india and all what it is about sharing, caring and lovleiness! the food was wonderful, the spa is great, sitting at the poolside was a quieting journey even in the monsoon rain. we are coming back , again and again and again"
The Taj Mahal Palace hotel is at one of the best locations in Mumbai...  The hospitality is at its best. Rooms and the views are awesome. Architecture of the old building and the way its being maintained is too good.  Undoubtedly Taj Mahal Palace is one of the best hotel I have ever been. We had a great time at The Taj Mahal at Mumbai...!!!
Excellent hotel. Simple booking error: Check in reception: Pay up or else!!! Long Trip. Overnight travel. Tired. Had to sign. Left a bitter taste in the mouth right at the outset. Lots of character though. Limited seating in the reception. Try parking yourself at the far end & you'll have to fork out for an expensive coffee or shift!!!
"This hotel honored my feedback from a previous visit and on this visit, in the Palace Wing I enjoyed a flawless service from each member of staff I encountered. Security appears to be serious yet discreet."
"This is an historic, spectacular property.  Not only has it been visited by a cast of important politicians and  famous entertainers, the hotel has been maintained and improved over the years.  Even if you don't learn some of its history before you arrive (and you should), be sure to take the complimentary hotel tour to begin to get a sense of its storied past.  The location, overlooking the iconic India Gate and the Arabian Sea, is unsurpassed by any of the other luxury Mumbai hotels.  The food is excellent, with enough restaurants (of all kinds) in the hotel that you never have to leave the lobby area to discover great dining opportunities.  The staff is seemingly always available and more than willing to assist in any regard. Special thanks to Glen for arranging my airport"
This hotel is wonderful. Very old school glamour and service levels. Te staff is so nice and welcoming. You feel really well cared for. The palace wing is beautiful and the rooms are large and well appointed. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is large. It like coming back to an oasis of calm and relaxation after a long day in humid and hot Bombay. The hotel and the rooms smell of jasmine. Super nice. Make sure you book your room in the palace wing. 
"Without a doubt one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.   The staff are elegant, well trained, very helpful and make the place.   Quite understandably security is tight but even that is carried out with style!  Add a stay at this wonderful hotel to your bucket list!!"
It has the best view from the hotel. Its ambience is also really good. Good staff and fast serving. It is located on the coast of mumbai. I visit here often for business meetings. Facilities in hotel ka really good.
Writing this review while currently enjoying our stay at this hotel.  Loved everything about our stay.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff.  Right from our suite to the cocktails at sea lounge to the breakfast everything was perfect.   Will surely come back without doubt. 
Hi I visited some one for business meeting  and I had buffet breakfast   which amazing and all staff are very polite and helpful  south end  of mumbai view of gateway of india  and Hotel has excellent facilities  
"We chose a Club suite in the Palace wing as a special treat for our last night in India and it exceeded all our expectations. The Taj is magnificent, the staff are wonderful. Hopefully one day we'll get another opportunity to go back and repeat the experience."
"Very friendly and helpful staff. From Club Lounge to Sea Lounge, from Lobby to Poolside nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff.The rooms are really well appointed experience a must try. Sitting at the pool in the day time or the evening is a fantastic experience.The food is tasty"
This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel and yet again we have had a wonderful time.  Although it is a very big hotel (which l am normally not a great fan of) their staff are all absolutely wonderful and extremely charming & helpful and their attention to detail is remarkable.  We asked for a room with a view of the sea & the Gateway of India which was very comfortable and in the old part of the hotel.  The breakfasts have an excellent section to choose from and the hotel is in a good position for walking around the heritage sites plus you feel safe walking out to restaurants locally for dinner which we did.
"Wonderful stay at the Taj , highly recommend a stay at this hotel , staff , service , food , everything about this hotel is excellent , rooms are exceptionally clean and service is wonderful , throughout the hotel ."
"stay at Taj Mahal Palace was value for price.Overall I think It's the best .But I think price a little higher of food,though the taste was very good.The environment is one of the best.Lush green all around thrills you."
The hospitality at Taj is beyond ones imagination as the team continuously genuinely and innovatively endeavors to offer customer delight to all its customers.  The hotel trip was fabulous as it helped drill deeper into the history of this historic heritage monument.  The Palace lounge was a pleasant surprise and kids enjoyed their time at the pool and varied restaurants.  Overall an memorable experience for the family to be remembered and renewed everytime we head for a holiday.  Something remarkable is that each and every staff greets you with a smile ....my compliments to their trainer who mentors them genuinely express that smile .....very unique and unmatched greet.   I wish Taj and its staff all the very best .....The owners and managers of Taj should really be very proud
"Mumbai is a vibrant and exciting city and we spent the first few days in a Boutique hotel which really matched the charm of the city. The Taj however is an opportunity to escape the power of the city and enjoy the opulence, charm and style that typifies this hotel. It is truly a remarkable step back in history, but still enjoying wonderful amenities, service and food. The staff will go out of the way to look after you, you cant go to Mumbai without staying at the Taj!"
"Amazing and attentive staff, pristine rooms and a quality of service appropriate of a Palace. Food quality exquisite, selection of wines astounding. From Club Lounge to Sea Lounge, from Lobby to Poolside nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff. Thank you so much for making our stay so special."
This is by far one of the best hotels in the world. The unique location and the history make this a must stay if you are in Mumbai. The rooms are really well appointed experience a must try. Sitting at the pool in the day time or the evening is a fantastic experience. It is so quiet from the hustle bustle of Mumbai. The lighting effect on the famous dome at night can be seen from miles away. The food quality in the coffee shop is very well executed. The bread selection makes you feel like you are in Europe with the infinite selection of freshly baked selections. You can experience East to West to South and North all in one kitchen over breakfast. The hotel really excels in treating every guest like a royal. Go and enjoy. Good selection of restaurants including a Starbucks on
"I am currently on a business trip in India with three other business associates. We are visiting seven cities in 3 weeks. We scheduled several hotel stays in Taj Hotel properties as they came highly recommended. Our first stay at the Taj Krishna in Hyderabad, was very enjoyable and the staff was extremely helpful. Out next visit was to be at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai. Due to a business need, two of our team needed to cancel their stay with short notice. We tried to contact them to cancel the two nights and ask for some concession on the late penalties due to the number of nights we would be at their properties. When I contacted Taj Mahol Palace I asked for the duty manager and the reservation team would not connect me to him to work through the request, I sat on hold"
"We arrived to a very warm welcome and a seamless check-in to our room in the palace wing 5th floor, club level with stunning ocean view and overlooking Gateway to India.  Delightful decor. The history of the hotel is amazing and the complimentary historical tour was excellent.  We enjoyed a wonderful cocktail each in the Harbour Bar.  Excellent service. Travel desk and Concierge were very helpful and the Mumbai experience was bettered by their attention.  We had an option of two breakfast levels, but we breakfasted  at the lobby level  each day and we cannot speak highly enough of their exceptional service. Magalhaes was fantastic, understanding our love of Indian food and helping us to try food we have not eaten before. Exceptional waiter, anticipating every need and so full of"
Recently attended a conference in the crystal palace room. The hall was huge and seating capacity was good. About. 120 attendees. It was cramped for the lunch session. Food was decent. The desserts were superb. 
"One of the best memory of my lifetime ! Well said customer service is about emotions but the service at taj was above excellence. Everything was arranged before hand by the staff. Great rooms and ambience , food and in house stuff was mesmerising . Best location and was a privilege being at Taj ! Thanks guys"
"I am writing this review whilst still currently staying at the Hotel and do not feel the need to review after stay. I was upgraded without any fuss or fanfare, they could hence did it. What a wonderful gesture and what a wonderful room in the old wing. What never ceases to amaze me is the extremely high level of service this from Reception, concierge, room service etc..Needless to say the Hotel and the location are fantastic but a holiday can be marred if service levels are compromised, needless to say this is not the case at this hotel, the thought and consideration applied when requesting anything is fantastic. I have stayed at many a Hotel but nothing beats this Taj Hotel. It was late in life that I could afford to stay in such opulence, equally however when in Mumbai I will"
This was hands down the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in.  Their customer service is exceptional and there attention to detail is unrivaled. One example is that they replaced my deodorant when it was empty - no charge either.  My girlfriend was sick while we were there and the staff were very helpful and attentive. They also have a doctor on-site who was able to come to our room when we needed her and the price was very reasonable. She arrived within an hour.  Our room was very spacious and had lots of little extras like a TV in the bathroom mirror.  The surrounding area is full of beggars as you might expect with Mumbai being so overcrowded and poor. This was more of an annoyance than anything else as they are persistent.   The gym and steam rooms were really well kept with
"Truly luxurious digs, with rooms in elegant Rajputana Palace house style. It’s a relatively tranquil getaway, with expansive ocean view.    Without any doubt the best city hotel I've ever stayed in. Staff: friendly, unassuming, helpful.: welcoming, Room: well decorated (for my daughters birthday cake &gifts), well maintained. Food: Good but not the best. Special mention of Yoga session in the morning.It was amazing especially the Shudi Tea given by instuctor. Thank You"
"I visited the hotel for a coffee and a cake in the brasserie area. The hotel has a grand entrance (once you get past the rude security personnel). To sit in the lobby for a coffee you have to pay a fixed charge of 750rs which includes a tea or coffee, pretty steep in my view, and not worth it when you can have a coffee in the lovely brasserie restaurant for c200rs. The ambiance in the brasserie was good, it had a very clean, fresh and modern feel about it.  So, I ordered the sugar free cheesecake which turned out to be pretty tasteless, I'm used to sugar free cakes as a fitness fanatic, but this fell short of my expectations, I politely expressed my disappointment to the waiter, and asked for a replacement coffee (I ordered a cappuccino which was served like a latte). Then, they"
It was a pleasure staying with Taj...a dream come through....hotel staff is very good......rooms are good with a view....a one should experience a stay in Taj if you want to enjoy a historical venue and off course a gourmet of luxurious food and dont miss the first bar of INDIA with a license number 001....
The dim sum lunch at the Golden dragon is just perfect. The cherry on the cake is of course the Bao with pipping hot soup inside! Courteous service and warm Taj hospitality makes it an expirence to cherish!
"Amazing. Beautiful old colonial style. Butler came to room 5 mins after check-in with welcome drink. Staff super helpful without being in your face the whole time. Very comfortable bed, luxurious linens. Full of character and not musty like some classic old hotels can be. Shame I only had one night. "
"I have been visiting the Taj Mumbai since I was a child, and each time I return, I am filled with wonder.  Its the see and be seen hotel for the old guard, and has a great lobby for people-watching.  The views from the rooms (overlooking the Gateway and the ocean beyond) are sublime, the dining options plentiful and delicious, and the atmosphere chic and cool. A must-visit when in Mumbai."
"Fabulous hotel, one of India's finest.  It's located a stones throw from the hustle and bustle of the India Gateway which is a splendid arch in the water.  The hotel itself embodies all the finest of luxury available in India.  There are porters everywhere available to assist in a moments notice. "
"Incredible Hotel and Service.  From travels all over the world, it the best aside from the location of being in India. The area is typical India, kind of seedy, dirty and out of control streets but once you are in the hotel, it is like a different world. Super clean, fun and more... Enjoyed the large pool and poolside service.  Our room was the best with tall ceilings, great bed and room.  If you go, stay in the Palace hotel building and not in the tower."
"We've travelled sufficiently, both within and outside the country and I have to say that experiences at Taj properties have been the best that we've received by far.   The Taj Palace was no exception here. In fact, it was a tad better than earlier experiences at other Taj properties. Kudos to the management and the staff in putting together an experience like none other for my family and me.  Thank you."
"Our inaugural honeymoon location welcomed us with a room full of red heart shaped balloons, a 'congratulation' cake & 2 nicely lettered pillows! Fantastic view, despite the ongoing exterior building refurb. Overall a distinct quality eye for detail in every respect, excellent value for money."
"We decided to stay at the hotel to end our trip to India and rest before returning to Spain. The hotel was fine, but because we were traveling with backpacks, they judged and treated us as if we had enough class or money to stay at this hotel. There was a problem with the booking because we booked one day before, and the hotel not only charged us the two rooms that had not been used but also they charged us the supplement for the extra bed, which was also not used. In addition, we had to pay in advance, as if we were to go without pay ... It is a disgrace. It is a pity that we could not enjoy the last days of  our trip because the hotel is prejudiced. In addition, not only we could not pay for a night but paid for two, appearances are deceiving.  As I said before, you should be"
"Welcome was homely, the staff was professional, Warm feeling, me my family especially my kids enjoyed the stay. Well maintained rooms and the entire hotel made us feel like Home. Will Visit again. Thanks Team Taj."
"Pillow were smelly and uncomfortable. Dinner Buffet was given in the package and given Rs. 2500/-, and any dish was not less than 1300/-.  Room given in the tower was very small. I suggest people going for luxury should not opt for this Hotel."
"If you want top quality surroundings & service this is the place! A great setting close to Gateway of India; a beautiful building; helpful, friendly staff who go the extra mile with a smile & a choice of superb restaurants. What more could you ask for."
"We were treated very bad, and felt like the workers were non-professional workers. Treated us as if we had no money to pay the stay, cause we were backpackers.  First, they made us pay two nights, because of a confusion in booking, plus the extra bed which as we were not there one of the nights obviously was not paid. At the time of the check-out, they called us 30 minutes before, to make sure we were leaving the room at the exact time, if not they were reminding us we would have to pay an extra. And they made us pay the stay, at the time of the entrance, which is never done. So felt quite uncomfortable at the hotel, even if it was a luxury hotel and we went there to had a good time, and enjoy."
"This is a beautiful hotel worth visit. The history around it makes the visit really interesting. The pool, the restaurant and also the shopping area deserve some time. It is also well located and in front of the gateway to India that witness the last British troops leaving India following the country's independence"
"We visited this historic and amazing hotel - its palatial and exquisite.  From the main foyer, flowers and the mall area - the outdoor guest only area which we also walked through is gorgeous.  There is so much marble everywhere.  We took the drive to this side of Mumbai especially to look through this special and historic place."
I was not sure where to book a hotel for my first trip to India and very seldom go for the high end Hotels. The Taj Mahal was recommended to me and when I saw the rates I was hesitant.  I must say this hotel is right up the with the Peninsula in Hong King and the Oyster Box in Durban and for half the cost of those 5 star establishments. Somehow the Indian manner of service has an authenticity to it that I have seldom encountered anywhere else in the world. 
"Very comfortable stay with excellent service from well trained staff. I enjoyed all the restaurants at the hotel and shopping experience in the arcade was excellent. The spa service was totally different experience which helped me relax, rejuvenate."
"After our lovely stay at Hyatt regency this was a disaster. Grand Hotel wonderful reception with very welcoming staff but that's it. As soon as we entered the room it was smelling of damp and mold. We thought may be we switch on the AC and open the window, while we were out for the day, it will be fine but on our return we found the window was closed and the AC was switched off. We switched on the AC and got freshen up but smell didn't go. The smell was so strong we had to call the front desk and asked them to come to the room and see if anything can be done.  The manager also noticed the smell and offered us a room change.  Since it was midnight and we were tired. We didn't bother to pack everything and move to another room. They got the damp bed sheets changed and got the"
"So much has been already said and written about ""The Taj Mahal Palace"" in Mumbai! So, I'll be brief and straight to the point! It is iconic, magic and unforgettable! And to really feel being part of India's history, book a room at the ""Palace"" - the heritage area, facing ""India Gate"" and the Arabian Sea. The modern ""Tower"" is nice, but similar ones can be found anywhere else in the world. The magnificent Palace, built with Moorish, Oriental and Florentine characteristics, only in Mumbai! Enjoy the beautiful flowers, the art master pieces that ornament the whole building, the lovely pool and the many and delicious restaurants of ""The Taj Mahal Palace"". Don't miss ""Jiva Spa"" and its experienced therapists - allow yourself a relaxing massage and, totally revitalized, get ready for"
it was a very pleasant stay and was so happy to get an upgrade to the palace rooms as a complementary gesture from the hotel. Thank you so much. the rooms are well done and the whole aura of staying at a 131 year old heritage hotel is definitely worth trying out.
It was a beautiful evening at Taj Mahal palace hotel's cafe and the lovely music played by the talented lady on piano made it so much more special... The kids couldn't take their eyes off and the espresso they served me was perfect... Couldn't havan asked for more 
"The Taj is perhaps my favorite hotel in the world. It's hard to think of another place that combines great service, history, beautiful surroundings, amazing location, great restaurants and all of the other touches quite like this hotel"
"Very good hotel with heritage and modern architecture, beautiful location, pleasant and helping staff at all times. Just an excellent family experience...My kids enjoyed a lot. Will strongly recommend visiting this hotel. Only thing is that if you are vegetarian and have different food preferences, then inform hotel well in advance."
Celebrated my 1st wedding anniversary. The hotel staff was very courteous & helpful.. They keep improving their service.. every time have been here they keep innovating & improving.. They  pamper you .. Thank you so much for making my special occasion .. so excellent &  something i will remember for my lifetime..
"Its pretty hard to fault one of the top hotels in the world! It has the complete package, magnificent and historical 110 year old building overlooking the Gateway of India, superb service, good range of restaurants (see separate reviews). As i said the service is excellent and the staff will go out of their way to help you. One tip if you decide to stay there is dont stay in the Tower Wing, stay in the Palace Wing. The difference is incredible and its certainly worth the extra money it will cost you. If/when we go back to Mumbai we will stay at the Taj!"
"The non plus ultra of perfection, every detail is flawless. I appreciated the quick check in and check out (even if i got charged of minibar by mistake) Rooms with view on Gateway of India - palace wing are lovely and very spacious. Silent a/c, comfortable bed. Very good Wifi speed. Just a pity to leave. "
nice stay and good staff.we like food .room was big and great lobby is very big and room also very large my kid like this hotel very much and kid like hotel Chechen food  front office staff to help full and great deal with guest.
"Being a Taj Innercircle Gold Member am entitled to a free stay for one night on any weekend.Chose to go on my Wife's birthday & was overwhelmed by the super service & amenities offered at this iconic Hotel.A special mention of Miss Amrita Singh for a breeze check in & taking great care of us during our stay.Spent a memorable evening with my wife at the Harbour Bar & the newly renovated ""Shamiana"".Staff at this Iconic hotel strive hard to give the best service & make sure All guests have a great time.#Tajness rocks"
"As always, my stay at the Taj Colaba was excellent. Each year,I stay there at least 4 - 5 times. the staff are extremely pleasant, very well trained, and it always feel like home. The food is tasty, the rooms are clean and no request is ever considered difficult."
"Its very perfect and pure symbol of love ,great architecture and design,enjoyed a lot,very Beautiful and great monument ,historical place and romantic Destination also.it was very stunning and pleasuring moment ."
"The building, history and location are all great but what makes the Taj stand out is the service, not just for being professional but happy staff that are genuine in their desire for you to make the most of your trip. It's great to see it add some more dining options since my previous stay - normally I always like to leave my hotel to find food, but with India sometimes it's nice to not have to hit the streets. I really enjoyed the opportunity to try Mumbai street food in the Sea Lounge. My trip was business and leisure. It was good for business with a ray of sunshine brought vs the blandness of a typical business hotel. For leisure it was wonderful."
"The hotel continues to be great, with very good level of service. It is situated in a very lively locality, with many shops and eateries.  Breakfast spread is good but there is scope for improvement by including more diversity to cater to international clientele.  All in all, a very pleasant stay."
"The location could not be better, the Hotel is world class across the board. Breakfast was OK, Sea Lounge is always full so you have to wait. Also the rain made the stay a bit less interesting but overall it was excellent"
"This is an extraordinary place to be in while visiting Mumbai.  While outside the city is buzzing with vitality, noise, humidity, heat... as you enter the Taj a sense of peace and quietness cools off our senses.."
We had a shaky start when things weren't right - but the staff rose to the occasion and put it all right - so we had a great stay. It's a measure of a hotel that when it makes mistakes it puts them right quickly and effectively.
"Brilliant hotel,with history,atmosphere and position.Pool and pool bar a must.We booked via Viator for walking tour of Mumbai including slums, plus street food of Bandra and Bollywood tour.Fun and not expensive."
"We had a lovely stay at Taj Mahal Mumbai Palace. The hotel is located in a lovely area and the gardens are beautifully maintained. The staff was just incredible - efficient, accommodating and very friendly. They made our kids feel so special and our kids loved their stay here. The food is brilliant, the rooms are lovely and the spa treatments are fabulous. Special thanks to Ms Ritika(Duty Manager) Can't wait to go back!!"
"I stayed for 2N/3D at the Taj Mahal Palace and loved the stay. Located at Colaba, with a view of the Gateway of India, makes it arguably the best view in the bay(had tried Trident Nariman Point last year too ergo the conclusion). Also the Colaba market is just a block away. The ambience is great and has an (obvious) heritage feel to it. I was booked in the Club Room with a sea view and it was worth every penny. My parents were booked in the Lotus Suite with the city view; the room was rather amazing and the view was pretty good here too. The poolside lounge area is very relaxing and a great place to unwind. Round the clock butlers on the suite and club room floor makes sure the hospitality is impressive. The restaurants are very good and are also frequented by Bollywood"
Very beautifull hotel located southly in Mumbai near indian gate where glamour of all over the world can find! Food is exeptional can choose between indian and also european oriented! Not far away from the hotel visit the famous Mumbai pear with a lot of fishing boats! Good job Tata!!!
A Palace to adore.....Service to perfection and the Feeling of utmost comfort. From excellent friendly and humble Service to a footbath with rose petals waiting in your room. Fruit baskets and other adorable surprises
The experience with Taj Group of hotels is always a very good experience. The service is fantastic and they treat very good. There is no extra charge for small stuff and they do not cut corners. I loved the stay and would always prefer Taj Group of Hotels for my stay.
"Historic property with impressive art work and antiques to admire all over the hotel. I stayed in the palace wing which is highly recommended if you really want to experience the old world charm and character of this property. I had an amazing room on the sea side which overlooked the Gateway. The service, food options, location and old world charm of this place make it a must stay!"
my parents bought me to this hotel when i was 8-16 years later it is still the best -just as my Mum always said it was  Everything about it is special and teh staff are wonderful It has changed over the years but i still love it
We had a beautiful waterfront room in the Taj Palace. The staff was excellent and so attentive to our needs. I arrived ill and the staff could not have been more helpful. This is a gorgeous hotel worthy of it's world class reputation.
"A fantastic hotel ! Great rooms, great service and fabulous food. We had a perfect view of the Gate of India. Wish we had more time to do this hotel the justice it deserves. So much to see inside this iconic hotel and outside the atmosphere just buzzes "
As any time i have chance to stay in Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai it's an Amazing time. Friendly staff come Always to my convenience and needs . Tantalizing the pool among the garden gives me relax and leisure. Rooms are quiet and very beautiful.
seems that the old mughals have recided here once there are all the facilites available in the top hotels of t=india the resturant and the garden is very awesome the tiredness of my whole journey had gone by the beauty
Stayed in the Palace wing for 2 nights. The service & ambience were awesome. Specially the Palace Lounge service. Keep up the standards. Would recommend this to each & everyone to stay at this legendary hotel at least once-you wont regret it
Stayed here for a weekend with wife and kid. Had booked a Sea View tower room and we were upgraded to a palace suite :) ... We got a fabulous room overlooking the Gateway of India and the Sea. The service was phenomenal ; from basics to making the baby food for my son. Had a wonderful stay ; if this is the hospitality in all Taj hotels then I'm definitely not looking for any other hotels from now :)
"Overlooking the sea and Elephanta Caves, makes the location of the hotel unique. The Palace wing retains all the features of old style Maharaja days, but with fully modern rooms. The rooms are extra spacious compared to other hotels."
"I just returned from a 2 week trip through Sri Lanka and spent a total of 4 days at the Taj at the beginning and at the end of my stay. This being my first time in India, the Taj made acclimatization in the first few days very enjoyable and very valuable.   The pool and the courtyard are delightful and tranquil and remove you from the India that lies on the other side of the wall. The function rooms and the various reading rooms are exquisite with wood panelling, deep leather chairs and windows out to the city and the gateway to India shows its excellence intact.   The room service was terrific. It was prompt, polite and the food very manageable for western palates. The local dishes were better and you have to try the Kingfisher beer.   I have very fond memories of the Taj as it"
"Hospitality of Taj Mahal -Coaba was out of the world  Prompt service,comfortable room .Please select the sea view  room in the palace ,as you can see the sunrise and sunset-Silhoutte of Elephanta and Navy ships and the Gateway of India which is nostalgic and being an indian so proud of it The staff of Taj especially the young and energetic duty managers Ms Kretika & Mr Husain were courteous ,patient and professional .The personal butler service makes you feel on the top of the world -Would return back for sure and  recommend to my closed friends and aquaintainces.In the end i would say Wah Taj -Tera Hospitality ka jawab nahin"
We stayed for one night for my husbands birthday. We were upgraded to the palace wing. The grounds were beautiful and the pool area lovely and well kept.  The floral arrangements were stunning. The view from the restaurant over breakfast was of the Gateway of India. Loved this hotel..would recommend a trip.
"Just finished a five day stay here. It was exceptional, and one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. For us it was the start of a 6-month backpack travel, where we wanted to try something special at the start of our travels as it is our honeymoon. We were fortunate to be upgraded to the palace wing which enhanced our stay.  The hotel has a 33m pool in the courtyard, spa services (with included access to gym, steam room and sauna), around 6-7 restaurants (or more). It's very easy to want to stay around the hotel experiencing all it has to offer.   Breakfast was enormous and you have to tell them to stop suggesting and offering different foods to try. We skipped lunch most days! Had an incredible meal at masala. And tried a few other places. They are expensive to eat so"
"class experience and really a heritage hotel and had a comfortable stay. Had a very good overall experience, beautifully located and is a value for money stay. Food was excellent, peaceful atmosphere and real tranquil peace"
"Hospitality is not only one of the best in the world hotels of any brand but is the best.  The ethos, politeness and ever ready to help is a hallmark  A great great experience and you are participating with great living"
"My wife and I stayed in the Taj Palace wing with our 6 year old son, and we had a amazing stay. The attention to detail and service is impeccable. The restaurants are wonderful we had amazing food at Wasabi and Golden Dragon. Would recommend that if you come to Mumbai you should stay in the Taj at least once. We will be definitely going back."
"On checking in we had some issues probably as a result of our booking agent, and the rooms we we initially given we smoking rooms (who smokes these days ??), then we were given musky smelling rooms in the towers (from reviews seems a common problem) which weren't satisfactory. However in a heroic recovery from the issues the GM sorted our rooms and moved us over to the palace / old hotel. From this point our experience was superb from our welcome foot spa's through to the hot toddies provided for an ill member of our group. Service was faultless. Would absolutely recommend the palace to any visitors to Mumbai and would certainly stay here again myself"
"The Taj Mahal Palace provides a memorable hotel stay. The quality of facilities and hospitality are amazing.   The staff members are excited to show off the hotel and its food offerings, and proud to be part of this venerable institution.    The hotel provides complementary bottled water and excellent teas around the grounds and in the guest rooms.  Guests can access many included amenities.  The design, decoration, and service are excellent.  The hotel also houses great restaurants.  This calm luxury makes the hotel like an urban resort.  The dining options cover a broad range of prices and cuisine.  La Patisserie offers cheap pre-made dishes and desserts. The Shamiana all-day dining restaurant is a great value option.  The other restaurants offer memorable adventures. "
"I was very excited about staying at this Hotel. However, having stayed three nights I was very disappointed with several factors - mainly the service, disorganised breakfast and the quality of the rooms (damp). This in an overrated Hotel save your money and go to a highly recommened Hotel "" The Leela Palace"" especially Udaipur. "
"This heritage Taj property was all about customer service. Right from them the valet parking to butler, the service we received was par excellence. .even the house keeping staff were wonderful. The palace wing is grand ..if you choose to stay at Taj Mahal Palace, I would highly recommend opting for the palace wing as the experience here is quite special. Palace rooms with sea view is an absolutely wonderful way to take in Bombay. Al though we had booked to stay at a different hotel in Bombay, we couldn't resist re-booking at the Taj! And it was totally worth it. If you happen to pop into Harbour Bar on ground level (first licensed bar), ask for their signature cocktail..perfect blend! Overall we are highly satisfied with our stay and will come back every single time we are in"
"This is the kind of place you need to visit at least once, even if just to walk through with a guided tour that they provide every day. Better, if you can stay here.  We arrived before India's Independence Day and you can imagine it was VERY busy. However, you would never even know it! The kind of service this Hotel offers surpasses anything I've ever experienced. From the welcome ""rituals"" that included skin products, drinks and fruits to incredibly lightning fast service, if we needed anything like extra pillows.   The hotel is simply gorgeous with that old world charm that you imagine when reading about Maharajah times and the glory of imperial India. Everything is well thought out, opulent, yet extremely friendly.   We stayed in the Palace section, not in the Tower. Our"
"Not one thing I could complain about. The hotel has a mix of culture and modern art and has great service, we were upgraded when we arrived to an outstanding suite and were given benefits of being a member, such as free drinks and services. The service was unbelievable. The staffs went to extra length to keep us happy we were treated like royalty."
"From the moment you arrive at the hotel you are treated like royalty. A warm welcome, delightful rooms and stunning views. The pool area is beautiful, and the service is exceptional. The only gripe is an India general one, why does no hotel ever have a decent hairdryer?! That aside, the Taj has that rare ability to make you feel like a friend and an honoured guest - in a hotel as huge as this, with such a turnaround of guests, that is a very special gift indeed. "
"This hotel has the heritage, regal and the elegance of a stunning beauty. The team too is simply outstanding. Very humble, ever smiling and really warm is the culture and ethos of this hotel. I used to stay here regularly as a kid and was happy to see some faces still after about 8-10 years. Called my dad and told him even he was really happy to hear that. Keep up the amazing hotel you are always."
Its a crown of Taj group. Nice view of Gate way of India. It gives a royal touch and redefines the hospitality industry standards. It does not need any introduction. A must visit hotel once in lifetime.
"No one would ever say No to you, if you invite them to Taj, I mean, The Taj Mahal Palace hotel.  It is epitome of luxury! I was lucky to experience this across several visits, largely as a guest, and one of them was at Wasabi, by Morimoto. Like an average Indian I too would write the place is outstanding, and it really is. The food there is perhaps the best I've ever had in those dishes, and the safe bet was to stick to the chefs reco, after they ask you about your taste pallet. Go for it!"
very good service and nice location. Palace portion is even better. it would be nice if there are some activities for the kids. very attentive staff about the requirements. so overall very satisfied with the visit
"We did not stay here, but did pop in for lunch and somehow managed to negotiate use of the pool for the afternoon lol.    There are lots of very famous people who seem to live here, or spend a large part of year in this hotel.. and I can see why.   Overlooks the Gate of India, right by the sea, out of this world food and service, total perfection.. the sort of service that exceeds your expectations.   Always a very very good sign.  Its also very popular as a venue for a variety of functions, including weddings, business, parties, family events, although I would say that's only possible for those with spare disposable income."
"If you ever want to live as a king or want to enjoy the royal fantasy. Just visit this Hotel. The extravaganza of the exotic taste and the luxury is simply ""Lavish"" and ""Royal"" !  This is indeed a national heritage and a state of the Art hotel which is indeed the pride of our country !  If you're looking for a hotel in Mumbai this is a must stay !"
"The Taj is a must-see in Mumbai, if only to enter the hotel and enjoy it's majesty. You can see all the famous people who have come to visit the Taj. The area is well-lit, the amenities are sparkling clean, and the service is exemplary. A truly enjoyable experience. "
"Palace style, high level service, great amenities! Location is ideal, heritage building is splendid and the personnel is of top quality. Restaurants are also top notch and we highly recommend the hotel for a luxuy Mumbai stay"
"Excellent ambience, very comfortable stay, excellent staff to look after the needs of a traveler, whether on business or pleasure. We have stayed in hotels worldwide, but the hospitality of an Indian Hotel is superb, especially the Taj Hotels, pan India."
Staying at the  Taj Mahal Palace Wing makes you feel nostalgic of the grand events that this hotel has seen. The rooms are tastefully decorated and guarantees you a comfortable sleep . The room service and the housekeeping team are commendable . They are always ready to attend to your requests. Please enjoy the history walk that the hotel provides and the evening ritual at the pool area. The serenity of the ritual is one to behold.
"Recently I stay with with my family it was a Wonderful Experience, Excellent hospitality , you always treat with a smile , Awesome food & drinks Ambience of Heritage wing is marvellous thanks to Samiksha who take us on small tour of hotel & tell every thing about the hotel & history behind it .... I think it's one of the best heritage hotel in India"
"“Taj Mahal Palace lives to its name and reputation!”  This is the most luxurious hotel I have seen in India so far after Taj Falaknuma. I rate it better than. Even when compared to foreign hotels, the grandeur and elegance of the interiors is top class. The palace wing especially is a treat for eyes."
"Good place to stay once in your life. Beautiful hotel, good service, surrounded by history of previous visitors. It is pricey when it comes to meals etc. Great location. I enjoyed my stay and would stay again."
"Surely one of the most iconic hotels in India. It is not cheap but what style, what history and what service. The hotel rooms were immaculate, as was all of the hotel. Great views of the gateway to India from some of the rooms and restaurants. The swimming pool was superb. The staff were amongst some of the most attentive that you will ever meet. Nothing was ever to much trouble or done without a smile and genuine concern to please. There are plenty of restaurants within the hotel catering for a wide range of tastes and prices. The famous ""from the bar 1933"" cocktail is worth it just for the theatre of its preparation. The hotel is well placed to explore some of the most interesting parts of Mumbai. "
I have been in The Taj Mahal Palace once when I was in Mumbai last month. I have been here together with a friend and my boyfriend for afternoon drinks. I drank two different smoothies which were tasty. They also offered us complemantery bites two times. This is a really lovely and upscale place to stay. The Taj has a luxury interior and a lot of fresh flowers everywhere. Even the toilet is worth visiting.
Execellent Hospitality and ambience. Except from the sky lounge service it was so bad that they were diverting us to go to shamiana down stairs. That was the only bad experience for us rest are excellent especially amritha's service was extraordinary.
This is the best hotel you can ever stay in in Mumbai city starting from the location to the inside atmosphere to the staff and service every thing was great  I've been there for two weeks and I stayed in the place sea view room facing the gateway of India really nice view  And I like the maharaja afternoon tea in the sea lounge where you can try different dishes from different royal families secret recipes 
"So, I tend towards hostels when I travel by myself, but for the family trip to Mumbai we stayed at the taj Mahal. For me, it was one of the highlights of the city. I love the history, the gorgeous interior, the location and ocean view, and the wonderfully attentive staff. Plus, I am a total sucker for the little surprises housekeeping was always leaving in the room.   If it's more than you can afford/want to pay,i still recommend stopping bye for a drink or piece of cake or something. It's lovely! "
"My stay at the Taj Mahal Hotel (Palace Wing) was indeed a pleasure. The welcome at the reception, the warm smiling hotel staff was truly amazing. Since my stay was a short one I was only able to dine at the Golden Dragon and spend a couple of hours at the Harbour bar ... Excellent !! I look forward to staying at the hotel again."
"This is the most luxurious hotel I have seen in India so far after Taj Falaknuma. I rate it better than Leela. Even when compared to foreign hotels, the grandeur and elegance of the interiors is top class. The palace wing especially is a treat for eyes."
Our stay was wonderful and memorable. we spent excellent time at the property and looking forward to visit again. Staff was very kind and informative. the arrival was welcoming and courteous. the hospitality and cleanliness very really appreciable. the food quality was excellent.
I will repeat this experience again. So relaxing and in the centre of Mumbai. Staff in the hotel are so friendly and the smile is always there. The location and view from my room was unforgettable. I will always select Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai for my future visits and for sure will recommend it to all my friends as it is the best to stay in and relax after a long working day.
"I was let down by this hotel. although still getting four stars. Due to this reputation I thought his place would be outstanding. It wasn't. The staff were attentive, and the reception pretty spectacular. Sadly the rooms were not, I found other hotels in India which cost 300 rupees much cleaner, it would seem the rooms in the tower need renovating. The bathroom was old and mould was appearing. As well as marks on the walls. Despite this I still had a pleasant stay, with the staff being the highlight."
"All the legends about their legendary hospitality is true.   Felt like Alice.  Thanks to all the people there, we will remember our stay forever.  Staff are warm and friendly, they smile genuinely and care about your needs. Every person we talked to was very helpful.  Each time you leave the room, when you come back its made and there is something extra. Some times a flower decoration, sometime a surprise gift.  Food quality is exceptional, though waiting for breakfast is a pain.  Check in and check out experience is incredible"
"This is such a wonderful Heritage hotel that once you step into it, you are in a whole different world of royalty and luxury. We stayed at the presidential suite which is the most beautiful and royal room i've ever seen. It's Beauty is beyond words. Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is truly no less then a Royal palace. I will never forget my experience here and can't wait to be back.."
"Overlooking the Arabian sea, Taj Palace is  the ultimate in luxury in hotels. Over the years visited many times to attend conferences and meetings regularly and unfailingly found the service and the decor always maintained. Had a major setback during 2008 because of a terrorist attack, but bounced back in style and restored most of the old glory, but with added security (necessary) protocols to go through. The grand lobby is something to go for and the conference rooms right on top of the hotel as well as the ones inside are well managed. Took my family for a brunch to the coffee shop and did a tour of the hotel to see the luxury and the hospitality of the place."
very nice experiance we are really enjoyed this with hotel and booking . next time we are coming with my family.  very good keep it up.   service was very very good and this hotel maintain very good staff members
"First trip to Mumbai and our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace certainly made it a wonderful experience. All the staff were extremely helpful and polite, made us feel like royalty! Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Mumbai."
"If you want a memorable stay in Mumbai , the only name that comes to my mind is Taj. the legacy that started more than a century ago is still on. What I hear while speaking to management was that with  560 rooms and 44 suites. There are some 1,500 staff including 35 butlers. From a historical and architectural point of view, the two buildings that make up the hotel, the Taj Mahal Palace, and the Tower are two distinct buildings. I prefered the OLD one...  After the 26/11 attack , the management has taken efforts to bring back the hotel to its fullest glory and they have been successful in it.  Best wishes to management"
"We visited and stayed in the iconic Taj Mahal Palace ( just for leisure purpose) over the weekend. The stay was truly made special by the cheerful checkin staff Ms Lubina Pathan. To begin with, she upgraded us to the Primrose Suit and made the evening memorable by decorating the dinning room for the welcome celebration of our unborn.  The suit was grand and the view from its balcony was simply spectacular. It overlooked the Gateway of India and the room tidiness matched / surpass the Taj standards. The one hour ""Taj Mahal"" heritage tour was very insightful and gave good insights about the glorious past of the hotel.  Overall a relaxing getaway made memorable by the hospitable staff and the beautiful suit.  "
"The best hotel in Mumbai, two minutes from the India Gate. Incredibly attentive service and super clean rooms and facilities. The suites are big and beautifully furnished, and top quality amenities are abundantly provided. Breakfast rooms (there are two) offer a great variety of foods and drinks."
"The hotel claims and states to deliver high quality of service but in fact it is inflexible and justifies behaviour as following orders/rules only.    I stayed here with my three children and after a day of touring the kids wanted to play by the pool.  At first, the pool guard said that my son was not allowed to wear a t shirt in the pool as cottons were not allowed.  So we took it off and he protected himself from the sun with sun cream all over.  The children then wanted to have a bit of fun playing by the pool and jumping in (not doing trying to recreate Olympic style diving) and we were summarily told that the hotel does not allow this.  I was watching my children at all times.   The pool was empty and there was no good reason for being so inflexible.  They claim to be"
"trust Taj totally to make it special... last time it was anniversary... this time it was my bday... Taj made it special again... gave me a free upgrade to the Palace wing, which was a dream come true... they had decorated the room... and looking at everything my kids now insist that their bdays be celebrated at Taj only...."
"our stay was made superb - fabulous ambience, brilliant service and great amenities.Spa, pool and the restaurants all throughly recommended. The location is somewhat distant from the hub but we were on holiday - it did not matter. superb views of sea of arabia and gateway of India.Clear expensive but reasonable value for money"
"It is such a beautiful hote and the staff are excellent.  I had no reservations from lunch with my family on holiday from Singapore. On entering the hotel, the staff was so sweet and polite to me when I told her I hv no reservations.  She told me about all the available restaurants and the food provided.  I choose the cafe on the right.  Eric the waiter was excellent - giving us a short history on the food, the location move of the cafe.  We enjoyed the food.  The lamb chops and dessert etc was heavenly.  I was there with family on 8th August 2016.  Thanks Eric."
"Extremely cordial staff, luxurious rooms, perfect hospitality. Food taste not up to the mark.   I visited the hotel on a long weekend and the hotel was completely sold out. There was mad rush in the hotel and even then the staff members were very polite and managed well."
great experience. value for money. look forward to visit other Taj property. I will recommend this hotel for a leisure stay. Staff are very friendly. service is prompt. Book in advance and try different crusine.
"The Taj Palace is one of the best hotels in Asia. Combining luxury, tradition and impeccable service, the hotel consistently provides a 5 star experience. A stay in the Palace wing provides an insight into the history on India. The hotel has an excellent location opposite the Gateway to India and has plenty to see in the surrounding streets.   This report is for the Palace Wing only. The Tower Wing is a more traditional hotel experience."
Excellent service and beautiful property. Relaxing stay. Great service for the breakfast buffet as well as a large selection of choices. Pool area was a relaxing even during the monsoons. Room was well appointed and well maintained
"Stay in Taj Mahal Palace was a memorable experience. Having lived in Mumbai earlier for many years, I always wanted to stay at the Taj Mahal hotel, and this time when I was visiting Mumbai for a day, I booked Taj. Hotel scores 10 out of 10 in all aspects; location, service, food, room comfort, personalized attention, luxury, and so on...   I was given an upgrade to Palace wing and bingo, I was super happy :) Room was marvelous, galley leading to the room chocked me up a bit reminding the attacks in 2008. Hotel conducts a tour in the evening, demonstrating history behind it. I was awestruck after this, and felt so special staying at this place. Pool and spa was good too. Breakfast spread was huge, and food very yummy.   Staff is stupendous and offer impeccable service. They are"
"First-class hotel, the way they used to be and still should be everywhere. Top-notch attentive service, great amenities, great restaurants. Nice choice of shops and overall great value compared to what this type of hotel would cost elsewhere. One of the top 3 places to stay in Mumbai."
What a fantastic place. The staff were fantastic couldn't do enough for you. It was my partners birthday the day we arrived I did not mention it to them but when we got to the room it was full of balloons and a pillow on the bed saying Happy Birthday. About 10 min after we got into a room there was a Knock at the door and someone was  there with a birthday cake. Thank you so much. The room was immaculate the food was perfect so much variety we only had breakfast. I would definitely go back again
"The staff was very friendly. the hotel was very neat. No complains; but definitely Taj needs to stay a notch above the competitors, which they need to work on and improve. The location is actually abit too far from the airport and it took us close to 2 hours to reach the hotel on a weekday after 7 pm. The view of the Gateway from the hotel is obscured by the mosquito net. They should have at least thought of a window type mosquito screen."
"I have never encountered such amazingly attentive customer service like at the Taj Mahal Palace.  Despite the fact that the place is incredibly luxurious, it is not stuffy at all. The staff make it such a warm and welcoming and wonderful place to stay. That's the best thing about this hotel. (Obviously the food is delicious and the rooms are gorgeous too.) "
"We arrived early to check into our much anticipated two night stay at The Taj Mahal Hotel Mumbai! As instructions were given early prior to our arrival, we were given our rooms, but not before we were rudely told we could not sit in the coffee lounge as there was a cover charge, even though we were told by the guest service personnel to do so. Reluctantly the waiter allowed it.... First bad impression. We were booked into a Luxury Grande Room King Bed Seaview - Palace Wing! (Didn't look like the website pictures) with small windows... But yes we could see the Gate of India from our room! I was expecting a little more from the room but oh well...  Shortly after we got to our room, our floor butler came to greet us and offered welcome drinks and said to call ""0"" if we needed his"
"we were there celebratg a milestone bday -2 school friends! taj not only gave us a upgrade(with a voucher] to a suite room WHICH CAME WITH A LOT OF BENEFITS-use of the taj palace lounge for high tea as well cocktail hr but had balloons put in the room,a complimentary bottle of wine, n a lovely cake too! excellent butler service too! to top it all they gave us a late chk out -4pm with use of wifi n taj lounge till i left at 7:30pm!!!! it made our stay sooo special! taj has absolutely lived up to its name"
"Come to the world of Taj, yes the moment you enter this enchanting property and clear your baggage and security  you have entered a new world and experience called as The Taj Mahal Palace  the rarest of experience   The best Bar called the Harbour bar cal for the cocktail which is a special stuff  Amazing breakfast at shamiana  amazing comfortable rooms   do not miss the ancient hotel tour and get to know some amazing facts about the Taj..  come to my home land and my home ground Bombay   please please get in to the Taj and enjoy  you will remember me every moment of lovely experience there"
"First visit to Mumbai, welcoming was great and traditional, check-in process was quick and smooth. The staff are very professional and friendly. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable.  The only observation is that the service doors are very noisy."
"Highly recommend the Taj when staying in Bombay. They have the best service I have experienced anywhere. Any issues, should they arise are swiftly resolved and they are extreemly accomodating. I always look forward to staying there when coming to India."
"Had a wonderful time. Nothing comes close to the overall experience staying in 'The Taj Mahal Palace"". Amazing old world charm with all the modern amenities with a touch of brilliance everywhere. To add to it is the breathless view of the sea with the Gateway standing tall. Ever smiling, courteous, helping staff adds to the overall experience. Beautiful looking food that tastes v nice (though on a little expensive side). In totality, it was one of the best stay's. Hope to visit again soon. Cheers!!!"
"No matter what, you get treated like royalty in this hotel.  That doesnt happen easily.  Behind the scene is a complex network of individuals hard at work, making sure they are catering to every whim and fancy.   I left feeling refreshed and energized."
"Excellent service. Cordial staff who have a smile on their face and always eager to attend to the slightest request. The executive suite in the palace wing where i stayed is spacious, equipped with all the trappings of luxury and the en suite bathroom is large and well-lit. Personalised touches, be it in terms of the magazine you prefer reading, addressing you by your first name and expressing a familiar feeling, exemplary food offerings and the historic building that has a story to tell, just makes it a memorable stay."
"was made extremely comfortable,was attended at all times excellent food the dining experience at wasabi was outstanding the lady in charge was very helpful and helped in making us have the right dishes all in all a remarkable good hotel."
"We chose this hotel for a night of luxury before taking part in the Mumbai to Chennai Autorickshaw rally.  Every detail from check in to departure was a joy.   The food was spectacular. The surroundings were beautiful and the staff were magnificent.  It was our honeymoon and the staff had decorated our room, a complimentary drink and a wonderful chocolate cake was presented to us.  My wife was moved to tears of joy by the care and love that was taken in making our stay so special.  We will visit again and stay for longer.   "
"This hotel blows every expectation out of the water and delivers perfection over and over again in every aspect. I stayed their recently with my wife and 5mth old son.  We were greeted at the airport by the hotel staff and whisked away into the Tata SUV which was very nice. On the way we were discussing dining options with Dyaneshwar - our chauffeur who recommended Souk. Within minutes, he had sorted out our reservation!  A the hotel we were mightily surprised to be upgraded to the incredible signature Maratha Suite in the heritage Palace Wing. Sonia conducted a very smooth checkin in the suite and we were left in awe of the grandeur and the incredible views of the Gateway of India from our suite.  The Jiva spa is just sublime. I had the best massage of my life when I chose"
"My husband and I visited Shamiana for coffee last night ... After a late night movie. It was a trip down nostalgia lane to see the Shamiana back in its original location with an alfresco section , spanking new furniture and a wall of photos of the rich and famous who have visited over the years ...the coffee , desert and service was , as usual, outstanding ...exemplary Taj service . Many other guests were enjoying a late night meal and sampling the food. Well worth a visit to soak in the real Mumbai atmosphere and do some people watching . "
"The hotel is a palace which has modern rooms and traditional corridors and the service has luxury and opulence with warmth. The restaurant near the pool has one of the beat seating and there is a sailing charm at the lounges. The walls have pictures of personalities, heads of state, sport stars and celebrities who have been admirers of thi"
"We stayed a couple of nights during a FIT business trip. Perfect hotel, not far away from center and AirPort . Very friendly and helpfull staff. We had nice vieuw on the ocean. But  you have to face a luxury stay against the poor life outside the hotel"
"one experiences a certain level of pride when one stays at the taj. you really cant better the service , the food , the breakfast the uniqueness of the old wing is intact to this day.   simply charmig"
"Historic and mythic hotel in Mumbai is snobbish and pretentious.  Nice location, beautiful architecture.  Even if this hotel is envied by many it was a disappointment as we felt they were more interested in our money than our wellbeing...  The club lounge is way to small for the capacity of guests they admit.  Food is ok compare with what you can get at others.  We were staying in the oldest part of the hotel... Lobby and public area are very crowded and noisy.  The Club room was nice and comfy and the butler service was inconsistent.  It's more a tourist attraction now than a 5 stars hotel.  "
"I have visited Souk a few times for a meal with colleagues however this is my first time I am writing about the experience on the 4th August. The Food - The food is simply amazing, everything from the Hot and cold Mezze platters (must try the crispy Rubian and kebabs with hummus with pita bread and sitar spice) For the mains we had prawn tagine and pomfret which was music for the senses. For dessert you cannot go past the rose petal ice cream and just when I was feeling guilty about the amount of food I had just consumed, the waiters bring out caramel ice cream, ricotta vermicelli and baklava on the house which was demolished.  The service - The wait staff are extremely professional and really know their stuff. The Taj service and professionalism is something we all now take for"
"As soon as my boyfriend and I got here we got upgraded to a better room overlooking the swimming pool in the main section. The room was amazing and the service was even better! There was an amazing bathtub and they even gave us some nice bubble bath! Really great staff and great breakfast! Obviously the location is amazing, in the midst of Colaba. Highly recommended!"
"I've stayed at a lot of 5 star hotels.  This one sets the bar for all of them.  Well informed, helpful staff you manage to take care of every need without ever being intrusive.  First class F & B and an easy walk to the core south Bombay Colaba shopping areas.  Even if you've no reason to stay there - go stay. Just so you have something to compare every other hotel to."
Lovely hotel.  I had arranged for the hotel to pick me up at the airport.  My driver was excellent. He answered all my questions about the city and pointed out landmarks as we went along.  The check in was smooth and welcoming.  My room was amazing.  Loved the view of the India Gate from my room. Breakfast was delicious with lots of interesting choices.  When I told my waiter that I was enjoying trying foods that I had never eaten before he made sure that I tried an Indian breakfast specialty.  When I expressed how much I loved the baked yogurt he brought the chef over to tell me how to make it.  I took the 5 p.m. tour of the hotel and thoroughly enjoyed learning the history of the hotel.  I cannot imagine a better experience.
Building is suffering from extreme dampness and dry and wet rot. Not good for your young children or even adults who have any sort of breathing disorder. Building should be condemned on health and safety grounds alone.
Nice place to relish the food. From the welcome to the last bite the experience is awesome. The hospitality is great which the name behind the TATA the brand is. Family enjoyed the food. We had the Indian cuisine four course meal worth trying with options available
"On my last leg visiting India I decided to stay here for a night.  There are 2 hotels here - we stayed at the older Taj Mahal Palace which is highly recommended vs the newer wing. The hotel is located right next to the Gateway of India which made for a nice evening walk despite the rain.  You can borrow umbrellas from the bell desk. Right from when you get out of the car you have people helping you with the door, bags, the security check and guiding you to the checkin.  One thing that was weird is you have to go through the newer building to get to the older hotel.    The first thing that hits you is all the beautiful art work.  There is a 40min tour of the hotel at 5pm everyday and we found out there is an art gallery - so make sure you take an hour to visit that - we could not"
"I've been to a few 5 stars in the west, in India and south east. Some of the properties have been opulent & some quite amazing. But NONE can compare with this. The upkeep, the history, the sheer quality of everything from the bath soaps, to the Lenin and the wood in the hotel leaves one throughly spoilt. This is what the gold standard is. The thing that makes the hotel stand out by miles is the staff. They are so warm and so well trained that one feels no less than a King.   For us, our stay at the Palace wing will be one of the most memorable experiences in our lives. "
most beautiful hotel Taj Mahal Palace and great staff. I love this hotel . I am there for a business meeting. Best location and best services . i will surely recommend this hotel without any hesitation.
I Booked this for our first wedding anniversary and truly it was a great experience. The staff are extremely courteous and helpful. You can be rest for sure that nothing can go wrong while you stay here. 
"Taj Palace Hotel is an experience to be relished and cherished. In every way it is more than one can expect. The decor, the furnishings and amenities and the well trained hospitable staff and the excellent food leaves nothing more to be desired. Shall always return to stay here !"
"From the time the greeting team opened my car door on arrival to the time I left following my stay - I was extremely satisfied and happy with my stay.  I must say a particular thanks to the lady who checked me in, initially she explained to me that my room was being prepared and that I would have to wait for 10-15 minutes, she not only kept me informed during this period, but she settled me down at the lounge with beverages and a quick bite to eat!  Once the room was ready - about 8 -10 minutes only she accompanied me and showed me to my room - not only was the room to my liking but my bag arrived very quickly along with another cup of tea!    During my stay, this lady along with all of your staff made me feel very welcomed with their lovely smile and greetings at every"
I had a stay in Taj Mahal Hotel And Taj Lands end In Mumbai. Taj lands end is a much better and reliable property. At Taj Mahal Location And Food Is Seven Star But Service Is Poor. Or Zero. There was no Cleanliness in the rooms. In my room there were LIPSTICK MARKS on the Pillow. I took pics as well. But I was not expecting this especially from Taj Mahal... Better stay at Lands End. Better Property. Only Thing I Liked Was The Location...
"Stayed for the weekend while in the middle of business trip and was thrilled to have chosen the Taj Mahal Palace. Absolutely one of a kind and exceptional in every way.  If you can afford it you must stay in the Palace (old) wing and not the towers. This is the original grand dame of 5 stars hotels and one of the most exceptional in the world. Yes you will find glitzier hotels, on brand new pristine sites but nothing will come close to the perfection here.  The staff are amazing and somehow learn your name and room almost immediately. You are met knowingly every morning at breakfast, your butlers go out of their way to make everything perfect and the food is excellent. It's this that makes this the best hotel I have stayed at ever. They are part of the Taj Mahal Palace family"
"Recommend a must stay with this hotel for every tourist to Mumbai who wants to have a feel of Incredible India. Kids friendly environment, excellent food , best view of gateway and harbour so photographic location. Don't forget to register yourself for Heritage walk in Hotel Lobby , if you want to know more about its rich heritage.  Easily accessible by public or private transport. For shopping fashion market is just nearby."
"Was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the ""Palace"". Beautiful big rooms, spacious bathrooms... nothing short of the spectacular Taj experience. Having left a Taj property in Varanasi which left us less than satisfied, we were pleased to note that this Taj property still ""has it"". After a December 2013 visit, the hotel is still spotless and well worth the title of luxury hotel. However, the choice of food leaves much to be desired especially for vegetarians."
"I had the pleasure of staying at the Taj Palace Hotel in Mumbai and it was lovely. The hotel is a beautiful location in historical building. The Spa and health club were fantastic too. Absolutely recommend the full body massage.  I tested the Indian restaurant and that too was great. The rooms are nicely designed. Do bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper, because the traffic never stops"
As the name suggests it is a palace... situated at the best location in Pune.. a superb attraction for the local as well as travelers... Very good luxury hotel... Professional staff.. Amazing experience... You can thoroughly enjoy your stay and take a wonderful experience along...
Overall a perfect  Heritage Hotel to spend time with your Family. Excellent services and very friendly staff. Good location and luxury comfort!!! Value for money and preferably would like come to back again...
Taj - The Bestest After All . :) We had gone here with Friends to Attend a Very Close Friend's Wedding .The best Hotel i have seen so Far in India  .. Right in front of the Gateway Of India. High-End Luxury Property a Old Palace Refurbished and Kept so Well. The Rooms are a Total Treat - Must Try the Suites..You wouldn't have seen anything better. I rate this as a 7 Star.  100% Points.
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Good location, great service and nice rooms. However, when we were at the hotel the swimming pool was closed (we had been informed on email but only after our booking was confirmed) and there was little for us to do in the hotel considering we were there for the weekend."
"The hotel is immaculately maintained inside (although looking out of my window revealed a pretty weather beaten and decayed exterior). The welcome was good, the room spotless if a little traditional and the view out of its window pretty special - overlooking the Gate of India monument and the sea.  I arrived fresh off the plane from the UK at 2:00am and was met by a room butler. He gave me a cursory intro to the facilities and offered a wake up call. The call never happened and I didn't see him again....."
Wonderful hospitality. You get your money's worth. They make you feel like a celebrity. Very relaxing. Brilliant restaurants inside to eat and get a drink. Must try it. I will definitely stay next time am in town and also recommend it to my friends and family.
"Hotel amenities are excellent. But if If u r business traveller and  short of time, then you need to Plan for ur meals well in advance, since Hotel does not provide Buffet meals and placing order may take time beyond patience. Otherwise for leisure travellers, it's fantastic."
The best part of the hotel was service. All amenities were provided in the room. The Wi-Fi facility was not provided in the room. The activity was arranged by the hotel. I had taken food from the outside of the hotel. The hotel was located in the city. The cab facility was provided at the hotel.
"Its located near the Gateway of India, In one word I can say pure luxury class facilities. It has around 10 dining options for the guests to choose from.Stylishly designed with Indian-inspired interior decoration and architecture, the rooms offers amazing sea, city or pool views. Staffs are friendly and always smiling."
Could not have been more pleasurable and comfortable. The hospitality of the staff left me spellbound. The ambience and  experience was delightful. The grooming and behavior of the staff encountered was exquisite and polite in all respects from the welcoming ceremony till departure from the portico.
"What an incredible way to start our trip to India! We were greeted with such warm hospitality. The Taj Palace is true old world luxury. The service, room and property was like stepping back in the colonial time. Our stay was flawless with a well appointed room that included all the amenities expected from 5-star hotel. The hotel is an art lover's dream. The history and architecture of the hotel are not to be missed.   We had exceptional meals at Souk, the Golden Dragon and high tea at the Sea Lounge."
I was terrified for the people and the historic building on 11/29/08 as the day unfolded. I have visited the hotel since then and they are fully recovered and none of the staff I new were hurt. This hotel is the warmest and nicest hotel I have ever stayed at.
"We went to the Taj Mahal Hotel for food and coffee on multiple days while in Mumbai. Mumbai is a very busy and hot city, so to spend some time in the air conditioned restaurant of the Taj was a delight. The staff are very friendly (although we weren't allowed to use the wifi, as we weren't staying in the Hotel - sad times), and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. We enjoyed great coffee and homemade biscuits during the day, and then went back for chinese(!) in the evening.    It's known that Westerners need to be moderately careful about where what you eat whilst in India, but we had no concerns at all in the Taj."
"This is most amazing property I stayed by far. It gives you the royal feel, if you are staying at the palace side. Choose a room,  Over looking the sea and gateway of India.   Service and food quality is outstanding. Rooms takes you to the past. But the cleanliness and Functional aspect of all gadgets amaze you. It's gives you the history of what happened in the 110 years with gallery photos across many walkway corridor. Great place..."
"I traveled to Mumbai to go to a friends wedding and me and my family stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace, the experience was absolutely delighful! my room was perfect, the food was tasty and the staff was so happy to welcome us! all of those components combined made me feel like a Princess. Taj Mahal Palace is a highly recommended hotel if you are traveling to mumbai!"
"great experience as a whole.very close to india gate and market place ,although the weather was too humid. boat trips next to hotel .all restaurants are nice specially the sushi bar . the staff are very friendly , rooms are comfortable and clean"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a classy, elegant hotel with all amenities that one can imagine. Excellent food, especially the high tea in a warm, service oriented atmosphere. Of course, the location is everything!"
close to shopping on your on at back of hotel.  spa was soooo good.  the lounge serves indian street food at tea time.  delicious and safe to eat.  take the tour telling you about the hotel's history.  you will learn a lot.  the chinese restaurant was so yummy.  try the flambe dessert.  the experience is worth it.  best dim sum.  really!!!!
It's a lovely hotel with amazing architecture. There are two wings and we stayed in the original old wing. The poolside was lovely but wasted on us as it was the monsoon season and it rained every day. The rooms are comfortable; bed is very comfortable. Found the deserted seated areas outside the room a little creepy at night. The breakfast spread is quite decent and a good selection of Indian specialities!
"After a day full of business meetings, I went to have a drink in the bar. Talked for a few minutes to a gentleman there, who left. Later I wanted to leave, was presented the bill, and the drinks of that other gentleman were charged on my bill. I explained that it wasn't my responsibility to pay for his drinks. I was interrogated for half an hour by bar staff: ""don't you know him?""  ""What is your reason for being here?""  ""You should pay for all drinks!"" Etc. Etc. I was treated as a criminal. After half an hour, I was told I could pay for my drink, but my day was ruined, and the next few days I felt terrible! Never in my life I have been treated so rudely. Every time I think back of this, it makes me feel very angry. Horrible experience."
"We have experienced Taj holidays many a times before and each time they set a higher benchmark. Applaud their personal connect that makes them go an extra mile. This time they celebrated my spouse's birthday with surprise room decorations, cake and flowers and wine. Glad to have chosen to stay in Taj for this special day."
good stay. The Buffet breakfast was not as per expectation but not bad. The staff was not able to seated in an organized manner. the Tour was nice the service was good. the toilets dont have sanitary fucets. Indian guests often complain of this issue
It was our first time for my family to come to Mumbai and Taj's hospitality was beyond our expectations.  Staff was extremely accommodating and helped us feel the India culture.  We were treated like queens and kings
The Hotel is located in a most inviting surroundings and one can just sit inside the room or go around the hotel to spend hours and hours without getting bored . A super location and an excellent environment .
"This must be one of the worlds' iconic hotels and it certainly lives up to its reputation. Must say even though the list of guests at this hotel includes royalty, Presidents, Prime Ministers, rock & film stars, the quality of the hotel and its staff is shown by the fact that every single guest is equally important to them so it is more than just a 5 star hotel. As they were doing work on some of the Tower Wing, we were upgraded to the main building ( built in 1908 ) - being shown to our room on the 3rd level you could but admire the sheer opulence - all along the corridors were magnificent pieces of furniture, paintings, sculptures, etc, and our room although very old was in excellent condition with items within the room upgraded to the very latest technology without taking away"
"Taj Mahal Palace has never failed to surprise me with consistently high level of service & amazingly comfortable stay. I've never felt more welcomed in any other hotel, all across the globe! Warm welcome; amazingly pretty and palace-like room; friendly staff at all times. You guys rock, every single time!"
"We live in Mumbai. When we thought of a staycation, we never thought it would be anywhere but the Taj Mahal Palace. We had booked a room at the Tower, but were pleasantly surprised when we were offered accommodation the Palace which was always in our dreams. The stay being in celebration of our anniversary, the hotel decorated the room appropriately with flowers and balloons. They brought us a beautiful and nice Anniversary cake as well. It was an unforgettable experience.  The staff were always very polite and were ever eager to meet any of our needs in quick time. The turnaround time was outstanding. The High Tea, the Cocktails at the Palace lounge were a delightful experience. So was  the breakfast (included) at the Sea Lounge over looking the bay. The food was also very good"
The Ultimate in Old world Charm.. The Palace wing still maintains the Aura of the Past times in every aspect of Service. It was a sheer pleasure the stay. Starting with the traditonal welcome to the room all done in a very warm and freindly style.  We did take a Tour of the Hotel which gave us a insight into the Past. A must have stayed Palace for every traveller to Mumbai.
"I just dropped by this place for a Lunch, its such an amazing place, so many antiques and with a long history. Their food is really good. Service was good and the staff is very friendly. Hotel located in a nice place, perfect location."
"We stayed in a room with a view over the gate to India. Although the room was fairly basic (superior deluxe or something (not the cheapest one), the one that sticks out is really the service of this hotel.  When arriving in the middle of the night (due to deleyed flight) everything was already prepared and we were guided directly to our room, sign the paper and go to bed.  After a day out sightseeing we came back and there was a big copper bowl with salts/herbs and flowers plus an instruction how to prepare it and then relax. Already in the room. There were also small token gifts that they have noticed might fit us.  The staff is always helpful and tries to accommodate you in the best way. Made us really feel welcome and appreciated in a way most hotels have seem to forgotten."
Yes i can say this as special treat on special occasion as it was my anniversary and they ie TAJ made it more special by decorating the rooms. Its true that they know how to handle the special day and its not 1 person each and every person in TAJ was in that to make our day.... Next Day breakfast was also good and rooms are as uaual no need to mention the best.
"We have often stayed at this property at the Taj for a weekend break and hence perhaps we set the bar very high (keeping in mind the other times we have stayed in this and other properties) this much anticipated weekend break. The overall experience was great as usual but it was the smaller things which left much to be desired. Loud conversations on a phone, children running around in the lounge perhaps could have been looked into.  The corner room was lovely but we were not informed not to switch off the air conditioner hence on our return we were welcomed back with rather slippery wooden floors. The dedicated butler hmm lets give it a pass. the Taj Palace has known to exceed expectations (even ours on several occasions) perhaps this was not one of those days."
"We stayed in a Sea View Club room in the Palace Wing. This is a beautiful, grand old hotel, but very much an old hotel. The room and hallways smelt damp and musty, and the place feels tired. The Club Lounge is great with a really positive atmosphere - a great place to relax in.   I think next time we will stay in a more modern hotel that isn't in need of air and repair. "
"had a wonderfull experience,hospitality was amazing,staff's attitude was perfect.lobby manager isha,concierge person mr sandeep and room buttler mr faisal were very help ful and there services were up to mark"
"This is the best hotel in my life when I visit Mumbai in 2015 month of December.  As we reached the hotel we were welcome with a rose bouquet,Check in was quick,Food is very delicious,rooms are very spacious and comfortable. I will highly recommend this hotel "
"There is nothing I could possibly write that is bad about this hotel.  Enjoyable experience.  Perfect location, staff is accommodating and the food is beyond description.  I'll never forget the memorable afternoon tea just sitting in the lobby and watching the world go by."
"A city orientation tour, with the highlight visit for tea at the Taj. And what a highlight -it delivered a splendid example of British India at its best. The hotel established in the early part of the 20th century is majestic in design and location. located at the 'Gateway' to India, with its spiraling staircase evoke the splendour of the Raj. Everyone has stayed here from  Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Mahatma Gandhi , Jawaharlal Nehru, Maharajahs and Princes, Lord Louis Mountbatten, to the Beatles, Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, The King & Queen of Norway, Roger Moore, The Duke of Edinburgh, Hilary Clinton and Roger Moore. Tea of course was marvellous Darjeeling, sandwiches, pastries, -what more could you ask as you luxuriate in history, and five star luxury. One of 'the' hotels in the"
"The stay at Hotel Tajmahal Palace is really a lifetime experience. The decoration, antiques collection, different at every location on every floor is really fascinating. The quality level of service is unmatched. The food is also really tempting.  Please plan to keep atleast one day minimum for exploring the hotel and enjoying it. The photo session will really be memorable."
"Being a  heritage building, care should be taken that all the elements are in tandem with the character the hotel spells especially the room furniture.  The hospitality of the Taj is well maintained and The restaurants have an unsurpassable ambience and excellant spread of traditional and international cuisine."
"I stayed here for 4 days and I loved it - the history, location, ambiance, STAFF, food,  ambiance, view from my room of the Gateway to india, and the SPA!!!   I would be out and about during the day in marvelous, chaotic Mumbai, come back to The Taj and  be greeted by a gracious staff and lovely fruits and pastries in my room.  The treatments at the Jiva Spa are spectacular.  I did a combination 120 minute Indian Signature treatment - Vishram aromatherapy and the Anana Lepa Facial.  Best  massage and facial I have ever experienced.    The Taj is Mumbai and Mumbai is the Taj...  There is a quiet elegance about the hotel that stays with you long after your visit."
"Been here for business trip for a day or two....awesome service,  great ambience, great food, amazing view from the suite....best for business trips...helpfull staff in service...plan ur entire day as location is great..."
"The place internalizes guest preferences, within the domains of the possible, in the system. High standards and careful delivery marks much of the Hotel's effort. There may be very minor areas of possible improvement but the over all service quality more than compensate any Nano-deficiencies of space and steps"
"Being in the hotel feels proud. Received very warm welcome by the staff. The best thing I noticed about Taj is, there is absolutely no discrimination in their service in between VIPs and common people like us. We had been in one of their cafes called Shamiyana. We did not expect French fries at not that costly price of Rs. 200/- :-)  Overall a fabulous experience !"
This is the best hotel in my life when i visited mumbai in 2015 december i was shocked i didnt enjoyed the city but i loved the hotel the most every thing is great service rooms everything i love the hotel
"I had a great stay at the famous Taj Mahal Palace hotel with my family. The place is pure luxury living. The hotel is veri big and beautiful. We were 10 members. We booked 3 rooms. The hotel is very near to the Gateway of India. Many brand showrooms are also there. The staff and security was very cooperative. If anyone wants to have a luxury stay , then this place is the best. The ambiance was extraordinary. I want to come here again. My 3 days and 2 nights trip was full of exitement , fun , and comfortable stay. "
"I enjoyed my stay in the very central Taj Hotel in Bombay. For first the location is great, maybe the best that you can get in Mumbai. The hotel is a signature hotel in town and it is always very crowded. I have to say that the room are not that big and the bathroom definitely small. However the service was good and breakfast very good. The hotel has great facilities and a stunning pool. Definitely i suggest to give a try to the hotel, in particular for the location."
"this is one of the famous exquisite east facing sea facing oldest hotels give panoramic view of Arabian sea, Elephant a Caves.  I never forget my stay in this fantastic beautiful scenic beauty colaba.."
"I have stayed here before, but this was a first time in the Palace (heritage) wing. Great room, with a floor butler to sort our needs. Particularly nice was free use of the Palace lounge, although our room didn't include the daily drinks and snacks buffet this could be added for only 1300Rs however you could get soft drinks, tea and coffee all day for free in this opulent lounge.   Do try high tea in the Sea Lounge, very colonial , although the clotted cream could be better the rest is stunning.   "
"The place was very nice, clean and enjoyable.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Free WIFI is provided all over the hotel which wasn't earlier during my last visit in 2014.  The breakfast was excellent as there was large variety of food.  I came to know in my last day that food from outside the hotel is not allowed which I believe that it should not be and the guest should have the choice."
"The hotel is beautiful. Lots of heritage and character but modern finishes and comfort. We loved the pool, breakfast, all the restaurants were good and the location was perfect. The staff were all very friendly and nothing was a problem."
The hotel is very comfortable.  The staff is very accommodating/courteous and treated me as if I was the only guest in their hotel.  I felt secure at all times.  There are several options for food and was able to find something for all of my team members to eat.
"Fabulous hotel great location very clean great staff. We were upgraded to the palace from the tower,( didnt see tower room). Our room was lovely, had birthday celebration and had balloons, flowers and cake in the room, nice touch.  Only ate twice in hotel in the evening as expensive, however Breakfast was lovely with a huge choice of Indian food or bacon and eggs, cakes and fruit, and an amazing view of the Gateway ( should you get a window table!).  the  pool was lovely, and the pool boys were very attentive, (could have done with a few more sun beds spent a few afternoons lying on the grass! ). the staff were always smiling and happy to help, but there was no pressure to tip them.  Be aware of the taxes that get added on to the bill at the end!!  We had a fabulous time here,"
"ENJOYED POOL SIDE CAFE. Nice ambience. Impressed with Traditional Welcome with Aarti & Garland.  It's excellent location just facing Gateway of India. Throughout stay, one can find immense hospitality. Harbour Bar is the first bar of Mumbai with license No. 1 having wonderful stock of large collection of all sorts of liquor."
" My kids and I simply loved our stay here. The staff are the best, each and every one of them. We had the pleasure to spend a few extra minutes with Husain Mohammed (Assistant Housekeeping Manager), he was so kind, helpful and willing to make our stay enjoyable. Thank you Taj Mahal Palace staff."
"Staff professional, warm and attentive to needs.  Food in Indian and Lebonese restaurants excellent.  Experience great overall, unfortunately did not have a chance to utilize the pool facilities.  However the patio area was fully utilized."
"Good place to do some professional business meetings where you can take your business friends and clients for luxury stay & food, staff service excellent, beautiful rooms, historic hotel where you will get friendly service. It seems like home."
"great hospitality at taj mahal palace  - top notch service standards - right from check in to check out - great experience all through but for the food at masala kraft. we were upgraded to sea view rooms and also provided late check out - the sea view rooms during monsoons have a different charm altogether - it was a weekend break and was quite worthwhile - as the hotel does not have a kids' play area they were offered puzzles and soft toys to keep them busy - probably the hotel should also have a small portion of the large pool converted into a kid's pool - the heritage tour is worth taking - we had dinner at masala kraft and must mention that it was pretty disappointing - the breakfast experience at shamiana however, was quite good - we had a pretty good time overall."
"I have stayed one night  like all 5 stars hotel in India, you can always expect great service that you can hardly find anywhere in the world!  The hotel is old but very well maintained. The reception team is just great! I used the transfer in and out, worth every  cent, I paid around 5000 INR , internet in the vehicle a Tata car, that was fantastic. I would like to make a special comment about Ravi from the transportation desk, that made everything possible to solve my traveling transportation issues. I low point is the breakfast restaurant, they are under staffed, not so well prepared, the space is not dimensioned  to take all guests. I would suggest an immediate review of this issue since it can be very damaging for the hotels reviews. I had to wait 20 minutes while many table"
"TAJ, the word itself describes the Royalty that we are going to experience, The staff are very kind enough in all the aspects. Its a very good experience over all and wish to stay there more and enjoy the palace beauty with its amazing interiors and ambience. Over all its a perfect place to stay in."
"Just back from a weekends stay at the Taj. Started with a happy upgrade to the club floor palace. What a fab room - only drawback - my room did not have a bath tub which is high preference for my daughter. Besides that - high tea at the Lounge, brunch at the shamiana, cool dip in the beautiful pool and exceptional service ! Special shout out to Hussain Mohammed - head of housekeeping on the 6th floor. Took great care of us and the children and attended to every minute / silliest of requests that we had. Thank u Hussain.  A mind blowing experience at the Taj, the ambience sweeps you off your feet and The impeccable service ensures your presence back at that Hotel very soon! Thank you red_heart"
"very luxurious, staff service excellant, rooms beautiful, historic hotel, freindly service catering for all your needs, good dining, iconic, well worth staying even if its only for the one night, the hotels is as good inside as it looks from outside."
"No warning from desk that a wedding was celebrated on saturday night Result : vibrations all night long, until 5:30am I go to palace for details and luxury experience but my room was not prepared in the evening. It was a disappointed experience..."
"This hotel along with the Gateway to India, in front of this hotel, is perhaps the prime tourist attraction in Mumbai.  Staying at this beautiful historical colonial style luxury hotel is like stepping back in time to the hay-day of the British Raj, an amazing experience, full of colonial charm and character.  The common areas, bars and pool area are exquisite.  The hotel is a historical oasis from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai. Service was great.  The rooms are modern and well appointed.  Try to stay in the heritage wing if you can.  This is the place to stay in Mumbai, I highly recommend it."
Super organised and well maintained and really good good observations it takes me a good Good Feeling for my family and the taste of this disses love it The hotel is so beautiful and so big here and there many people are enjoying with their family and very 3D speaking with each other and then enjoy with each other
A momentous stay in Mumbai at the Taj Palace.  The food was amazing and the comfort of the room a delight too.  It enabled my trip to be relaxing and also the location helped with the free time I had to explore the city.  Thank you to all staff who were always helpful and professional.
When u go the hotel area and you see the beautiful gate way of india and it's just opposite to it and itself is a magnificent palace. Tata has really made a palace to show :).  So basically there are two wings in the hotel palace and tower wing. The rooms in palace was much more expensive then but we were staying for one day only so decided to book palace. Walk in was not allowed so we booked our palace room from makemytrip at Rs20000/-. The lobby was full of guests as a marriage was going on. I visited the hotel with my dad. I asked for a sea facing view room but they didn't had any but they upgraded our room to suite so that was a good thing. One person escorted us to our room who was really nice and told us many things about the hotel too. We changed and went to take dinner
The hotel is within a 5 minute walk from Gateway of India and is also close to marine drive. It has a very beautiful architecture . One can take advantage of free valet parking. Overall it was a good experience.
"How can i describe my feeling......Its always been amazing experience & proud feeling to stay at Taj, Especial, When Taj took initiative & celebrate my wife's birth day by surprised Gifts & Decoration, Its make our day Unforgettable.  Thank U By Heart,   If will get chance to share pics than will sure share some pics of our special days special moments."
"This hotel is huge and the hospitality is just as great in staff care and service. The food is fantastic and the choice of rooms is vast. The location is near the main attraction of Mumbai with more than enough to do by feet, boat or taxi. The security is just right to make you feel safe and important."
Really its a class  Maturity in dealing  Sincerety for service Feeling for guests Everything more than xpctation Bakery was best Palace lounge is superb Value for status  Appericiate & congrts the management  Nxt time will surely try TAJ airport As we used to stay at sahara
"This summary of our stay on Sunday 10 July is an example of ""difficulty at the beginning usually means ease at the end."" When we arrived, the hotel lost our bag and later we found out the bag was actually sent to the wrong room. We waited in 1009 for an hour for them as they kept calling to confirm delivery.  Also, my passport (which was taken at the front desk) took just as long to be returned…the leather cover of the passport also had my credit cards inside the back flap, so that was not a good feeling. Then, we were given a queen bed, instead of what we pre-paid for on Expedia, which meant a smaller room. And actually, it was more like a tiny, dingy corner room of the hotel. I also want to say that when we visited the Taj Mahal in Agra on a weekend, a month ago at the start"
"The hotel experience of a lifetime! Everything was perfect and dinner was outstanding. We were given a complimentary glass of champagne and the claret was decanted in a silver gun carriage. Our outstanding meal was complimented by a sliver salver bearing an array of chocolates.  This was delivered to us by a waiter magnificently dressed in traditional Indian dress, enveloper in a cloud of steam from dry ice. The pianist at the grand piano played my wife's requests from 'The Phantom of the Opera' Unbeatable!"
"Tata - India's biggest and most successful conglomerate and also the name behind TAJ The experience was lived upon to the name , It was extremely lavish and the stay was very comfortable , The staff felt like family was there within seconds after a call and was always serving with a smile , With the hotel being located right opposite the arabian sea , one can expect an eye refreshing view and can be a fun filled trip with the whole family"
"I stayed at the Taj Palace wing during my trip. The service, cleanliness, professionalism was beyond compare. They are head-and-shoulders above other major 5 star hotels I stayed and dined at during my trip. I have recommended this hotel to my friends already :)"
This has got to be the best hotel in Mumbai. Service - Excellent Restaurants - Excellent Staff - Excellent Rooms - mine was excellent Position - on the harbour front - excellent Pool - A tropical oasis - excellent
"In South Mumbai, TAJ is a Symbol of LUXURY.  Situated opposite the GATEWAY of INDIA, and Built at the beginning of the 19th Century, the Hotel stands out and can be called the CROWN of the CITY.  The TAJ Palace is a grand old Building and can be compared to the large palaces of kings which are now being converted to Hotels in Rajasthan.  The entry is a warm affair. We were welcomed by lovely executives who followed the Indian Tradition of the red tikka which is the pride of Indians and a tulsi necklace.  We then were escorted to the front desk at the Palace and the check-in was a smooth and pleasing affair with Ms. Amrita and others trying their best to make us comfortable. Aftyyer check-in, we were escorted to the room which was a grand one overlooking the Gateway of India, and"
Go there.  Please.  Go there.  An experience not to be missed. A beautiful hotel with attentive and thoughtful staff in a picturesque area of old Mumbai.  No better way of starting or renewing visits to India.
"I visited the hotel after a long time and was there for a good 5 days what can I say the hotel be it housekeeping , room service the service was excellent , the hotel staff makes you feel like god what a service no doubt this hotel is a icon of India. I was always looking if I could find a fault but I regret I could not find any."
"A great hotel with exceptional service and staff.  It's extremely secure and in a very convenient location.For first time visitors, Mumbai takes a little adjustment due to the sheer volume of people, traffic and background noise, but this is not unusual in most major cities around the world. Our suite was roomy, with separate office and dining, perfect for hosting business meetings/dinners."
nothing new about it ... its like a palace infront of indian gate with some restraunts and food... the nice place worth exploring is the outdoor seating cafe &rest. however they have this resident only policy and wont accept u in even if u want to pay ... the attitude of the waiters is bad too and somewhat rude
"Get hotel, great amenities, but they only give you one key so basically you all have to stay together if you stay in the hotel, and they currently don't let ANYONE do a 3 person room so good luck with making that happen. But other than that it's beautiful and great"
"It's a must see in India, still it is a very contradictory place. Be aware of guides, thieves, photo takers and beggars. For ladies, to cover as many will be looking to you as they have never seen a woman before. Cars are allowed to a place, 20 min far from the Taj, then you will have to walk on a dirty road, where constructions are made and a lot of sewage water flowing. Smell is bad. Very long queue for Indians as they pay Rs 50. Foreigners as they pay 20 times more, get to skip the line. But your ticket from authorized office. You will get a real ticket and a complimentary shoe wear and a bottle of water. Inside its lovely, Tomb is simple inside that you might wonder: is that it? Don't miss the river view on the back.  If you have short time or don't want to spend on the"
I visited to Taj few months ago and believe it's nothing but a dream come true. A luxury at its best and a delightful experience of being there. Had a great day and delicious food served by great humans. 
"Hospitality is not just about putting on a show, its about going out on a limb from genuine concern. Over 8 years, I've enjoyed a stay at the Palace on almost 9 occasions. Conferences and booking in fellow visiting physicians has been especially central to my association with the Taj. The guests have enjoyed genuine care and empathy especially when in Mumbai for recovery.  Two families I know were at the Taj on the night of the terrorist atrocity - I was humbled by the accounts of both families - the guests received complete priority by the staff guests in leaving the premises amid the crisis.  Kudos to that moment of service."
The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is by far the best hotel experience I have ever had. Great historical hotel plus the greatest staff you could ask for. Super location adjacent to the Gateway to India. Terrific views. All staff were exceptional. Ershan and Dinesh G at breakfast in the Sea Lounge were wonderful and make you feel special.
"Just arrived today OMG been upgraded already and we were in the palace wing. We have two butlers day and nights.just having high tea and loving it. I don't get emotional however what a great hotel and family service no hairs and graces just nice people enjoying a great time. Oh and the pool great however was raining, my wife reminded me it is the monsoon season. You wouldn't know it from all the smiles around, what a great life."
"Right from the entry till exit, you have the courteous staff greeting and guiding you at each step. It's the exceptional hospitality, coupled with inexplicably regal and grand look & feel of the property that sets it apart from the rest. Indubitably the best experience ever. Highly recommended!!"
"We recently stayed in this hotel.  Wow!!!  We have stayed in many iconic hotels around the world.  This was a standout in terms of service, friendliness and understated elegance.  Our twelve year old daughter experienced her birthday at The Taj and Sophia and the staff at The Sea Lounge could not have been more welcoming and gorgeous with their special birthday celebrations for her.  Our evening 'foot bath' offered by the butler on the Palace Wing was divine after a day walking around this special city."

"We had our annual staycation at Taj Palace Mumbai recently  and the experience was superlative. The team is par excellent and the service is just perfect. We had a fabulous time - watching the rain as it approaches the harbour and waves lashing on the sea front at Gateway of India was mesmerising and an experience in itself. Taj Palace Mumbai makes you fall in love with Mumbai all over again. And Chef Dipika serves up a fantastic breakfast at Sea Lounge and Chef's Adil high tea is just perfect. The Taj have employed these very smart and cheerful speech and hearing impaired staff members - it was a pleasure interacting with them. Ramneet, Dipika, Beauty and the entire team at Taj made our stay so special. Another call out to the Taj for retaining their old staff - it adds a charm"
"Excellent stay in Taj Mahal Palace recently. Got upgraded to the Palace wing after a hatchet job from Jet Airways at getting me from Delhi and it was wonderful! Awesome location right where you want to be and incredible history. Like staying in a museum and the staff were incredible. They really have that five star service which suggests this is the flagship of the Taj group.   If you can get upgraded or can upgrade to the Palace wing it is definitely worth it. The tower is cool and fine, but it's a modern, more business guest-focused hotel, so just be aware that its not the tower of the palace, but a 1970s eyesore bolted onto the Palace. it's nice inside though!  The palace wing gives you palace privileges to the lounge, restaurant and amazing pool (it's really incredible)."
"we were upgraded from tower wing to Palace , the stay was awesome the service and the feel was not less than a palace. the arrangements made for my son who is just 9months old were too good.... the staff was humble and very cooperate Anyday will suggest this Palace for the kingdom stay"
Excellent place. Very good services. Beautiful place with many options of food.  Very close to gate of india. Security works very well. Everytime someone is wiling to help you somehow. I would definitely go back.
"In the busy city of Mumbai this hotel is a welcome oasis. As soon as you walk through the doors it feels like home. Great restoration of a beautiful historic building. Staff are wonderful and the rooms are excellent. Big bathrooms and rooms with everything you need while traveling for business. The staff on the desk recommended the best restaurant for dinner and we're always helpful. Sushi restaurant in the hotel is also amazing. Best sashimi I have had outside of Japan, the chef told us they have it flown in from the Tokyo market daily. Look forward to staying here again. "
"Be it a leisure trip or business, Taj Mahal Palace is meant to take care of you at each step and every minute. An experience which no other hotel can provide. Certainly the best staff, services and amenities a guest would want. Its the people of Taj that make it a great place to stay."
"very nice experience during our visit to taj ( wel come ) group in Mumbai. Also it""s location & heritage  side building unbelievable. WELCOME AT TAJ GROUP IT WAS NICE . WE ALSO LIKE TIGHT SECURITY AT ENTRY POINT . WE ALSO LIKE IT'S CORRIDOR  ."
Excellent place to stay for enjoying luxury and warmth. From check in to check out   personal attention at its peak. Each guest is looked after with care and concern. Beautiful location and architecture.
"Had a thoroughly enjoyable weekend stay at this iconic hotel set amidst the best views in Mumbai overlooking the Gateway of India. Room was upgraded to the Palace Wing with a Sea View. Welcoming staff, super service and friendly staff made for a hugely enjoyable experience. Thanks"
"Perfect location to explore South Bombay (SoBo): the most iconic monumets like the Gateway of India, peculiar spots like Colaba Causeway Street Market, Dhobi Ghat and the Drying Fishyard, as well as the most trendy restaurants and bars of SoBo altogether."
After travelling around India I decided to spend three days in Mumbai before returning to London. I checked into the Taj Palace and immediately saw why so much is said about it. Beauty and cleanliness is achieved by many establishments but the Taj just seems to be in a class of its own. The service is charming and not intrusive. You feel welcome and wanted! After three nights I felt relaxed and rested.
"We felt honored to stay in such a beautiful and historic hotel.  For a fine world class hotel, it refuses to be snobby.  The facilities and staff are so warm and elegant, even a retired school teacher like me felt comfortable with the attention to detail.  I would certainly recommend the experience of staying there to anyone."
"Great service as in better than everywhere else, stunning architecture coupled to time travel make for a memorable and wonderful experience  Location has provided stunning dawn shots across the water and within days Will and Kate clearly enjoyed the same experience This is like going back to. Hercule Poirrot novel complete with decadence  "
"It was an impromptu visit with my friend here, and I should say we were very impressed. From interiors to the rooms, to the elevators, to the fans in the corridors there was a touch of ' a class apart' feel in everything there. The staff there is an epitome of graciousness and courteousness. You are pampered left right and centre and it makes you think, this is how heaven would be like. Couldn't visit wasabi since it was full. I had always wanted to visit , maybe next time. The breakfast buffet was quiet an elaborate affair, and it was amazing to see that all the staff, from the servers to the head chef come to you and enquire about your needs. Truly a blissful experience. Waah Taj!"
"We were very impressed. After 22 days touring North India staying in 1 and a half star accommodation, this was bliss. Every member of staff treated us exceptionally well, nothing was too much trouble. The king size bed was amazing. Highly recommended. "
"Worldclass experience and amazing team, Our kid was taken care of very well.  Also amazing view of GateWay from the room. Breakfast had great and healthy options, Had a good HorseCart Ride, and it was also raining but Hotel took care of it by giving Umbrellas to all guests. Overall had a good time."
"Its a quite long time we visit there. Place was excellent. Me and my wife, we both enjoy there. The outside temperature was not very good as we went there during summer time. But overall we enjoy there so much."
"Be forewarned. I booked an extended stay, then worked with a travel agent who told me to cancel so that we could travel more extensively throughout India rather than stay in one spot. I tried to cancel over two months before my stay, and the hotel would not let me. Charged me full price to cancel that far in advance. Do not book this place. If your plans have to change you will be very, very sorry. No exceptions."
"Extraordinary hospitality, great breakfast. Mumbai's best food at the golden dragon served with care and more care. Do experience this ONCE In your visit to Mumbai.Breakfast was great and sea lounge is the best place for a quiet scenic tea and snack in Mumbai."
"It was my first time staying at this amazing hotel and i was highly impressed. The decor was very refreshing when i entered the hotel lobby. One of your representative escorted me from the reception till the room and tole me all the logistics and functions, that was unique. Overall, a great experience :)  Stayed June 2016, travelled on business"
"This was the first hotel we stayed during our trip to India and it was a magnificent experience. We arrived late in the night and were upgraded to the palace wing of the hotel. The property is fabulous. The staff are superbly trained and took care of all our requirements with a smile on their face. The Golden Dragon restaurant is something I would recommend everyone who is travelling to Mumbai. We took the hotel heritage tour which lasts 45 minutes in the evening, very informative and fun and our tour-guide Tara was great. The limo city tour which the hotel arranged for us is very good. I can go on and on about our experiences, the fact is just book your next holiday at the 'Taj' and experience it as it is truly the best hotel in the world. This is one to savour for a lifetime."
"As most of you know, sometimes it is a pain to travel to far off getaways for a two day trip with kids puking in the car and packing all kinds of luggage. We reach the destination after a six hour journey or so only to spend the night and the next day we have to be off again. This time we decided to do something different. We had a three day weekend and wanted to live in style yet travel for the least possible time. The Taj Mahal Palace has always been one of the hotels I have wanted to live in, especially after visiting their Madikeri property(see my review). So what if the hotel was a bit expensive? We would save money on fuel, flight and we would save a whole amount of time; we justified ourselves. Turned out it was the best decision ever! We stayed from the 26th to 28th Feb"
"Just had to share our experience with the Head of Security at The Taj. We popped in to have breakfast in the Shamiana restaurant, which by the way has the most devine Eggs benedict and fresh juice. Although a little pricey 3200 ruppees for both of us, we decided to 'shout' ourselves. Once we walked back to our own hotel, we discovered that my husband had lost/dropped/misplaced his Iphone 6. We ran the hotel asking them to please check the table in the restaurant, while we did a find my phone check. The Head of Security not only went himself to check the table and ask the staff there, he also checked the CCTV cameras. We eventually found the phone, in one piece and not damaged (it must have fallen out of hubby's pocket as we traced it to outside of the hotel on the street!!).  "
"Dear friends, if you wanna live the experience of the charme of Old India, you can't miss a stay in this Hotel. This is not just an hotel, this is The Hotel. History itself has steppeed through its doors."
"The service quality is top notch from the time we checked in and checked out.  The food quality is also wonderful - Masala Kraft (the best Indian resto we had),  Sea Lounge (try the High Tea), Harbor 1933 bar (never leave without trying the drink), and Smaniana where breakfast is superb - dishes are rotated everyday.   What makes The Taj Mahal Palace special is its location - the hotel in itself is history, and just beside The Gate of India.  We booked at the Tower Wing but will stay at the Palace wing next time."
First ever stay at Taj Mahal Palace and turned out to be  our most memorable stays. Great work by TAJ team for offering customer delight as always. Special mention to Ms Isha (Reception) for the service given.
"Our final night in India was spent in the absolute luxury of the Taj Palace. We were given a free upgrade to a room overlooking the Gateway to India.  From the moment we entered, to the moment we left, we were treated as royalty. The level of service is impeccable, as is the attention to detail. Yes it's an expensive hotel compared to normal Mumbai prices, but for a complete luxurious experience, it's certainly worth it!"
I stayed in the hotel from 19th to 23rd of June 16 on a business trip. The location of the hotel is very good.  The food is very nice . The staff is verycourteous and welcoming. They take every care to make the stay comfortable.   Overall I had an excellent stay there which I would cherish in time to come.
"We stayed here for a night. Ofcourse its at the best location possible and very luxurious. The staff is extremely warm which is the USP.   On a personal basis, we faced 1-2 issues which were so unwanted in an otherwise perfect stay.  We found a hair in the methi theplas in the morning breakfast buffet..now should one ignore this one off instance coz its TAJ or its a serious thing coz its TAJ is what one has to think about.  The hotel staff uses the term O (alphabet) in place of Zero...which is so demeaning as its a trend started by UK as they dont want to use zero..coz it was discovered by an Indian...not many will understand the feelings behind my writing this. But if the hotel understands and is so proud of being an Indian flagship then it should start using Zero instead of O"
"Its truly an experience to stay at this hotel. you can feel the history in every step. you can sense luxury in every corner.  rooms are a bit cramped and depending on your room, you have to walk a long way. Cant complain much. it was a super stay, one of the best i have stayed."
"Walking distance from Mumbai’s finest shops and restaurants, this luxury property is therefore ideal.  No other hotel in town has this combination of comfort and location. The hotel itself is beautiful - you must treat yourself to one of the Palace Suites, they're incredible. The bathrooms are beautiful. I left wanting to remodel mine to mirror the one we had at this property! As with all Taj hotels, the service was incredible. One thing to note, however, is that the hallways outside of the rooms are not air conditioned.  We were there during a warmer time of year (pre-monsoon) and this makes for a very uncomfortable walk between your room and the lobby or dinner.  All the tine you spend fussing over your hair and getting ready…..by the time you reach your table, your make up is"
"This iconic property, has such dedicated staff, right from Housekeeping to every waiter in every restaurant. People care for you, and understand your need. The property is a heritage property, and they have managed and provided all modern amenities, still with the looks of heritage. If you want to spend a bit more and have a real memorable stay, this is the property."
"Had a great experience at the Taj Palace celebrating my wife's birthday. Kids had so much fun. Pool was excellent. Kudos to the staff at Taj for making our stay a memorable one. Guess, the chaos at the entrance and valet parking can be improved and comfortable for the guests."
"Im on birthday on 21 June 2016 while I stay in this Hotel. so many surprise I received from Hotel Management. Im so happy , my wife too. Thanks to the hotel management for the gift and best wishes on my Brthday."
"We went to Taj Palace to enjoy weekend and monsoon. Team Taj made our weekend wonderful. Excellent service.  I am a brand ""Taj"" lover. I guess this is because of personal attention, touch and care provided by Taj Hotels."
"Its the best hotel with un beatable Hospitality, and the perfect place to rejuvenate and relax your mind.   My words cant describe the experience. this time it was my 4th stay and everytime it keeps getting better and better."
"'THE' finest place to stay in INDIA! The comfort, luxury - everything possible what comes in to the mind of a customer is fulfilled. It is fulfilled without even asking! Without any doubt, it is the finest property of INDIA!"
its been a great experience at TAJ Hotel. Always its best at its services and amenities. great view from hotel and find a very lucrative place to stay in Mumbai. We stayed here for a week and this was my first stay and everything is just fabulous.
Excellent service - couldn't ask for more. But they use roadside parking . Wouldn't recommend anyone giving their expensive car to the valet as they end up parking very tightly on the road side. Recipe for some scratches and bumps
I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace with my family and my Parents for one night.  It was a wonderful experiance.  I got upgrade to Palace by paying nominal extra amount.  Never seen such hospitable and courtious staff.  Very senstive to our needs and helpful.
"This Hotel is a must stay. I will specially recommend it for fellow Indians. There are many other good Indian hotels but this Taj Mahal Palace Hotel at Apolo Bunder, Mumbai is best of the best..If one can visit in rains, that will be an additional plus point."
We stayed here for a weekend away from home. This was our third stay at the property and everything was just fabulous.  We stayed at the Palace Wing on the 6th floor. The room was large enough for our kid to crawl around and expend his energy. The room was plush as expected with quaint furniture and modern amenities. The bed was very cushy and comfortable much to our kid's delight. The room isn't fully sound proof but that wasn't a worry at all.   What sets this hotel apart is the service. Everyone right from the front desk to bell desk to restaurant staff are warm and polite and want you to be taken care of.   We ate at the Golden Dragon where the food was great. The scoop of ice cream on the house as dessert was a great touch. The breakfast at the Sea Lounge was luxurious. The
"I do have a bias towards the Taj for the hospitality of their people. This hotel, the staff do tend to veer towards the ones on their palace hotels. Slightly more foreboding to keep guests private I guess. The view is to die for. This is an experience more than a hotel "
I and my wife stayed at the Taj on a weekend gateway.  We were extremely satisfied with the way the staff pampered us during our stay.  The food was excellent and the staff was very polite and helpful.  We had a great breakfast and overall our stay was memorable.
"Being a global traveller for work, I can confirm the level of attention to detail you receive at The Taj is second to non. If you can spare the extra money stay at the Place Wing. The sense of history and granduar is truly fabulous.  The Taj Palace  is my first choice when in Mubai."
"I am impressed by this landmark luxury hotel in mumbai, it looks opulent both inside and outside.  The story sounds more tantalising for me. An Idian wealthy man was rejected entering the hotel cos he is indian, while his western friends all enter... He was very angry and decided to build this first luxury hotel as the first indian to do so. I am very much touched by the story."
"There is nothing to beat the excellence of a Taj Hotel! Food, service, cleanliness, warmth, care and attention to details. And the original at the Gateway of India tops the crown - always a pleasure to submit oneself to the Taj extravaganza!"
One of the best hotels in the world.Everything is just flawless. Got the opportunity to stay at the tower wing which has some amazing city view. Had the breakfast at the Sea Lounge with the sea n gateway view..Bit expensive but worth every single penny
One of my best stays. Awesome hotel. Great service. Food was awesome. Variety of restaurants. Beautiful spa facilities. Super clean swimming pool. Staff friendly and go out of their way to assist. Rooms are clean and spacious.  Bathrooms beautiful.
"This is so famous that it needs no introduction. It is one of the attractions of Mumbai. Grand in all respects, it is one of it's kind . On the seacoast, the hotel has an unparalleled advantage advantage  from the point of view of accessibility and business activity. It has a prestige value amongst other things ."
"Excellent rooms & service. Staff was very polite and patient and helpful. We were given a room, next to which a room was being painted. This was causing distress due to turpentine smell. On complaining within a few minutes we were given another room and even upgraded. The staff was concerned about our health. That was very much appreciated by.us.   Rooms were clean , linen was well laundered. Room service was excellent."
"The Taj Mahal Hotel is absolutely beautiful, considering part was rebuilt it is very in-keeping and done seamlessly without noticing.  Every thing about it is very grand, we were very fortunate to be upgraded and the room was superb with a view over the swimming pool.   Staff were lovely and very accommodating. The hotel itself is right opposite the gateway of India with easy access to the ferry that takes you over to Elephanta Port.  Food and cocktails are delicious and even though seem expensive compared to the rest of India, it is just the equivalent of prices you pay in the UK. Their massages are very good- Advise to book in for one as soon as if you have limited time. The sun loungers get taken very quickly but there is ample space on the lawn to lay out and relax. Lovely"
"Pleasant stay, excellent restaurants with great views.  Could upgrade services and food quality to compare with Oberoi and other 5 Star properties.  Location is great- excellent for tourists visiting Mumbai to savour the historical relics."
We stayed one night at the Tajmahal hotel in the old wing. The Hotel is just superb and the service was excellent. One can get spoiled by the ambience and the service. We had dinner at the Golden Dragon which was excellent. The quality of food and the service we experienced was excellent. I would recommend any one to go to thTaj and have a dinner at GoldenDragon.
"Came here for a drink after a long hot day wandering around the sights, sounds and smells of Mumbai.  Coming into the cool air-conditioned environs of this hotel was welcome for my small party of four travellers, and after a nose around the public areas of this - frankly - spectacular hotel (honestly, check out the staircase...) we repaired to the ground floor bar.  We sat at window seats that faced the Gateway To India, which really is not a bad view (!) and ordered drinks.  Beer I hardly need explain to you, other than it was cold and precisely what was required.  The cocktails deserve a bit more.  A variety were tried, all of which were excellent.  But you really ought to try a Bombay Blazer.  Served and created at the table, this gin based cocktail was spectacularly flamed"
Went to taj mahal hotel while having a tour of the city and got mesmerized by the beauty. At one side there is this large hotel and on other side gateway of india and besides that a large sea. The place was also good as we had some snacks at one of the restaurants on ground floor. Overall had good time
"This is one stay I have enjoyed and will remember it for my life. The entire stay of one day is memorable experience. I would prefer to be in the TAJ hospitality always. There is no fault of any kind that can be found in any of the services, room, food, or any other"
"I have been staying in four star and five star hotels for past few years but my family and I had an amazing experience during our stay with Taj Mahal Palace and Towers.  We were there to celebrate our daughter's 10th birthday and needless to stay, it turned out to be her best birthday celebration. Each of the team in TMPT contributed highest possible way to make her birthday special right from the moment we checked in till the time we left the hotel.  Truly, we all were overwhelmed with the warm hospitality of TMPT staff. It's a definite recommendations to our friends."
It's a very wonderful experience...  Amazing  No words can describe my super duper stay with The Taj.. I feel like a home.  Staff and services are too good.  Thanks from bottom of my heart.  Delicious breakfast..  Testy food.  I give 1000 out of 100
"Being in Mumbai, never really stayed at the Taj, though had visited all their restaurants. Stayed during the weekend, to celebrate my mom's birthday.  Had an absolutely wonderful stay. There is so much history to the hotel, which is tied to the history of Mumbai. The staff was excellent. Breakfast at the Sea Lounge was fabulous. We took part in the heritage walk within the hotel, and learnt so many interesting facts we didn't know about. The staff very sweetly sent a cake and a bouquet of flowers on my mom's birthday."
This is a truly extraordinary hotel. The staff are wonderful--even helped fix a computer problem. Food is wonderful--and the pool is magnificent and filled with adults who cant swim! Stayed in the heritage win where every room is different
"Been a while since I have been this excited by a hotel, superb service in a heritage hotel, very well located with great art work everywhere you look. Highly recommend and I'm not usually a big hotel fan.  Tower room has more modern rooms but I personally quite like the heritage aspects of the palace wing."
"Well reading the reviews perhaps set too high an expectation. I have traveled extensively and always stay in 5 star hotels so am really looking for something special. This is most definitely a far cry from the best hotel in India. I wonder if these reviews are truly unbiased. I reserved a sea view palace room with club access since the reviews were best for these rooms, but certainly not the cheapest. Room was truly lovely and comfortable in appearance, clean. Perhaps I came at the wrong time as it was insanely hot but the hotel is poorly air conditioned. Having just arrived from the Leela Palace hotel in Delhi where is was also hot, but the rooms were comfortable, it was a completely different experience. We tried but despite the best efforts of the staff we did not get the"
"Hotel is quite extraordinary...art gallery, museum, reflecting on the colonial past... Fabulous pool, quite huge. Fantastic staff, always, unfailingly smiling. They helped us celebrate my travelling daughter's 21st birthday in style. There was even a chap walking round with a red pennant who was deaf aware...you can't get better than that..."
"This is without a doubt, the best hotel in Mumbai. The staff, the service, the facilities, the location, the dining, the shopping and more. All 1st class and very very worthy of it's 5 stars. If you're in Mumbai, then this is The place to stay."
"I stayed at the Taj Palace for 2 night in early June. It is ideally located for meetings in S Mumbai and Lower Parel. The Gateway to India is across the street. I visited the site on an evening around 7 pm (crowded) and again at 8 am the next morning (hardly a few souls). The staff are supremely well trained to be helpful, anticipate needs, go well beyond the call of duty to fulfill your needs and most of all be extremely polite. I enjoyed meals at the Shamiana and the Golden Dragon. Not extensive, but solid menu, great tasting food and attentive waiters at both places. I also used the business center - again, white glove service for my needs. All of this came at a price, but you did not feel terrible paying it when they made you feel so welcome!"
"Great luxury hotel, well worth a stay. We really enjoyed the whole experience. Would have loved to have stayed longer. Mumbai was a great experience, have last visited 12 years prior to this trip, the city has changed so much! its great to see it develop into a wonderful vibrant city, we will defiantly be going back, hopefully stung at the Taj again, only next time for a little longer!!"
thank you to Taj staff for making my wife's and my  10 th wedding anniversary so special.....it was really the perfect place and a dream come true....never expected that my stay would be so memorable specially the suprise cake at 12.....
"After an absence of a year, it was wonderful to return 'home' to the Taj!  From the moment I arrived until the moment I sadly had to leave my stay was simply the very best anyone could hope for.  I was once again fortunate to be staying in The Palace Wing (the heritage part of the hotel) which also permitted me to use the Club Lounge.  The benefits of the club lounge cannot be understated, I think that alongside the artworks throughout the property (do take advantage of their free guided tour), the club lounge is one of my favourite parts of the hotel, offering as it does a sanctuary within a sanctuary, from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai.  Here you can enjoy a welcome drink, and complimentary tea, coffee and soft drinks throughout the day, as well as high tea, cocktail hour"
"Wonderful historic hotel I have visited regularly over many years. The staff are frankly unbeatable. Rather unbelievably though, they have a loyalty program (called Taj Inner Circle) which waits for you to stay several days at the hotel, spend X dollars, and then immediately DOWNgrades you! Hmmm. Loyalty programs create customer engagement and goodwill, right?"
"Last year Me and my parents was gone to trip of Mumbai and at that citi we habe booked Taj Mahal hotel the service of that hotel is pretty good. Food was also very nice we have enjoy lot of their but the best thing Is the rooms of the hotel best bed, with AC and a clean room ..."
As you would expect a delightful welcome to a lovely hotel. Been looking forward to experiencing this for a while and it didn't disappoint. Charming pool set within attractive garden and terrace area which was very good for drinks and food. Restaurant excellent albeit a little expensive. Worth doing the free historical tour around the hotel Recommended
It's always nostalgic when passing by or dropping in the grand hall and reception area. visiting the bookstores and souvenir shops on the ground floor or having coffee with friends. A truly prestigious hotel and well located near the sea and gateway of India .
The service at the Taj is definitely better than any other hotel brand I've experienced. The staff are super friendly and helpful. The lobby is constantly busy no matter what time of the day/night it is but there is always enough staff to handle everyone with a smile. The rooms in the tower are a good size and very standard looking but the service you get makes it worth your while. Turn down service provided every evening and morning paper gets delivered to each room before 6am.   The rooms in the palace are absolutely stunning and every side of the wing has a dedicated butler to attend to the guests' needs immediately. The duty managers make sure your belongings are locked in the safe in case you leave them lying around in the room.   The breakfast at Shamiana and Sea Lounge is
I visited this one of the quality property for my LIC meeting held in March 2016.. conference hall and hotel lobby is good... room are very clean & very nice architechture done.. i would spcly like to tell one thing about hotel staffs & security is very very co operative.. i would to give 9.75 out of 10.00
"A wonderful location at Old(&original Mumbai) opp. Gateway of India.So nicely maintained & decorated that each and every frame of Hotel is eye-catching n a pleasure to see.   Our suit was fairly large compared to Mumbai standard and furnishing & decoration was world-class with giant bathroom.  Breakfast was simply superb ..very big menu with lot of novelty .. off course delicious.So as Lounge. However best part was detailed maintenance and service standards. Everyone was eager to hep & serve with pleasing attitude and it makes difference everywhere Breakfast,Swimming Pool, Lounge..... even house keeping force us to take notice and feel the difference."
"We were greeted at the lobby by our own personal guide dressed in a beautiful sari. When I had problems at 12:30 am with my smartphone, I contacted the reception desk and in 3 minutes a hotel employee was there to fix my phone!"
Such a great place and lovely people it's true what they say every guest is treated like gods.me and my wife stayed for 4 days before we headed of to goa. We had dinner in the Indian restraunt and Thai and both well best food I have tasted. We stayed in the gate way to India room but it was more like penthouse our butlers were spot on as were the whole staff we went out once but when you are there we stayed inside and enjoyed the people.
"Amazing experience.  Hotel is beautiful, located in the heart of Mumbai's historic Colaba neighborhood.  All of our needs were anticipated and met.  Breakfast buffet was amazing, and took place in the beautiful sea lounge where we could look out over the ocean and see the historic Gateway to India."
"Good hotel as it being a TAJ property.Location is good, if you are in a holiday mood.  I stayed in Palace wing sea view but I could not find it worth the money they charged.So you can try the tower wing rooms also with sea view as they come at low price.  Their are various eating joints behind the hotel main one being BADE MIYYA which is walking distance.  They have various restaurants and My experience  with chinese one was good and best part that day was Mr RATAN TATA also was their.  Breakfast  was excellent.  But the lobby is crowded  as general public keeps coming in  for visit to their shopping arcade and hence it was not good place to be on that particular day, 4 th june.  The sad part of this hotel was even I being TAJ inner circle member and the day I checked in was my"
We got picked up from Airport with a smile. Reception was VIP style. All staff were very respectful and helpful. Transport to around mumbai was free from the hotel. From start to end everything was good. No complaints at all. will go again.
"The quality of this hotel is expressed in every moment, the staff care, in every detail, is not found elsewhere. The luxury of the rooms, the bathrooms, are unforgettable. The breakfast is of extremely high standards, as customers are presented with a myriad of choices and can even request personalized dishes, to which the chef will gladly cook. This time I only tried the restaurant by the pool, and the experience was incredible; great service and great quality food. Overall, unforgettable experience; all members of staff even take the time to learn each customer's name to make the experience more unique. Congratulations!"
"Historic, clean, the best location. The staff is very helpful and kind. The hotel is next to India's gate. The rooms are comfortable and very clean. 4 devices can be connected for Internet. Two restaurants with good buffet. "
Went to Taj for some snacks in the evening and enjoyed the time thoroughly with my wife. The snacks were also good and the overall hospitality was also nice.. Had a great time and will cherish it forever
"Loved staying here. A wonderful welcome even with how busy the hotel was. Amazing history learned on the evening tour of the hotel. I still wear the wooden beads given as a welcome gift upon arrival. The grandeur of this hotel is very memorable. Great food, very nice gym with a trainer on stand by to assist you with anything. Staff are all dressed beautifully in traditional attire and are always ready to help. Lovely rooms - although a bit noisy as there was an event going on the night we stayed. Fabulous bathroom. A wonderful experience which I hope to have again soon."
"Seeking charm, service and warmth The Taj Palace Hotel will be hard to beat  which is probably why so many famous have stayed here. The hotel is famous around the world for a reason and it shows in everything they do.  Staff are welcoming and their service skills are top notch. Many other hotels could learn much here.  Room was well appointed with comfortable bed and warm duvet. Very quite with no sound from outside. The floor butlers are helpful with no request too much.   Have breakfast at the Sea Lounge for a very relaxing start to the morning with a great spread to choose from. Want to relax in the afternoon try the Palace Lounge.   For a unique, quality and very memorable stay, you'll remember for life, stay at the Taj."
"We stayed one night at the Taj before flying back and it was the cherry on the cake of our journey through south india. Great view on the gate of India, flawless room and experience. Great location and breakfast. We loved our too short stay from A to Z."
The Taj Mahal Palace is probably India’s most famous hotel. Getting there may take a while from the airport across Mumbai traffic but it is well worth it. It is conveniently located  just opposite the Gateway of India and provides beautiful views of the monument and the waterfront.  To experience the old colonial charm book in the palace wing where the rooms are large and comfortable. Breakfast is phenomenal  and the staff are excellent with all desires duly catered for. Relax alongside the pool or walk around the property to the Starbucks along its one side for your caffeine fix. A must is the guided tour of the property which kicks off from the pool garden.  Tip: get the chauffeur service or taxi to cross over the flyover rather than sit 45 minutes in traffic. Well worth the
"The hotel has over 100 years, I have joined the dairy free tours at 5:00pm about introduce the hotel history. Their Indian food restaurant is the 1st restaurant in India. It is just next to Gate of India, and close with local market. Very good location."
"This is the best hotel in Mumbai, the staff are a true credit to this hotel. You are truly treated like royalty here and nothing is ever too much trouble. The Palace Lounge is a wonderful place to relax with a cup of tea or a drink made to perfection. The spa has a wonderful range of traditional therapies. A true favourite of ours."
Stayed for 2 nights in the Executive Suit 434 in Palace Wing.. Had a perfect stay. Couldn't find a fault. The only area where i see a scope for improvement is the F&B offered in the club loung/Sea lounge. They don't offer much choice of starters in the Lounge whereas taj lands end has a great selection of starters in their club lounge.
"It was beyond words. Totally different experience. We stayed there for seven nights in executive rooms on the sixth floor. Everything was so perfect from hospitality to cleanings, food and service. Would love to go back soon."
"The hotel background and history are impressive. You can travel into Indian culture just by staying at the hotel.  We were located at the palace side The room was spacious and beautifuly decorated highlithing the culture   The service was speechless. Despite of the beautiful venue, the staff really make your experience. They are so attentive and keep surprise you with special attentions.  You can see this level of service in few places in the world.  The restaurants and bar are really really really good too, specially the Indian restaurant and the Harbour bar.  The spa is excellent, we had amazing massages. Book in advance as they are fully booked really fast.  We will definitelly come back to India because of this hotel magical experience.  HBM"
"Had an amazing weekend stay in this property on the occasion of my husband's birthday . The staff were very warm and courteous. Brownie points for getting an upgrade to the palace wing along with a wonderful room decor with balloons and a cake for the occasion. There was a minor delay in the check-in (guess these guys were decorating the room) which was compensated with an apology note and a souvenir. The highlight of the stay was the heritage walk, which took us back to the history of the hotel. The food was amazing and so were the attentive and courteous staff in the restaurant. Going to be a returning guest for them soon!"
"Amazing hotel! The staff was extremely welcoming, knowledgable and went out of their way to make our stay first class.  Sonia checked us in and was very kind.  We saw her several times at the hotel and she always asked us how we were doing and if there was anything she could do.  She really went out of her way to make us feel at home. Shekar also provided us with the history of the hotel as we chatted near the swimming pool, which was very fun and interesting.     Lastly, we met several hearing impaired staff.  They were extremely helpful and friendly.  We were very happy to see hearing impaired employees at the Taj.  It is great!  Thank you again for an amazing time at the Taj Mahal Palace.  I hope to return soon."
"Beautiful view from room over Arabian sea and Gateway to India.   Service is perfect, ambience is great.  5-6 restaurants wisely segregated as per the cuisine they offer were worth enjoyable.This is the epitome of ultimate luxury and professionalism; whatever maybe the occasion, highly recommended."
"I was a massive fan of the BBC2 documentary 'Hotel India' and have wanted to stay in the Taj ever since watching it. It did not disappoint. I stayed here with my partner and our two small children. We arrived in the early hours of the morning after a long flight from Heathrow, we used the Taj's car service to pick us up and the whole experience was well worth the money. They checked us in, in our room, which they also upgraded to the old palace wing, and bought an extra bed to the room, at no extra cost, and also bought hot chocolate for our boys!  The next day we used the concierge, and butler service... a lot! We done a city tour, which was very good, and we also used the pool, which has a lovely view of the hotel. We ate room service for lunch, which was nice, and dined in"
We have been here since June 6th and though i try to convince myself this is the best.. I am not able to. We stayed in Leela palace and had better experience. As someone mentioned...the welcome was not warm.The staff did not give a thorough tour of the room.The food was super good but did not like the service.The air condition is not effective and I was literally sweating inside the restaurant.I hate to write bad reviews but for the money I pay I deserve exceptional service.Also I see the staff hovering around the foreigners and I felt like they treat Indians differently. 
Had my marriage there. Nice experience. Especially the orchestra show was excellent.it has very nice staff. Excellent service. Rooms are also very good.just next to gateway of india.. Nice views from room.The food was very delicious. Must recommend this hotel to the viewers.
"Our 7th Anniversary Celebration. Couldn't have been a better decision to book a room night at the Taj. We were given complimentary upgrade to Palace Wing, Room decorated with Rose Petals and Heart shaped balloon, special reservation at the RoofTop. Loved the experience overall. Only a stay at the Taj would make you believe what ""Hospitality Redefined"" Means :-)"
Probably best hotel experience I have had so far! Service and attention to detail outstanding. Beautiful view from room over Arabian sea and Gateway to India. Staff incredibly friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend this hotel.
Despite countless trips to Mumbai I have never had afternoon here.  I chose the TMP as the reviews were great as was the menu. The array of food was out of this world.  We could barely eat all the food they had on offer and the presentation was amazing.  The service was brilliant and we had a most memorable afternoon taking in the decor and magnificence of this truly remarkable building.
"Reviewing this property is mere a formality as everyone knows that this is a gem of Mumbai. We got the in toto experience of the Taj with its image. Located facing the Gateway of India, Taj is a definition of hospitality and luxury. Smooth and early check-in, traditional welcome style, room upgrades, cleanliness and property upkeepment everything was just perfect. Each and every staff makes sure that you are felt special right from the check-in to check-out. We were given a confirmed booking in Tower wing which was sou motto upgraded to Palace wing. We then asked for a better view room which was happily accepted by front desk manager Mr. Vaibhav and gave a beautiful pool view room in 5th floor. Room was ultra spacious and welcoming. Huge bathroom with a decent sized tub, nice"
"This was our first time at this fantastic hotel I would rocommend it to anyone, the staff were all excellent and looked after us, we were picked up from Mumbai airport by the hotel, check in was carried out in the room, we were provided with a cold drink on our arrival."
This property is truly iconic and the entire staff of the hotel made you feel so very special - nothwitstanding we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. Always wanted to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace - Heritage Wing and we are so mighty pleased that we chose our special day at a really special place. Right from the check-in to check-out each and every individual at the hotel take it upon themselves to make sure you have a wonderful experience of hospitality.
I booked Taj Mahal Palace for my parent's 50th Anniversary. Taj Hotel is a brand that not only represents 5 star luxury hotel but also  beacon of  eliteness and fine service. My parents were made extremely comfortable during their stay and every staff member they encountered knew the purpose of their stay which quadrupled their celebrations.  I did have some issues during the checkout process but their leadership team personally got involved and resolved them post facto. The dining experience was amazing and the staff took time to help them with their order beyond their standard menu.
I booked a room in Tower wing of Taj Colaba for my wife's birthday and was given an upgrade in the heritage wing (one big surprise and good one as well). Later on the decoration and gifts for my 2.5 years old daughter plus a cake for my wife's birthday as complimentary was few amazing things. Thanks for making things special on this occasion.
"the beauty and history of the hotel, the service and the staff, the drinks and the food, everything was perfection. The Japanese restaurant serves the best food I have ever eaten. The cocktails with some original flavors were gorgeous, the Heritage tour is a must. The helpfulness and manners of the staff was perfect. Attention to details was everywhere. Thank you for the free upgrade."
"This hotel offers you a stay in an almost museum like atmosphere, with a opportunity to be a part of the history of Bombay.  The service is beyond compare and the location is ideal.  The rooms are unique, decorated with richness and the bathtub is amazing."
it was a trip with my mother for some casual work in Mumbai.. the hotel was excellent with great experience and perfect interior.  just disappointed as the welcome at check-in was very bad and we even not offered with welcome drink (not even water).. i visited many of the taj hotels across india... but first time i seen un-cleaned bathroom.... normally expectation from TAJ group is very high.. so this silly mistakes should not accepted from this group.   otherwise the best option to stay with family and one of the most luxurious hotel of india.
"It happened to be my mom dad anniversary  owed them this treat coz dey hadn't been to a five star hotel before. The ambience,  service are thumps up. A treat for one who haven't been before. Looking forward soon to be back there."
"Had a wonderful stay at the Taj Palace! The hotel, facilities, and rooms were amazing! The staff were attentive, helpful, and always ready to assist. The pool was lovely for relaxing, the food was delicious, and the location of the hotel is great for looking around the city. Lots of museums and galleries nearby. The only complaint I have is that the lobby and hallways going to your room (which can be a bit of a trek) were extremely hot! I'm not sure if there is not air conditioning in these areas or it just wasn't working properly, but if they can resolve this issue everything would have been better than perfect! The other issue I had was responded to immediately and they went above and beyond resolving and compensating for it which I truly appreciate.Thank you for a wonderful"
Obviously the reputation for this place is known and I was not disappointed. Beautiful architecture and the history of this place is everywhere. I especially loved the pool area as its a beautiful garden area and very relaxing. I think knowing of the chaos outside with all the horns actually makes this very pleasant pool area that much more relaxing. Service is great and the food was all good. I'm so glad I stayed here and would definitely recommend to anyone. 
amazing experience at the carefully maintained palace great view of the sea and gateway of india very beautifully furnished rooms with all the latest gadgets and amenities when u are in mumbai stay at the taj only Wah Taj!!!!
What a truly amazing palace.   Welcomed by a young lady putting a traditional necklace around my neck ... I thought that's how you got married in India !  The restaurant staff and staff overall very service oriented. One waiter made me sample just about everything on the breakfast menu !  I was genuinely made to feel welcome by the staff.  Definitely go back!   
"Stayed at the hotel in May 2016 with the family.  Let me start by saying that I have been to this hotel innumerable times in the past 4 decades as Mumbai is my home town...but this was the first time staying at the hotel, as we were celebrating a special occasion.  We chose the Old Wing, given its heritage status and old world charm.  The check in was straight forward and efficient, and our host even walked us to the room...he must get a lot of exercise.   The room was really perfect...all white marble and pastel colors and lots of Art Deco touches. We had a view of the Harbour, although not the Gateway side. Ask for a higher floor as the view over the rooftops is really spectacular. The bathroom was spacious, with a shower and a bathtub. All the modern amenities were there when"
"I had a wonderful stay here.  The attention to detail was bar none sometimes it was a bit over the top for me.  Located right across from the Gateway to India, the hotel has a magnificent view looking over the bay.  I was given a room in the palace wing and if you can I would recommend booking a room in this wing and booking for a sea view.  I could have sat all day in my room, looking at the view and basking in the tranquility.  Despite it being a heritage building the room was noise proof.   The check in process was quick and efficient.  Checking out was a different matter (there was a rather long queue with not enough people staffed).  The lobby is rather small for a hotel that has so many rooms and can get very congested.    Room service was good and had a nice selection:"
"A trip to Mumbai would not be complete without staying at the Taj Palace!  On our arrival, we received the warmest of welcomes from Amrita, delivered with seemingly effortless professionalism. We actually stayed at the hotel twice during the two weeks we were in India and, on our arrival for the second time, we genuinely felt welcomed back into the fold.  The room was of an exceptional standard on both occasions and cleaned and turned down daily to an exceptional standard. Easy to forget the backroom staff whose contribution is of equal importance to guest facing staff.   The breakfast is amazing and offers vast and varied cuisines from which to choose. The staff are so attentive too.  Anil, Rajesh and Babu deserve a mention as they provided the most attentive service during our"
What a fantastic place this is; class act and above any other hotel in Mumbai. In old section it is taste of times historic past but in good way. Staff fantastic nothing too much trouble; could spend long time here and many different foods available in hotel for most tastes. Outside is an outstanding experience. 
"Amazing experience right from the moment we stepped down from our car. The check-in was smoothest we have seen or experienced.  Special thanks to Chetana for making our daughter feel special,  Parakh for the warm welcome and Nikhil at the pool by being extra cautious when the little one was in the pool. The most exciting part was the surprise upgrade to the Beautiful Palace Wing.   The whole experience of being a tourist in our own city with the view of Gateway and the Arabian Sea was mesmerizing."
"What can I say. A beautiful, opulent hotel. Our visit was for high tea. Friendly, engaging staff tended to us and ensured that we had a fantastic afternoon in the Sea Lounge. We enjoyed an array of canapés, sandwiches, cakes,treats and drinks as we enjoyed the views of the sea and the Gateway to India. Definitely a must to visit. I intend to go again. Very relaxing and inviting.  As we left we were able to tour some areas of this beautiful hotel.  "
"Reception welcome was great and working staff was very kind and good. Breakfast was Excellent,. Security & safety provisions were provided in hotel Excellent. Stair cases & room carets need to be replaced with good ones. Pick & drops rates are very high. No information was provided for city tour"
This is the second time I have visited this hotel and appreciate it more and more.  I took my adult daughters with me this time. The place it self is absolutely amazing. With the gateway opposite makes it the best. We ate lunch by the pool which was tasty Indian food. Breakfast is simply great. We had the Indian breakfast. I still remember Dinesh from our last visit who is really gem to the hotel. He looked after us so well. The  rooms were really luxurious in the heritage wing. All the staff in the hotel are so welcoming and go to any lengths to help you. Housekeeping did lots of extras like flowers designs in our room and gifts for the girls on their last day. We could not fault this hotel. Recommend it for a luxurious break in Mumbai. I believe it is one of the best hotels in
"It is indeed the best hotel to stay.. it was my first time to stay at hotel TAJ.. From my room I have the beautiful view of the Gate way of India and the Arabian sea..I enjoyed  the stay .. Hotel Provided the baby cot for my child, it was awesome. I would say everyone enjoyed..."
"I was gifted a stay in Taj just before my wedding to pamper me with the amazing hospitality and service of Taj and brother chose the finest Taj in India the Taj Mahal Palace.  I stayed in the sea view executive room which has stunning view of the majestic Gateway of India. Seeing Gateway of India from a different angle was superb.  The room was cozy with superb amenities, and everything can be customized as per your requirement from pillows to water. The guest service takes care of your every demand in the best possible way. The sleep quality of bed was superb, I slept like a baby. The washroom had a sink in tub and had all forest essentials toiletries. Mini bar was fully stacked and plus you also get an option of having the in-house wines of Taj.  Living in mumbai, I had dined"
"My family, spouse and a daughter (8 yrs) absolutely loved the place.  From the time we entered, we were treated with utmost care.  Everyone from the lift man, housekeeping staff, caretakers, restaurant managers and trainees, they all were extremely courteous and served with a smile at all times.  Dining at the roof top restaurant was great too.  Their Mediterranean dishes were extremely tasty.  The coffee shop overlooking the Arabian Sea and the Gateway of India had its own charm.  The entire place had an wonderful aura.  Would love to come back once again :-)"
"This was my 3rd trip to Taj Palace Mumbai, my experience with the brilliant service, passionate staff, delicious and varied cuisine and the most exquisite luxury accommodation and lobby, is unparralled , I travel extensively, nothing compares to the Taj Palace offering. My family and I love this hotel and looking forward to our next return."
"We stayed here for one night during an organised trip of India. Having seen this hotel on BBC 2's programme 'Hotel India.' Our one requirement from our trip was that this hotel was included on the tour - we were very disappointed. Our room stank of cigarette smoke, the curtains were dirty, the view was of a back street and the noise from building work continued way beyond its published end time. The service generally was efficient but I felt the staff were aloof and slightly impersonal, apart from the Harbour Bar where we enjoyed a relaxing drink late in the afternoon. We did however have a wonderful dinner at Masala Kraft - the taster menu was delicious and included wine.  It was a shame because we had looked forward to our stay here all holiday - stays at other hotel in the"
"No other place like it - service , location and atmosphere .  A treat for business or leisure.  Staff are extremely helpful , friendly and professional.  Variety of restaurants and shopping close by make for an unforgettable stay."
"Went to Taj hotel with my partner and visited the interior of Taj , which was very nice. There are old photographs on display as well. Clicked a lot of photographs and went for snacks in one of the restaurant.  One must visit Taj hotel if in mumbai"
"We are extremely delighted with the experience, would like to take a bow to the commitment of Taj group in maintaining this great asset of India in a most appropriate way.  Staff was amazing and invariably everyone has extended huge warmth and pleasure in serving us best weekend. The courtesy extended by hotel management in celebrating my wife's B'Day was way beyond our imagination, kids were really amazed to see getting special treatment plus gifts and for me it was moment of truth of seeing everyone happy and jolly.  Dinner at Souk was another highlight where right from Chief Chef to serving staff has ensured all possible efforts in serving most memorable experience.  High-Tea at Sea lounge, courtesy extended by staff, breakfast, gym, pool, heritage tour, property, upkeep"
"The Management and staff were very cooperative and professionally trained with personal touch. On arrival  they performed Guest welcome with aarti,tilak and garland with Tulsi mala. This  was touch our heart."
A amazing colonial palace totally refurbished with a nice view over the Indian Gate.  Very good location in Mumbai!  The main reception and the way the guest are welcome is a very nice surprise!  A lot of security and you feel safe!  Enjoy your Stay in Mumbai!
"The stay was a very pleasant experience. Historical hotel in unbeatable location with world class amenities. Very professional and friendly staff, they went above and beyond the expectation to meet our needs. At breakfast food service manager personally apologized for a delay in serving a custom order. Renovation had modernized the facility while maintaining its colonial grandeur."
"What can I say it was our first stop in India and wow the Taj was amazing, staff sooo friendly,helpful and polite,we had a suite over looking the gateway of India,what an amazing room very clean, the bed was great sleep very well after a long trip from London. We had dinner at the hotel the one that serves Indian very nice. When we got back to our room we had been left an happy honeymoon cake and the room was filled with bloons and some flowers such a lovely touch from the hotel. Thank you taj for such a lovely welcome to India."
Superb hospitality. When they came to know about anniversary they upgraded the room to the heritage wing. We were mesmerized to see the beauty of heritage wing. It felt like living in British Era of India. Beautifully designed and decorated rooms. Art pieces and frames in corridors were rare and seen never before. Life time memory. 
"Loved the stay at Taj Mahal Palace Hotel... I felt pampered from the time we entered the hotel till we left the place... The art of customer service can surely be learnt by staying this place... Service with a smile seems to be their motto... Overall, a brilliant stay at a wonderful hotel!!"
"right from the time of arrival to our departure from the Taj Palace, Mumbai, we were treated as part of one big family. it recreated the essence of a ""home away from home"" . The best part was that in this home we did not have to worry about anything... all our needs were fulfilled either in a nick of time or in some cases even before we anticipated it. For eg turning down the bed and preparing the room for the night. It was such small details that brought smiles to our faces. They were very particular about kids as well. So my eight year old son was also treated like a prince with extra care and attention from everyone at the hotel.  Thanks for making our holiday a truly memorable one.... Looking forward to many more such experiences..."
"Enjoyed a lot good service and food was very good ,rooms of the hotel was good and staff of the hotel is well managed .the food we ordered was good and very tasty .we enjoyed a lot .had a lovely time spent in taj hotel with my friends"
"We booked into the Taj Mahal Palace expecting it to be excellent, however we booked into the cheapest rooms hoping they would be just as good. As it turned out we were upgraded & we were made to feel very welcome & there is absolutely nothing we can fault about this hotel, & really the prices are so cheap compared to Sydney. Our four days is going too quick & we cannot wait to come back. "
If you were in mumbai and want to stay in mumbai with not so much expensive hotel than taj mahal palace is good affordable for you. I stayed there  2 days and liked its service. Good management nicely behaviour staff good quality food. All these I liked very much.
Staying at the Heritage wing of the Taj Mahal Palace has become a yearly ritual for us now. We have to stay at least once in a year there and enjoy the hospitality. The grandeur is amazing and the service makes you want to go again and again.
"We stayed for hubbys 60th birthday, one word, ( WOW) we booked a club room in the Palace wing, We felt like Royalty, us humble working class were treated to one day and one night of Absolutly every luxury you could emagine. The staff, I have never in my life encountered such wonderfull people, I don't really know what to say, BUT, if you only do one thing in your life stay at this Hotel, it is worth every penny, and more, the food, the wines, the rooms the bed,  I wonder did I dream it, but no, I have photos to look at, It is A Magnificent place, You have to stay here,"
"Extremely happy with the oveall experience with the Taj. They made the anniversary day quite special with their subtle overtones thereby lending a personalised touch. I understand they also have an suite upgrade option for an extra 5k (for Taj innercircle)which surprisingly was not informed to us. There were some minor irritants such as the room size and cooling in the room which we lived with. Regardless, the palace ambience and overall decor makes it well your worth."
"From the moment you enter the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai you enter something special. The attention to detail makes this one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. From the cleaners to the management, the bell boy to the handyman you will be treated like the most important person in the world. The small things are what matter and these are the things that most places fail to deliver. If you could bottle outstanding service and attention to detail, then this is what it would be made off.   Visited Mumbai to celebrate a special birthday, couldn't have started much better with a room upgrade to the Palace Wing (the old part) what a stunning place. Spotlessly clean, unbelievable attention to customer service and an all round leader in hotel operation.   The room, simply"
We stayed here for one night on my birthday. The staff made my day truly special! We had booked for a room in the tower wing but they upgraded us to the palace wing room with a partial sea view. Later in the   evening they decorated my room with balloons and sent a red rose bouquet and a cake for me!! The cake was yummy! I totally enjoyed my stay! Great hospitality!! Will definitely come back!
"The best hotel to stay at when in Mumbai period. Nothing else comes close when you thing of the history, architecture, location, amenities etc.  The complementary breakfast is also quite delightful! The pool area in the back gives a resort feel even though you are in the heart of the city!"
"It was a dream to stay at the Taj hotel, which came true when my hubby surprised me on our 15th anniversary :) Hotel staff surprised us with a cake.... decorated our room with balloons & candles ....wowww am over the moon...a Big Thank u for the whole team who had decorated our room so nicely. Truly the hotel is a majestic & v got a very good view of the gateway of india......overall a beautiful stay at one of the best hotels in the world."
"gorgeous hotel with a perfect location in Mumbai. the historical palace is just the perfect place for a romantic stay. the service is perfect - kindness, efficency. I would recommand to choose a room with a sea view and in the palace for those who like the historical atmosphere but with all required services of a top range 5stars palace hotel"
Just loved the Tajj Mahal Palace.. Simply beautiful . Celebrated my wifes birthday.. They took care of everything.. Just loved how  the staff took care of all the small details.. A Big Big Thank you to all the wonderful people at the Taj Mahal Palace..
No one knows how to pamper hotel guests better than the Taj. The entire staff was most courteous and kept on ensuring that our stay was an ever evolving pleasure stay. Must must stay. If you are facing any issues please let the staff know and they would make it go away with the snap of a finger.
"This was something like dream come true for me, as i had planned to stay in Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai since long but some or other reason it was not working, this time i was finally able to stay at (my dream hotel), no words could describe this place and if i do that it would be insult to such iconic place, in simple words you need to feel it. My stay was simply superb and would strongly recommend all of you to at least stay one night at this place. And if you are staying in this place then please make sure that you don't miss Taj Mahal Hotel Tour as they share many good stories related to this place and it is worth attending."
"An excellent hotel and high class services. The hotel security is tight all around and makes a visitor feel safe everywhere. All the staff are well trained, polite, smiling and courteous.  We noticed the bath robes in the room had a belt loop missing and not replaced. At the breakfast restaurant the napkins were thick with starch that stuck to our clothes. We were not given proper instructions to use the elevators on arrival."
"We had a very memorable experience on our 16th wedding anniversary at Taj Mahal  palace hotel- dutch suite.We appreciate Mr Lalit, our butler who was always there for us. Our guests who we invited also had a nice lunch at the Masalakraft"
Stayed here for one night on my anniversary.  It was a good stay and a very nice hotel.  The experience was just amazing.  Lovely place situated just next to Gateway of India.  Completely different feel.  Room was large with a spacious bathroom.
"Taj Mahal - Mumbai is an awesome property and excellent team managed under very able General Manager and it maintains the quality and ambience and service to best in market place. The awesome food at Golden Dragon as well as Shamiana, Wasabi and Sea Lounge is to look for always. The ambience over all in hotel is great."
"Stayed here for a night with family of four (2A+2K). Service, decor and experience here is of a different level altogether.  We stayed at the palace luxury room (242) which is on southern side of the heritage building. Fortunately one of the very few rooms with a balcony. Decent view - bit of sea and lot of activity. Room was large with a very spacious bathroom. Classic decor, nice and comfortable bed. Bathroom in white marble lends elegance. Large bathtub and separate shower cubicle. Nice and powerful shower jets.  Foyer of the palace section is beautiful and grand staircase offers lot of points to collect memories.  Swimming is big and water very clear. Green tiles at the bottom give the pool a little murkier look. Plenty of space around the pool and small lawns give up a feel"
"The problem of staying here once is that you may not want to stay anywhere else. The location and atmosphere is out of the world and needs no mention. Do go for the Sea Facing room though. A few thousands extra, but well worth it. All the complimentary breakfast options choose ""Shamiana"". It doesn't have a view of the sea but a fabulous spread of Indian and Continental food. P. S: While in the area do check-out ""Colaba Social "" for drinks and bites. "
Lovely hotel situated next to the Indian gate. The hotel is 113 years old and has a lot of charm and history. Warm welcome from the guest relation lady at the old wing. Nice spacious rooms with good bathroom and amenities. good pool side garden and terrace The humidity and high temperature in the corridor was a little too much especially when coming out of your room although lower floors seems ok).  Breakfast in the all day restaurant has a large selection of dishes however we found the quality of the food to be average. Waiters were not always attentive and sharp to our simple request. Nice bar for an evening drink and good Indian restaurant.
"If you are in Mumbai searching for a palace like hotel, this one is for you. An amazing one with large rooms, great sight views and an excellent stay. A family tour at Mumbai can just be made awesome by having this hotel in your visit list."
"Stayed here as final hotel on our Jules Verne tour. When we arrived, hot, tired  and sweaty after an early morning flight and a morning's sightseeing, we were eager to get to our rooms: but we were sidelined as a rather haughtily elegant blonde lady swept out of a white Mercedes and into the lobby ahead of us (in our minibus). The seating in the lobby was taken and when our small party of five went to take a seat in the coffee lounge area we were asked to leave!!!!! As the others waited patiently I made a futile protest by plonking myself on the carpet. (Nobody noticed except my husband, who found me embarrassing.)  Eventually some guests got up and we were able to sit in the lobby, while our tour guide attempted to register our party (something which took about 20 minutes!). An"
Our visit to the Taj Palace was an out of body experience. The staff were so welcoming and attention to detail was top of the world. I have never been to a city hotel where you are made so welcome that you feel like a royalty. Would be my number one place to stay in Mumbai everytime I visit.
Beautiful Opulent Hotel with wonderful wonderful service One of finest hotels have ever stayed in across the world Amazing beautiful outdoor pool that has to be enjoyed Make sure you take time to visit this lovelt hotel
" I stayed at the The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel because it was in my TO DO List since forever.  We stayed at the Palace View with a Gateway of India View.   Its amazing. The royal antique feel is too good.  Service is amazing. Service of Taj is good everywhere. But its even better here.  But if travelling with Kids.... they will enjoy more at the more Modern Hotels, which are more widely spread and have more contemporary feel.  The pool is very deep after just a few meters.. gives hardly any place to enjoy with kids and / or family.  I came here.... because I had too .. its iconic... its amazing...  But I wont be coming back again... though I will keep telling people that I have stayed at the Palace Wing Gateway-View Room of the most iconic hotel of the country.  - rishi gulati"
We only stayed here for one night as part of a package tour. It happened to be my birthday so to find our room full of balloons and a birthday cake just made our stay in an excellent hotel that bit more special.
"No 200 characters can define the beauty and luxury of this majestic place. You've got to sit in its lap and soak in the atmosphere. Be it Wasabi or Souk or the evening-lit swimming pool, you can't stop raving about the detailing. In a nutshell: Heritage meets new world charm."
"Average rooms, Cleanliness needs substantial improvement. lack of electrical sockets to accommodate multiple pin types. Barring the wonderful location, heritage property,  otherwise, better hotels for lower price in Powai etc for a short business trip."
"Simply the only place to stay in Mumbai.  It is my favourite hotel on the planet. Staff are amazing, food is delicious, rooms are perfect.  It's in the perfect setting and having breakfast overlooking the Gateway is a perfect start to the day.  The pool area is superb and an oasis of calm in a bustling city just on your doorstep.  Can't beat it!!!"
"This truly was the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Informed, courteous and diligent staff, phenomenal food (the Golden Dragon chinese restaurant especially), beautiful suites and rooms, an exceptional tour, fantastic food, pool, tour of the city by our driver...there really was nothing to critique. Everything was to the highest standard. Staying in the Ravi Shankar suite during off-season was a brilliant treat. Thank you to all the staff for one absolutely unforgettable stay - it is an experience I will always remember in the highest regard!"
"One of the extraordinary hotels as expected. We friends went for a holiday trip and it was awesome too. Rooms are well decorated , neat and clean . Large bedrooms with balcony that is very advantageous. Food supply quality and room delivery on time ; food quality also very good .Receptionists are very helpful and the managements responses with any quary or something else. In a word whatever you want or wish to get you will get it; it was a great experience."
"It was a royal experience. In the Palace wing, it gives you a feeling that you live in a King's abode. it was a great experience. I will be one of the most unforgettable moments in my life. How ever, fruits and some good chocolates could have been served as compliments since the stay was in the Palace wing. And as I was Taj Inner Circle Gold member the manager could have met me to check how the service was."
"Lovely hotel, whisks you back in time if you stay in the old house. Well located, right outside of the Gate to India and back to its former self since the dark days of 2008. My only point of dissatisfaction was the quality of the various restaurants cuisine; I found all of them to be over priced for the quality of the food served, and the cooked breakfast to be sub standard. However, service is impeccable throughout and if it wasn't for the food choice, the Taj would get a 10/10. as it stands, I'll give it a 8.5."
"We stayed here as a couple for one night - and it was a wonderful experience ! Half expected the staff to be snobbish ( considering that it is one of the most exclusive hotels in Mumbai ) - but every member of the staff we interacted with were nothing but courteous and very friendly at all times. The property itself is simply gorgeous and has a class of its own which is unparalleled. We got a great room on the 2nd floor - which had an awesome view of the Gateway as well as a sea view ( Palace Wing ) . The service was great in general , swimming pool was nice - only let down was probably the breakfast spread and service at the Sea Lounge - quite a limited spread and the staff was quite slow here. All in all - highly recommend the property for a relaxing getaway/special occasion !"
"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights at the Taj Palace on 8th & 9th May 2016. From the moment we walked through the doors after security screening, we were wowed by the oppulence and magnificence of this hotel  Every member of staff we interacted with was professional, courteous, friendly and efficient - we cannot find any fault whatsoever.  Our room was in the Tower block, and looked out onto the Gateway to India. Immaculately furnished with a massive double bed and every facility the business or holiday traveller could ask for - including free WiFi (unlike some other posts have suggested)  Fresh rose petals were scattered in the batcroom, there were quality toiletries, and plenty of bottled water by both sides of the bed.  As we were on a business reward trip our only meala at"
"What sets this hotel apart from many others is the exemplary service it offers. The staff are extremely polite and courteous and will go out of their way to make your stay comfortable.   On one of the days, we reached our room and realised it was still being cleaned- we decided to wait outside the room on the comfortable sofas. The duty manager happened to cross by and immediately offered us magazines to make sure we weren't uncomfortable in any way. A late night pregnancy craving for peanuts was again immediately indulged in by the staff.   The buffet breakfast at the hotel is very lavish. Despite the self-service, the staff are attentive to every need of your's and are more than happy to bring a particular item of choice for you.   The hotel has many high quality restaurants-"
"Stayed here as part of my honeymoon - wow, what a hotel. Service was excellent, room was fantastically appointed, comfortable, and luxurious. Everyone went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and special. Breakfast overlooking the Gate was gorgeous. What a treat!"
"It's impossible to give a judgement different from impeccable. Taj Mumbai is reasonably priced, but it's worth every penny; we've been on holidays in November only for one night and everything was splendid. The rooms and service are amazingly clean. Thumbs up!"
"Well what can I say!!! What an absolute pleasure to stay in. The hotel was absolutely amazing, staff was amazing, food was amazing, the whole experience was amazing. If going to India again I would definatly stay here again. It was for my husbands 50th birthday and I will never forget it."
"Had a beautiful experience at the Taj hotel. Stunning interiors, impeccable service and a perfect nights stay. Not to mention that the breakfast is also to die for. Everything was perfect and I wouldn't be able to think of anything negative to say even if I tried. Loved every moment and can't wait to stay again! "
"It was a once in a live time stay for us. We enjoued every single hour of our stay in the palace and also outside the palace. The staff and the security were very expertness, helpfull and respectfull to us. The breakfast have plenty healthy choises."
This was long cherished desire fulfilled as we enter this grand hotel located in Colaba area of Mumbai just opposite Gateway of India. The superb Architecture and lovely welcoming people and caring staff was amazing.
"Outstanding service, perfect location in Colaba, a strategic place to visit Mumbai iconic locations, nice bars and cafés in the surrounding, shopping and even to visit Elefanta caves, a world Heritage site on an island!   Highly recommend."
"Beautiful premises, excellent service, ideal location. All areas of the hotel spotlessly clean. Attention to detail amazing for example left sunglasses out in the room and came back to glasses cleaning equipment place alongside. Staff really friendly with just the right level of professionalism.  Would highly recommend the heritage tour. Cannot praise this hotel enough"
We as family had stayed in the Taj Mahal Palace.   The Staff is polite and help full. Always took care of us. The rooms and other areas of the hotel is very clean.    I love food. I'm a big food person. I'm really passionate about eating good food all the time. And I got this at Taj (Golden Dragon)
I went Mumbai for a short term business trip and that too in The Taj.  Taj is an amazing hotel at a great location. The ambiance of the hotel is wonderful.  Had an afternoon tea at Taj and was it was awesome.
This is an iconic property of the Taj Group of Hotels. Overlooking the Gateway of India it has a unique location. The rooms in the new wing are modern and better take a room with the ocean view on a higher floor. The heritage wing is more expensive but luxurious. In the evening stop by the sea lounge for high tea. Try getting a table by the window for a lovely view. Wasabi is one of the best restaurants in the city so must try and have a meal there. The Taj truly lives up to its reputation of unmatched service.
"I had been taj for my anniversary and believe me it was just awesome experience! They welcomed me with a holy necklace and a bouquet of almost 50 red roses! Then they upgraded my room from the tower wing to the palace wing and also give me the top floor and sea view. My room was decorated with petals and candles, cake and wine bottle. The food was OK but the way it was presented was amazing. Pool was very small so hardly any body was using it. But in all it was a great experience."
"The Taj Hotel in Mumbai is the best hotel to stay in.  The ambience in the lobby is fabulous with the freshly decorated flowers and ample sofas for guests and/or visitors to hang-out.    The room service is excellent.  Your room is cleaned twice a day and the staff members are ever so friendly.  Breakfast in the dining room overlooking the Arabian Sea is totally awesome!  And of course, the breakfast spread really gives you the value for your money.    In summation:  This is the TAJ, what is there not to like!"
"We stayed at the Taj Palace, Mumbai in the old wing, what a fabulous property, the staff makes you feel like royalty, their politeness & helpfulness are incomparable. We tried the food at Wasabi, Aquarius & Shamiana, must say it still tingles the palate"
"What an awesome visit to this world famous hotel. it has been totally reinstated following the attack 8 years ago, not a sign of damage. The architecture is amazing the opulence or sense of it from a previous era was everywhere. Afternoon tea was not the main event it was the building, I couldn't get enough of it, every room different, every floor amazing, So special"
Amazing hotel. All luxury. Plenty of history. Great location. Multiple restaurants & boutiques inside. Next door to the Gateway of India. Many shops nearby. Plenty of things to do. Would like to have had more time.
"After using Tripadvisor for numerous years I have never posted a review, however after my stay at the Taj Mumbai I'm inspired to post my first review. I have stayed at numerous luxury hotels around the world but have never experienced a level of service and luxury as here. It was an absolute pleasure to spend 2 nights. The dedication of the staff is unsurpassed, we were looked after my numerous staff that have exceeded 30 years of service at the Taj an amazing feat itself. I will be travelling to India on a regular basis and will ensure this hotel will be my preference everytime I am in Mumbai. Bravo Taj Mahal Palce."
"Wonderful ambience, especially in the old wing. The rooms are large with spacious bathrooms. You also get to have breakfast at the Sea Lounge and use the Palace Lounge for tea and cocktails - both of which are fabulous.   This is certainly 5 stars but have given it 4 given it is not that business friendly - eg takes a Long while to reach the lobby, gym is very far away, a lot of traffic near the hotel which adds time in transit. I would also suggest they improve the quality of their toiletries "
"I arrived at the Hotel and was immediately impressed by my reception. Cases whipped away and Front Desk was eagerly awaiting me. Upbeat welcome, with efficient processing was just the start.I had been told to expect a visit from Jayanti Ghosh and sure enough she introduced herself to me and gave me a bouquet of flowers and some herbal bath additives. I was also offered an upgrade from my very nice Tower Suite to a suite in The Palace Wing. This I accepted and there I was in the heart of an historic building that had hosted Kings and Queens and Heads of State swell as the A list of Hollywood and Bollywood. I would be greeted by staff members by name walking down the corridors or as I approached the Dining rooms. The concierge organised tours with an english speaking driver and"
Organised & faultless service. Nothing was too much trouble from the bottom to the top of the organisation. We highly recommend this hotel. Nothing is too much trouble and all you have to do is enjoy your day
"Taj Hotel    Its the Taj Palace, one of the most luxurious hotels in India so obviously expectations where high and boy did they live up to it.  Luxurious and spacious rooms, immaculate bathrooms, premium toiletries and excellant views.  Remember to try to book for ""palace wing"" so you actually stay in the palace,  Tower wing is in the neighbouring building. Which i'm sure is luxurious, but still doesnt have the feel of Taj Palace :)  The palace lounge was a great place to unwind and have their complimentary tea (over 40 varieties!) overlooking the Gateway of India in a luxurious lounge.  Breakfast was a feast on its own.  Every possible egg variety could be cooked for you, tons of western and indian foods, fresh fruits, popular detox juices (think vegetable juices) and for the"
Very old hotel but trendy and modern and developer inside is very suitable for business and leisure together and to spend beautiful moments and has sea views on the famous Gateway of India that is also very big and luxurious rooms area of the hotel and the disadvantage of the large number of birds around the pool a little bit and wait before going for breakfast
"Was affected in 26/11 attacks, but the hotel has fought back well. Parking is an issue but otherwise luxury is real good.  View from the rooms is of the gateway of India and sea.  Has some of the well known restaurants in the hotel. Must say the hotel looks amazing from outside. Has some of showrooms of the most well known brands! "
"Attention to quality services to details. Coming from a hospitable country, I could not help but being surprised of the hotel's beauties, comfort, amenities and not forget to mention about their efforts."
"Really very good hotel, great room (not the basic level) and service. Such a wonderful atmosphere in the hotel too. Even at 3am I was greeted warmly and efficiently then shown to my room. Breakfast overlooking the Gateway to India is a real treat as well. "
"I spend over 150 nights a year in hotels, and the Taj Palace in Mumbai outclasses every other hotel I've stayed in.  The rooms are lovely, the food is great, the swimming pool is blissful after a long day of meetings, but its the staff that make the Taj Palace spectacular.  Every single member of staff is friendly, polite and happy to help without ever being intrusive. The staff in the Sea Lounge deserve special mention as they make me feel so welcome and at home here - an important factor when you are away from your own home so much.  They all remember my name, where I like to sit and how I like my coffee.  I can't thank them or praise them enough for the service they provide."
"I visited the Taj on a Saturday night with my brother. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful - the pool, lobby, restaurant - all stunning. The staff are welcoming and very helpful. We were lucky enough to have a room that overlooked the Gateway to India - whilst these rooms are probably noisier due to the road, the view is worth it. The room was spacious and tastefully decorated but the bathroom, whilst very clean and well maintained, is in need of some modernisation compared to the rest of the hotel. The breakfast was a real treat with everything and anything you could ever want. One slight groan is that there are currently some building works going on (perhaps to the 80s bathrooms!) which the hotel did apologise for but were noisy none the less. Overall a worthwhile splash"
It was a kind of royal experience at the Taj Mahal Palace. The hotel is so well taken care of and it is maintained like a heritage sight. There is a tour of the entire site every day at 5 pm where the visitors are appraised of all the minute details of the hotel and its history. The visit to the suites gave a feel of royalty. I was touched by their gesture of sending across a special cake for my 5 year old daughter when I ordered for dinner in our room. The staff takes the extra effort to provide customer delight and are extremely helpful.  Never before had such a truly world class experience.
"We have never been so well looked after. The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbia. It is the only place we want to stay at. The standards are exceptional and the staff are so friendly and helpful,the history tour was great. Wonderful Resturants to eat in Pool,Gym, Salon ,Spa and the view from our room of The Gateway To India is amazing.The Art work and  Antique Furniture is fantastic All around the hotel is beautiful .Dont know if any other will meet their standards ."
"My fiancé and I spent four nights at the Taj.  Service is the best I have ever experienced in all of my travels -- the staff ensures that your every need/want is exceeded.  Every staff member is highly trained, greeting guests as they walk by. Housekeeping is thorough and even placed rose petals at the entrance to the room on the last night.  I highly recommend booking at the Palace wing due to the beautiful architecture and decor. After each meal we ate, at least one chef visited our table and asked for our feedback on their food directly.  Food is expensive, so budget accordingly, but it was some of the best quality I've ever had (especially at a hotel).  Definitely plan on the amazing high tea buffet and at least one meal at Wasabi (Japanese restaurant).  The spa offers great"
"There's simply no better way to experience luxury in Mumbai. While for me, it's a staycation, if you're prepared to splurge, this is the place to do it. Whether you want to lounge by the pool with a drink at hand or eat ice cream in bed while watching your favourite show, I can't think of a better drilled and courteously staffed hotel to do it in. Love the food and the ambience in every restaurant or lounge. Stay in the Heritage wing for sure though, do yourself that one favour. It's an incredible experience. Always."
"One years about the hotel for different reasons.  It's historical and holds many stories about people you have read and heard about.  It also suffered a terroristic nightmare in 2008 but has recovered and serves it's guests with such high service standards that you may think you are royalty.  There are two buildings in which to book:  the original palace and the towers.  They are both great but the palace is the one to book if you don't mind paying higher rates.  I can't say enough good things about this wonderful hotel.  Views are great and overlook the Arabian Sea and the India gate and the location is excellent for walking on the promenade and for shopping.  If you only have one visit to Mumbai, say here!"
"It has been said that in India the guest is king, and nowhere is this more evident than at the hotel which has been consistently ranked among the world’s most luxurious for over a century. The hospitality one would expect to be extended to royalty, heads of state and celebrities, and has been for more than a hundred years, is extended to every guest with such dignity, humility and efficiency that it has to be experienced to be believed. Furthermore, the royal treatment begins before you even leave home.  Our visit was quite a special occasion for my wife and I, so there was considerable correspondence before we arrived. Every inquiry was answered in a timely, professional and considerate manner by all staff. Taj Guest Relations Executive Natasha Jassawalla wrote that “We are"
"The best hotel in the world with some of the most genuine long serving staff ever. Huge fun and a Mumbai must-stay. Book it now, go for the Club Palace rooms and relish the beauty. I have been staying here for over 15 years a couple of times a year and it never fails to impress. No wonder I dream of the Taj when I am back in London. A wonder of the hotel world!"
"One more stay at a Taj property and yet another excellent experience. We had a completely wonderful stay here in the Heritage wing, club room.   Service was par excellence, from every single staff we encountered across the board, everywhere. It was so pleasant to just be there. Palace Services was excellent as was the fantastic Palace Lounge.   The swimming pool is amazing, huge in size with nice warm water.  Food at the restaurants and in room dining were both excellent.   Special mention to Neston at Wasabi who really made our dinner extremely special - he went way beyond anything that he had to do. Super service, outstanding and a big thank you to him.   And Pradeep at breakfast at Sea Lounge - made our mornings very lively and entertaining. Service par excellence.   Do not"
Superb ambience and building. Location great. But the best of all is the service. Treated like a family member. Looked after. Kind staff. Treat everyone equally. And with patience and respect. The guest comes first. Can't wait to go back there!! It was worth every cent. 
One should definitely visit to experience the richness of hospitality and the heritage. The Sea lounge restaurant overlooking the sea is extremely satisfying view and one can spend hours there even if nobody is by their side
The Taj has a history of excellence and I have stayed in several in India and expect a higher level of standard.  This weekend was very disappointing except for the location.  It was all very ordinary and not worth the cost.  I was disappointed from the moment I was received at the front desk right through the check out procedure.
"Was celebrating my 10th anniversary last Dec 2015 and what a memory it has left us with !! Booked a Superior room in the Tower wing facing the sea side (  yes its costs a couple of thousand bucks more to get that view ) right on the 18th Floor of the 22 storied building !! The Taj hospitality started at the reception and then we greeted with a special bouquet in the room, sent by the staff for our occasion!! It didn't stop there...a lovely Chocolate pastry was sent soon after and we were feeling oh so nice!! It continued when we went to the rooftop restaurant Souk in the evening where the manager had reserved our seats right next to the sea view, a request which I had made almost a week prior to checking in !! Wow !! The captain delighted us with his stories about Taj and his 30"
"Came back to Taj after one year and loved when they offered free upgrade to heritage room. Hospitality at Taj is class apart, Room given was big and spacious, with nice sea view. We also availed In room dining and service was prompt and food was delicious."
The hotel has grand conference facilities with attractive decor and paintings. The hotel has colonial architecture with various memorabilia placed at strategic locations. The passageways also has photographs of its well known patrons of yore which also provides a window to the past. Snacks and the business lunch was delectable.
"Even though its a heritage hotel, it offers great experience in terms of service, quality of foods, comforts, and value for money. Its a luxurious experience in a heritage hotel.   Its location is historic, its structure is imposing, and its interiors are contemporary."
"Stayed for three nights at the end of April, amazing hotel, amazing staff throughout the whole hotel, wished we could of stayed for longer. We had both our breakfast and dinner in the Shamiana which was lovely such a great selection to chose from, we could of had breakfast at the Sea Lounge but I don't think it offers as much variety but the views are amazing. Stunning hotel. Will definitely go back."
Stayed in the Palace wing. Staff at the palace check in desk wonderful. Always obliging when it comes to letting you see a few different rooms. I think this was my 9th or 10th stay so that says it all really. This hotel is magnificent...a pool area you won't want to leave & service in all  departments is impeccable. When I say I'm visiting Mumbai I really mean I'm visiting The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel!
Traveled to Mumbai solo this trip and stayed here. The hotel accommodations were great. The service was spot on. The room decor was just ok and maybe a little out-dated. Could be because I was in a cheaper room but cheaper was still expensive.  I did have a beautiful view of the Gateway of India and it looks amazing when the sun was coming up.  The food in the main cafe was great. I didn't eat in any of the other restaurants mainly because I wanted something very casual as I was alone.   I would stay again. 
"I've stayed at Taj Mahal hotel on number of occasions but its almost always been in the heritage wing, until recently when I stayed in the 'new wing' for the first time.  'New Wing' is priced more competitively than the heritage wing and I was a little sceptical about service in these rooms, but I was pleasantly surprised.  My room overlooked the Gateway of India - which is indeed a breathtaking view. Was large with world-class amenities etc. Having said that, wardrobe space in my rooms was inadequate but apart from that everything was upto five star standards.  Concierge services at this property are fantastic  I also very much enjoyed sitting by the pool, which is a exclusive area for hotel residents and enjoying a nightcap before heading to my room  Breakfast room is crazy"
"its very pride moment to enter to this hotel, such a big name , taj mahal palace is BEAUTIFULLY Designed & HAVE A GLORIOUS LOOK. ROOM ARE SMALL BUT VERY GOOD , STAFF IS WELL BEHAVED AND EDUCATED, rooms facing west havea great look of sea and Gatew way of India toward east facing windows"
"My wife and I stayed at the taj during a holiday to india.   Everything about this hotel is spectacular from the moment you pull.up.at the entrance.  The security great you and assist you in with your bags. Check in is swift and professional. As our room was being cleaned my wife and I were seated in a lounge and brought drinks.  The room is beautifully decorated with comfortable beds and you feel.at home.  The dining.experince is.also fantastic and the waiters are full of knowledge explaining every dish.  When staying at the taj the staff make every guest feel like they are the most important guest in the hotel.  Amazing, cannot wait to visit again"
"What to say, just fabulous...every corner of the Taj Mahal is fabulous....Rooms, Corridors,Restaurants, Breakfast by the pool....Just gives you goose bumps seeing pics of all the celebrities who have stayed here in the past....A Natural Treasure!"
"We returned to Taj and what a Nostalgic feeling we had. Out standing services and food. People are warm, caring and professional. The ball room sit down dinner was a master piece. My wife enjoyed her swimming as the pool is so well designed. I loved my Gym, though it does not have a great view. Our breakfast in Shamiana was well spread out"
Went last weekend with my wife for a two days stay to the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. We stayed in the Palace Wing ( the place to stay due to his historic atmosphere) and a Taj Club Room (booked) and through our AMEX package got upgraded to an Executive  Corner Suite with a partial sea view. I have rarely seen such a well appointed and maintained with all modern amenities in a hotel of such an age (102 years).  What stands apart in this hotel is the service and friendliness of the personnel which is very heartwarming considering the normal atmosphere in Mumbai. Besides the room the whole wing (Hotel) was so incredibly maintained and in an impeccable condition which impressed us tremendously. The other part to mention is the Japanese Wasabi by Morimoto restaurant. Just one word

You made our stay memorable.  Outstanding customer service. attention to every detail. Professional and friendly staff. Would stay again and again. Can't wait to come back for the pampering! Highly reccommend this hotel.
Came here for a drink after visiting the gateway to India. Beautiful hotel and as non guests we were able to go to the seaview restaurant only. Nice mocktails and not too expensive. Interesting to see the wealth comparison with the poverty outside.
"In a city like Mumbai, noisy , dirty, overpopulated, hot and a litle big crazy, the Taj Majal Hotel is a relaxing buble and a great way to begin my travel trough India. The corridors and decoration are inspiring. The staff is friendly and simpatetic. We had a very good experience,  Thanks for the nice stay!"
"History oozes from the old hotel and its position near the gateway to India. Like nearly everywhere in this teeming metropolis, the surrounding area is dusty and chaotic but inside is an oasis of calm. The view from the adjoining modern tower which houses a formal restuarant is spectaculr (although are all those eagles/etc hovering over the cemetery?). Rooms are spacious and comfortable. My only negative is that the wait staff shake the champagne bottles before serving. I was told this was to create a better pop, more dramatic and romantic apparently. But a small thing and a great hotel"
"The Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai is truly a gem. The hotel is absolutely stunning, but more so the service is phenomenal. This will certainly be my hotel of choice whenever I am in Mumbai. Thanks to everyone for making sure I had an incredible experience."
"We had lunch at the Souk restaurant last weekend and I regret to say I was seriously disappointed with the food. The food is not even close to being authentically Lebanese. We had the lunch buffet of which the options were minuscule. The hummus and falafel were completely tasteless and the salad wasn't completely fresh. I have eaten at Lebanese restaurants around the world and I would say that this is the worst one by far. The service was also appalling as the staff are nonchalant. I asked the waiter 3 times for a straw before this was delivered to our table. Although the khobez was being made fresh, this is was not authentically Middle Eastern but tasted more like Indian roti! I think the chef must have thought that by adding Zaatar to the bread it would make it authentic when"
"We were on a tour of Mumbai and had lunch here.  It was truly fabulous... And certainly lived up to expectations.   We had lunch in the main restaurant  of the new (Tower) wing.   It was a buffet... But not what you'd expect of a buffet.... This was fabulous!   Both Western and Indian food,  impeccable service and the opulence you'd expect at such an iconic hotel.   Entering the hotel you must go through full security check which is understandable.   The reception area is stunning...  It's one reception for both the original and new Tower parts of the hotel.   There are traditional ""Tulsi""  necklaces at reception which bring good health and fortune...  These are given on arrival.   If you like ""people watching"" then take some time out in the lobby... You'll see fabulousness for"
"I stayed in the Taj Palace Hotel for business.  They helped me sort out problems with customs, provided excellent business service and help finding alternative rooms for disgruntled colleagues. The outdoor pool area provides an excellent relaxing place for an evening meal as well as a beautiful place to swim. With India Gate and the sea immediately outside of the front door the setting could not have been better."
"Service: 10/10 Cleanliness: 10/10 Location: 10/10 Breakfast: 10/10  Friendly Staff, Outstanding Service, Perfect Location, Very Nice Pool.  Simply the best stay and service you get in Mumbai, Highly Recommended..."
"The Taj at Mumbai is an exceptional hotel. Quite unique, and different from any other hotel. It has a history. But what sets it apart is its high standards of service. The rooms are well appointed, the sea facing ones particularly have an outstanding view, the restaurants are amongst the best in the city. Stay at this hotel makes the visit to Mumbai special."
"I cannot praise the hotel to much, immaculate service, beautiful rooms, plenty of places to dine, beautiful pool, what else can I say? My room was serviced twice a day, butler service if required, with a concierge service second to none. What else can I say, simply the best hotel I have ever been to."
"Had another wonderful stay here. Coincided with my big birthday, the housekeeping staff made a real fuss balloons, cake, beautiful flowers, foot bath, special bath salts, face packs I felt very special just wish the face packs took years off me Thank you everyone at the Taj"
"we went to the bar near the lobby which was pretty good. Wanted to go upstairs to the sea view bar , but for what ever reason we were not allowed to. Service was great and the martinis where on point. drinks are cheaper than the food."
"From the moment you step on the door you feel the fresh air of the Taj, not only because the fresh flowers everywhere but because you feel like Kings and Queens as soon as you walk in. The staff makes anything and everything possible to make you feel like royalty. Including the little ones. Thanks for giving me and my family a wonderful experience. The memories will last a life time. Always thankful for your service and all the little and small details that made a difference in our stay."

Others avoidable.   - Cake shop - Great!  - Cuisines - X-cellent"
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel as part of the weekend stay. To be honest it was so much better than we expected. Apart from receiving a wonderful upgrade to a suite as part of our AMEX Fine Hotel and Resorts package, the service in this hotel is exemplary and the cleanliness in this hotel is stunning, For such an icon ( old) hotel the hotel is maintained in a superb way and i could not think of any weaknesses, except mayb that the AirCon in the public places is not (always) working strongly. A minor detail!... apart from this a special recommendation has to go to Wasabi by Morimoto - this is an amazing restaurant and the quality of the japanese food is just outstanding, yes it is probably the most expensive place in Mumbai but ocnsidering that 90 percent of the food"
"I've always wanted to stay at the Taj Mahal Mumbai and this was that final moment in the form of a staycation! The Hotel, true to its reputation was beautiful, grand and had impeccable service. Their attention to detail when it came to service was outstanding. There's nothing they really say no to and go out of their way to ensure you're content. They mad our special day even more special, along with allowing us to sink in our beds a little longer with a late check-out and indulgent pampering of delicious chocolates. We stayed in the Heritage wing which had its old world charm meets modern technology elements to ensure a more pleasant stay and kept the entire room absolutely cozy and cute. The only thing I'd complain about is random noises at night but apart from that the hotel"
It is rare in my experience to stay in a hotel where you feel that it is a privilege to be a guest. I say that as an outstanding compliment.The Taj Mahal Palace is such a hotel. My wife and I made a special trip to Mumbai just to stay at the Taj for 2 days. The place lived up to and exceeded its reputation for quality and excellence as well as superb hospitality in every respect. We also felt that it represented good value as compared with many 5 star establishments. Do not turn down the opportunity to stay there!
having nive butler service but house keeping service is quit bad and i was shocked for this Lounge service is quit good we can give 4 star for lounge service and the airport drop or pickup service is free only for one side it is also not good if u r giving airport pickup free then u have to give for both side ..
"Magnificent iconic hotel of Mumbai.  If you can afford to stay for a night or two I would highly recommend.  Step back into of time of extravagance and luxury, but it comes at a price.  Check in was fast and efficient. We had a suite with a sea view overlooking the India Gate and water.  Beautifully appointed room with beautiful marble bathroom.  This hotel is very large but maintained to a very high standard.  Staff were courteous, efficient and friendly.  Breakfast is available in several areas and is the usual fare, with buffet or off menu.  Pool area is large with plenty of sunbeds, some under cover.  The only fault I found was the service in the outdoor area was a little slow at times.   There is a daily after noon tour of the hotel for those interested in the history.  It"
Always wanted to visit this hotel having seen documentaries about it on UK TV (including the terrible tragedy of 2008). We were not disappointed. In my opinion this is probably one of the best hotels we have stayed in anywhere in the world!!!
What a wonderful experience we had celebrating my birthday. From the minute you step into this world of opulence you are treated like Royalty. Nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff who genuinely want to please you. The old Palace wing is so beautiful and steeped in history. All the restaurants are first class and the large swimming pool is a haven to relax by. Highly recommended
"Would not stay anywhere else in Mumbai… The personnel is extraordinary, very helpful and welcoming.  The food is fantastic. One must try the Lebanese restaurant on the top floor which has a marvellous view over Mumbai . The food there is delicate and very tasty. The location is fantastic."
"The Staff, the historic building and the whole experience were excellent. I really would recommend this hotel to anyone in Bombay. Close to the King George Gate and the famous street market, there is much to see and do outside."
"V POOR HOSPITALITY ,  Especially Golden dragon, Masala kart pls avoid going with family,  pls book your tables in advance or u will b shown cold face , no matter u r with kids,you r staying in that hotel , u will b shown door to get out and wait! Pathetic  No worth for your penny. pls opt for any restaurant from outside even Brittania and company allowed me a table even thou it had huge waiting que"
A place you have to stay at once in your lifetime ! Perfect service & accommodation.  Mumbai without a stay in this wonderful hotel is only half the real feeling. Worth the price - perfectly located for sightseeing. Stay in the old building !  Always & again.....
Stayed here on the 18 to 22 April for our anniversary. It was a very memorable stay. Our room was beautifully decorated and we were surprised with an anniversary cake. Loved the Taj and want to come back soon.
"We stayed two nights here on our way home from Goa, I wish we had stayed longer! The level of service from all the staff was amazing. The room was incredible, especially the bathroom. The architecture beautiful and to see the Gateway to India and the sea beyond whilst eating breakfast was a treat!"
"the moment we arrived at the airport, we were warmly greeted and chauffeured back to the hotel.  No bother about waiting to check in at reception , we were whisked up to our lovely pool facing room and did it in comfort, brilliant idea for weary jet lagged guests! After a good nights sleep in those huge comfy beds, down to the brilliant buffet breakfast, where most tastes are catered for and the staff most efficient and"
"Everything about this hotel is just excellent. The service you receive is phenomenal. Cannot wait to visit this hotel again. Amazing. The decor, the food, the comfort, the service and quality is just great."
Can't say enough good things about this hotel. It's more expensive than the places I usually stay at but absolutely worth it.  The staff are absolutely first class. A great end to my trip through India.
"An excellent home away from home. Faclilities, restaurants, decor, room, gym ad above all the people. Words are deficient to explain the people and their genuinity. he peple make all the difference where they not only know yo by your anme but also what the preferences are right from food, to flowers, to spa treatments etc. In short you think of what yor likes are and its in the room. No words can explan the stay andhe happiness we got"
"I really liked the Taj Mahal Palace, the location was great the view from the room was beautiful and as it was our anniversary they decorated the room. The security is  tight as you enter the hotel but I was glad of this.  We ate dinner at Wasabi and the food was fantastic. Would have loved to stay for longer at the hotel and try out some of the other restaurants but was just a quick stopover."
"We stayed here as a couple in Feb 2015, for our first trip to India. The Hotel is 5 star and certainly offered a first class experience. The service is exceptional, as you would expect. The staff are so attentive and in the garden area they provide cold water and fresh fruit refreshments whilst sunbathing around the pool. There are various restaurants available for breakfast and so much choice. The Salmon and scrambled eggs were the best ever. The room was very plush and best mini bar ever. You feel very special staying in this hotel and we look forward to hopefully staying again in the not too distant future. If you are going to Mumbai, then you must try and go the extra mile and stay here, a short walk outside takes you to the 'Gateway to India' and a ferry trip to Elephant"
We upgraded to the palace section of the hotel which was well worth the money. The decor is amazing and the staff very attentive although the butler didn't bring me the cigar that I ordered. The view from the room was good the streets nearby are good to wonder down. There is very high security at this hotel but it's nice to feel safe in such a busy city.  
"There are occasions when you are drawn to review a place just because you want to share something rather than the fact that it's any real use. This is one of those times for me. The Taj Mahal Palace doesn't really need any more five star reviews to convince you to stay there or give guidance on what to do because it is quite simply excellent in every aspect. Both my partner and i agree its the best hotel we have ever stayed in although to be honest we aren't exactly luxury travellers that often.  Take the tour round the hotel while you are there and relax in anyone of the superb restaurants and if you need anything at all the staff will sort it out for you in a flash.  Quite frankly it was worth the trip to India just to stay here, don't miss Mumbai off your list of places to"
"What a great stay ! A beautiful room, many many great memories and a fabulous trip overall! Not to forget, some of the best food in a long time! Must check out the breakky buffet at Shamiana and the high tea at Sea Lounge."
"An outstanding customer service, a top of class bedroom quality and specifically bed itself, an excellent variety of high class restaurants and bars. Say less but mean more. For business trip or family getaway or whatever reason it is, I will come back here for sure."
"Great hotel. Lovely room, restaurants and a pool! Would want to stay again. My favourite was breakfast in the harbour bar - so much variety. Can spend time wondering around the hotel , also the tour at 5 everyday is a great touch."
"We  have just been  for our second  visit to the  taj. We did not think  it could it be better than the  first, but it was. The service  is second to no other hotel  we have ever visited. The staff recognised  us by name . The  rooms are immaculate  in design and creativity.  We had flower petals arranged  on the floor , superb yet again. The palace  wing is the place  to  stay.  The  Aquarius restaurant is in our view the best. It's near the pool and great for breakfast, lunch and a great barbecue dinner this is a credit to  the  manager Mr shekhar who with his staff made our holiday  special.  Again  there is no place like the taj mahal palace  in India "
"The hotel is certainly steeped in history and in parts beautiful. I was a little disappointed with the room, fusty smell and a little worn. The staff tried very hard and in general the service was good. The food and beverage was good, but expensive. The pool area is definitely a bonus well serviced and a tranquil oasis at the end of a hot and busy day - The Palace rooms are far superior to those in the tower and worth the extra you pay."
"The stay at the taj palace hotel is a dream come true each and every single time.... !!! From being received to the departure , it's like butter on toast. But just to be on d safe side , at the time of departure give them more than an hours notice to get your bills ready!!!! Looks like they don't like to see the guests go.... :) courtesy and hospitality at its epitomised best."
Excellent!!!!   It is a small word for the Salon's Hospitality and the ADVICE that they give. The STAFF is very good and tends to remember every SMALL detail of the customer so as to give better and better service.   NO FLAWS FOUND....
"There may likely be better business hotels in Mumbai, but for a tourist... this is the top of the line.  The hotel itself is one of the big sight seeing places in a city full of places you need to see...  and the history of the owner/builder is amazing.  We spent a wedding anniversary there and were treated like royalty.  We got an upgrade on the American Express plan, and then they gave us another upgrade to be nice.  Mumbai is an exciting and also crowded/ noisy city... so retreating after adventures to one of the finest luxury hotels in the world makes the adventure of being in the center of so much exploding wonder... calm.  You are also right across the street from the ""Gate Way"" one of a million must see tourist attractions.  The rooms in the remodeled part (after the"
"We stayed here in 2014 and loved it. We've stayed at Taj's for over 10 years and had great stays. However, this year we have been very disappointed in Taj quality, guest experience and customer service at 6 of their India hotels, but none were as bad as this. We returned to the Taj Mahal expecting an oasis of ease and comfort again, but instead experienced the worse hotel stay i've ever had in 36 years of travel. In case you don't read to the end (sorry its rather long) the main highlights were my partner in the shower having filthy dirty water coming out of the shower after an apparent burst pipe, and being left covered in that muck for 3.5 hours while the staff ran around and didn't know what to do. They couldn’t even bring a bucket of clean water to the room when he asked so"
We cheated and only called in here for a drink in the harbour bar. Took the opportunity to have a nosey around and can definitely see why this the place to be. Absolutely stunning everywhere we looked.            Can only imagine the whole hotel is to the same standard.
"We were a part of UKs delegation and got to enjoy the perks of the palace like hotel which underwent through terrorist attacks a few years prior.  The hotel looked like a part of history and gave us a very grand and warm welcome like feeling.  Price wise it was one of the most expensive but the best in the whole of Mumbai with an open garden coffee shop in the centre of the hotel.  Room service, food and all the amenities were just of a 5 star, there isn't more of a need to describe Te food and services as it is a 5 star.  We did have to undergo through some patience while checking in to the hotel as the security procedures and concierge service were a bit slow."
"The palace wing is wrapped in history, once inside you close your eyes to imagine the sounds of horse carriages bringing travellers from the harbour, as they arrive with their Louis Vuitton suit cases and waiting at the lobby to be greeted by the hotel staff.... The room facing the sea has the view of many coloured Yahts and ships.... The ceiling fan, the oversized bed and the jaaali work is a mix of quentissential Indian design integrated with colonial architecture.  The palace lounge with its torqouise shades and oversized paintings.... As you sip your coffee looking overlooking the busy street and the sea  The poolside after sunset is buzzing with guests' chatter, with occasional sound of the splashing water from the swimming pool.....   The art collection is good, and the"
"A wonderful time spent at this most glorious and iconic hotel property. We decided to cut our visit short to Goa by one night in order to stay a night in the Taj. So glad we did. From the pick up at the airport, to the private check in, the lounge facility, the staff, the ambience.....everything was just wonderful. Full of the most smiley, happy staff. Can't wait to visit again."
"Stayed April 16 for 3 nights and I have to say it is THE BEST hotel I have stayed in. The staff, the attention to detail, levels of service and the general feel of the place are genuinely second to none. The room was spotless, and kept that way with nice touches to enhance the experience. Concierge service was faultless, breakfast delicious and would definitely recommend staying here if in Mumbai."
"I stayed in the new section of The Taj Mahal Palace in October. It was okay although I have the impression that the rooms in the original building are more impressive.   The room had a damp musty smell. The bathroom had a shower, no bath. The bedroom and bathroom linen was of good quality, and the room was very spacious.   The conference facilities were very good.   The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The gym was large, well-equipped, and had a number of treadmills, which was great.  The personal instructor was very attentive.   The pool was large and private, very well maintained.   The hotel is conveniently situated opposite the Gateway to India which is a buzz of activity 24 hours a day. You can take a quick 5 minute walk to the main street for shopping -"
Stayed there for a week and loved it! The place is beautiful and well taken care of with many hotel workers in every corner. Loved the room service twice a day with small little surprises that makes you want to come back to the room and find them.  Breakfast with the pool view and changing variety of Indian food is wonderful.  The swimming pool is large enough for laps.  This is the place to stay in and have the colonialist feeling and still be in the heart of the bustling city. 
"A beautiful architectural marvel near gate way of India,this hotel has very good and co-operative staff .Beautiful interior with very good cleanliness, good food and elegance par excellence.Inside even the visitor including foreigners give you good smiles which look familiar even to strangers.The elegance of this hotel outshines number of other hotels in the city.A nice place to stay."
"The hotel is awesome, staff is friendly and professional. Bar & Sea Lounge is very nice to sit. Food in Indian restaurant is horrible and pricey - avoid. Chinese restaurant Dragon...is always busy, so without booking in advance, its impossible to go there for a group."
"Mumbai was our first stop on our tour of India this Easter. We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for 3 nights and were really wowed by the whole stay. We had originally booked a new tower room but were delighted that upon check-in, we were kindly upgraded to a room on the third floor of the old hotel. This made such a huge difference to our stay. The room was gorgeous- plush and comfortable. The bed was glorious and we slept very well for our 3 nights. Each morning we got up early and got to the Sea View restaurant when it opened so that we could get a good view across India Gate of the sun coming up and we could start our sightseeing in the slightly cooler temperature. The view was truly mesmerising and breakfast was a real treat. In the afternoons after spending most the day"
"Excellent in every area.   If you're staying in Mumbai once in your life don't stay anywhere else.  Flowers, décor, staff, food, service are all exceptional.   Great location in down town Mumbai, central to all the local haunts."
A splendid hotel right by the gateway to India . This gateway is a busting hub of activity and pigeons!!!  Nothing to do with thd hotel but we were very unwell whilst here. Fortunately our room looked out over the water and the entrance where Prince William and Kate arrived. So seeing our royal family was great entertainment. The locals enjoyed seeing them but were more excited by the Bollywood stars who arrived for the evening reception!  This hotel has the most wonderful staircase and the most helpful and attentive staff. Thank you
A great place to stop for some pastries and refreshments.  World class hotel with a superior look.  Pricey to stay at.  They have a great bakery on the ground floor serving cakes and sandwiches which were terrific.  Hotel has much history.
"We stayed for three nights at the Taj Palace during March and had booked a room in the tower section of the hotel, knowing that we would still have access to all the wonderful facilities.  On arrival we were very pleasantly surprised to be up-graded to a fourth floor room in the main palace building. This was beautifully furnished, incredibly spacious and very well equipped. The attention of all the service personnel was exceptional and we were very impressed with every one of the hotel's employees.  Breakfast was a real treat and we ate in the Sea Lounge positioned in the main building. One evening we also ate in one of the restaurants, which was a lovely experience, but there are many restaurants to be found locally which are interesting and very good value.  We joined the"
"I consider the property as identity of our great country. Staff and Management are found attached to their workplace. For me, the place where we work is NOT merely a source of income, but everybody should work for higher excellence and to create a point of inspiration for others. Wish this kind of attitude be developed across the country. Feel proud to have associated and wish the same in the decades to come."
"We have travelled the globe staying at various Hotels along the way.Some good some not so good. The Taj Palace Hotel definitely takes the icing on the cake. Apart from the comfortable ambience, bright, clean and refreshing the STAFF are excellent and I give them 5 stars.The  Essential to details is par excellent.Every guest is treated as a VIP. They are charming , courteous and extremely obliging to pamper your whims and fancy. Credit indeed to Mr. Mehernosh Kapadia and Staff for making our stay at the Taj most happy and comfortable."
"After the noise of Delhi, the quiet of Bandhavgah and the colours of Jaipur, I was met by the excitement of Mumbai where there is no better place to rest ones head than the iconic Taj Mahla Palace Hotel.  Unfortuntely the welcome was not what I was expecting as I was confronted by the fact that the travel agent had not fully paid for the room charge. Given that I was going to be there for 2 nights I felt this could have been dealt with in a totally different way as opposed to making me feel very uncomfortable for 15 mins; hence the reason for downgrading from Excellent to Very Good.  Customer service for me is far more important than the esthetics of an hotel. Room 360 was almost opposite the gateway to India with the bay full of all manner and size of boats. At night I could"
The special little things that make this hotel an experience is coming back to your room and finding flower arrangements made of petals on your floor as you open the door or a small gift on your bed. A rose on your pillow. You are truly spoilt and made to feel incredibly special from the moment you arrive.
Excellent hospitality by Mr.Karkaria....staff was very good....food awesome...housekeeping always at beck n call....butler at hand 7* experience.Situated at the Gateway TO India in the heart of the city our room offered a great view of the Arabian sea.
"The hotel is 113 years young and it is the preferred destination of the Kings,  aristocrats and corporate heads.   Taj has retained it's heritage to provide an awesome customer experience through its service.   The hotel retains it's old world charm and yet provides all the modern amenities as possible."
Wow what a hotel amazing .. Seriously i love this hotel among all the hotels in mumbai the most ... Awsome quality of interior of the room ... The best place in mumbai to stay and from this hotel what a view of gateway of india and the sea .. M just loving it red_heart
"The Taj Mahal Hotel is the pride of India. Besides luxury things, the hotel has beautiful architecture and marvelous history. There are many historical things which you should visit and explore in the corridor."
We were lucky to visit the hotel for After Noon High Tea and it was amazing. Expecting only scones and cakes we were pleasantly surprised to be confronted with a great selection of hot food. Drinks were also on offer and the service was first class. Being on the second floor it has a great view if the water front.
The name of the Tata's signifies excellence in India and this Flagship Hotel of The Tata's is a landmark hotel in the history of Bombay. A journey to India is incomplete without a stay in the great hotel. President Obama & President Clinton have both stayed here along with many Presidents & Prime Ministers as well as Kings & Queens of Various Countries. An Absolute must property to stay in the World
"A great Hotel of history and present day time! Warm welcome, nice palace-sea view room (251) great breakfast with international and Indian touch. Love the bathroom and esp.the view from this nice room. The pool and health facilities are great and the really big pool (0pen from 6 am to 10 pm!) helps you to cool and de-stress. The place to be in Mumbai !"
Great week end at Taj Mahal Hotel. Wonderful place. Historical building.  Magic atmosphere. First class swimming pool.  Outstanding Service. Very well located. Worth a visit for and unforgettable week end
You'll be treated like Royalty - no other way to put it! The breakfast buffet is better than any you've ever seen on a cruise line. Even your elevator ride with floor selection are done for you. The BEST!
Do not miss a visit to this hotel Alas could not stay there but did have a wonderful afternoon tea Arrived at 4.15 and finally left at 6.45 Staff were lovely  Service exquisite  All the food lovely Pianist played unobtrusively throughout Then had drink in one of the bars Do not miss experience  Cost 1800 and well worth it Would love to do again
"Had a great Experience staying at the Taj Mahal Palace & Towers Hotel at Mumbai (Appolo Bunder). Stayed on the 15th floor of the Tower wing with breath taking views of the Arabian sea & the Gateway of India.  The Heritage Tour of the Hotel was a great experience. Learning about its glorious past, the long list of Kings, Queens, country heads, celebs who have stayed at this iconic property.. Makes you feel special.  TAJ Hospitality makes you feel relaxed & comfortable and the food is amazing.  Lot of activities to do around in a walkable 2-3 Km radius.  Had a great time with family.  Next visit would be to spend a night at the Heritage Wing. its a next level of luxury."
"Food was good, accomodation was good houskeeping staff was very nice beautiful rooms stunning decor . Yoga mat yoga cards jhumka and many more things. Proper service in the time .Service  staff good ,service up to the mark....!! Lovely hotel nice one . Good work keep it up, no doubt it is worth of the money. "
"Amazing.  The history, the ambiance, the beauty, the elegance ... This is a world class hotel.  I was upgraded to a suite in the older part of the hotel and could not have been more impressed.  Staff were exceptionally friendly and I felt cared for and accommodated during my entire stay.  I looked lost once and a staff member noticed and brought me far out of his way to my destination. Small things like this make guests feel special. The Taj is a very, very special place indeed.  "
"We stayed 2 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. We were in room 704 in the Tower side of the hotel.  The room was comfortable, with the normal room furnishings -- a nice bed, a TV, a minbar, a safe, etc. The room had a screened balcony overlooking the Gateway of India. This was the best part of the room.  We ate in the courtyard one night, and had two breakfasts at the top of the Tower, and a light lunch at the Sea Lounge. The meals were all good, but not exceptional. And the service we got was OK and friendly, but nothing to rave about.  From reading other reviews, you should really stay in the Palace side of the hotel to get rooms and service that are exceptional. The Tower side is just like many another good hotel.  The view out the window/balcony was always interesting."
"in The Taj Mahal Palace tea was ausum and service was very good and love the tea was ausum...The service was first class from start to finish...he location is perfect - a beautiful view of the Gateway whilst being close to the buzzing areas of Colaba, Fort and Kala Ghoda. My favourite things were the flower arrangements ..."
We have stayed in this hotel many times over the years and it is still one of the best in the world in my opinion.  I recommend a room with a view of the gate of india. Club rooms are great and restaurants serve a variety of food.
"Entering the Taj is like entering another world. The history surrounds you. Highly recommended. Arrival experience was unlike any other hotel, food is excellent, and wonderful harbor views from the top floor restaurant."
"five nights in Mumbai . Beautiful room good service  breakfast should have more choice.Very well located to discover the old british colonial city and to have diner in several restaurants .From the hotel you can walk to visit the city , a secure area if you do not want to take a taxi all time"
Love this hotel that is so central in Mumbai. You can lie by the beautiful pool & feel you are in India not just in any hotel in a big city. Th service is excellent & staff so helpful. The breakfast buffet is second to none & nothing is too much for the staff.
"The service was first class from start to finish, with stunning decor and a high level of comfort in both the room and the communal areas. The location is perfect - a beautiful view of the Gateway whilst being close to the buzzing areas of Colaba, Fort and Kala Ghoda. My favourite things were the flower arrangements (stunning!) and the peaceful Palace Lounge.   I was left gifts in my room e.g. a beautiful teal scarf one day and bangles/ chandla/ jhumka another. A yoga teacher visited me one day and when the staff got to know they sent a yoga mat and yoga cards to my room to use whilst there. These little touches made me feel special - thanks to housekeeping on floor 3 of the Palace wing.  Thank you Saswata for the Palace room and a huge thanks to Ramdas (breakfast - Sea Lounge)"
"Nice rooms with a classic atmosphere clean,  nice toilets and good size room . The breakfast is one of the best full of options and variety  Service standard is high and the staff are customer oriented  The old court is recommended Some issues could be resolved for beter stay like connected rooms for families and some facilities for Muslim's such as shut off in toilets and Winks direction "
"Had a fabulous stay at the hotel. The hospitality of TAJ is no.1, Awesome Location. and its also a privilege to stay in this hotel, its not only me but all guest arriving from abroad all prefer this Heritage Hotel."
"A luxurious, beautiful, decadent hotel exuding class. From the moment we arrived at the entrance, in our old taxi picked up at the airport, to the moment we left, we were made to feel like royalty and felt that everyone was treated the same. Always a smile on the faces of the staff, always there to have a chat about the day and your plans, and I believe it was their pleasure to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The beautiful bedroom, the huge bath, and shower, the swimming pool and surrounds, the lush breakfasts, the cup of tea and biscuits in the reading room every day made it difficult for us to want to venture out of the hotel. We had originally booked for the Tower Wing but were upgraded, immediately on arrival, to the Palace rooms. I actually would"
Room and bath was so poor. We left the hotel on 2 nd day at 03:00 a.m. but they charged from us full day additionally they did not offer us to give small breakfast with us.    Staff was so kind and smiling.
"Absolutely wonderful hotel,  we stayed for two nights just before our flight back to UK and it was everything one could want.  Staff could not have been more helpful and there was a large deep pool as well.  the view from the restaurant at the top of the new tower was amazing.  fantastic place to have breakfast.  we don't often spend so much on hotels but it was definitely worth it."
The hotel is so beautiful with a lovely heritage look overlooking the sea. Taj hospitality can never be complained and as always the best here too. The food here is really nice. Thanks for taj group to make our stay comfy and memorable 
"Everything about Taj in Bombay is about being treated like a king with a private entourage and a butler. Spectacular no doubt but wayyyyy over priced. Almost 25% taxes on top of your food bill (which is overpriced to begin with). Depending on where you eat at the hotel, the food is gringo to authentic so ask around. You will create many memories here as long as you can afford it. Value for money is not good but it's the Taj!"
Enjoy the hotel's hospitality and warm reception . Awelcome from everyone .They facilitating all my requirement. The views of room very beautiful and comfortable and the service is quick . the restaurant distinguishes meals variety  won my pleasure and I hope to repeat my experience with you again
"This hotel is one of the finest in the world.  I have been to many countries and experienced many different hotels.  The customer Service, cleanliness, food, ambiance of the hotel....so elegant.  It would be a shame to be in the vicinity of this masterpiece and miss the experience."
"Overall the Taj did not meet my expectations, and I feel that for what I paid, I could have had a better hotel more centrally located. The service was superb throughout my stay and cannot be faulted. What lets the hotel down is the room decor, which in my opinion is dated and needs to be refreshed. The bathroom only has a fixed shower head, which for me was a big let down as I prefer a flexi shower head. In a 5 star establishment, slippers, toothbrush and shaving kit etc should already be in the room, without having to be asked for.   The breakfasts lacked variety, not enough authentic Indian dishes for my liking. Location is not great if you need to get in to BKC, Andheri, Bandra or the airport. Typically we were spending 90 minutes in a cab getting there."
"A day well spent at the TAJ MAHAL PALACE. Comfortable and well maintained rooms. The staff and their hospitality was nice. The food served was good. Nothing to complain of, overall a wonderful experience."
"We have travelled to many many places, and the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel rates amongst the best we ever been to.  In a 5 star rating system, I rate The Taj Mahal Palace hotel  10 stars. The hotel staff is the best in any hotel that we have ever stayed at. They make you feel at home and make sure that anything you could possibly want is there for you."
This is the second time we have stayed here. We tried a Tower Room after staying in the Heritage wing last time. Our room was on floor 14 and had a balcony and had a lovely view over the city. Everything was of high standard - particularly the service. The breakfast buffet in the Shamiana was extensive and delicious. For a special occasion however I would recommend the Heritage Wing - the decor is quite stunning and there is a magical ambience.
"A must experience for anyone visiting Mumbai.Incredible service, the world's most friendly staff and beautiful swimming pool.Must be one of the world's greatest hotels.View ,ambience,history are its greatest asset's."
Its simply awesome. Hotel is superb. Food is also too good. Hospitality is overwhelming. Great experience. Staying at Taj Mahal Palace is like dream come true. Swimming pool is also very good. Just feel they should allow diving from their depth side of pool.
I always attend the afternoon high tea when in Mumbai at the taj hotel.  Wonderful selection of treats and friendly waiters and always a super relaxing environment with the pianist playing in the background. The view is wonderful and sitting at the window is a must!  U will be returning on my next visit to mumbai!
"its an iconic building reminds of luxury of past and present, take a full tour, it is same hotel that witnessed terrorist attack and hotels staff unpredendented care and courage to help their guest. food like all taj is wonderful. spend a day if not a hotel guest, must book an old wing room"
"Had a fabulous stay over 3 nights. The staff are friendly and the service great . The atmosphere is regal and steeped in history. The breakfast unbelievable and catering for every taste. Loved it all. Location within easy reach of Colaba with its myriad attractions. Shopping, restaurants, galleries. Good rates can be got on line. "
"The Taj was a great experience.  I was unwell when we arrived and I could recouperate in peace and quiet. We stayed in the old wing with a lovely view out to sea, and and the room was very comfortable. The restaurants were all good but the breakfast was abit challenging if you were looking for some clean, healthy options besides juice and cut fruit. Too much cooked, fattening food. unfortunately!"
"I stayed here for two nights with a friend. I am a gold inner circle card holder so have obviously stayed at a few Taj hotels.  We were allocated a room on the 15th floor - newer part of the hotel. What a let down. There was nothing special about the room and it was very noisy. Not only from other guests but banging and drilling in the corridor all weekend.  Breakfast was ok. The first day was a bit of a shambles - food we ordered did not arrive & the same with drinks. The second morning we were served by Laxman - he was very good, efficient, helpful and very polite.  Check in and check out experiences were fine but this hotel, particularly for the room we stayed in was well over priced and I would recommend the Oberoi to friends in the future over here.  Didn't feel special,"
"My wife and I stayed here during a visit to Mumbai for 2 nights as part of a 26 day journey throughout India. I have visited the hotel before and had drinks etc there, but this was my first stay. We were accommodated in the Tower wing, our room was very comfortable and we had an amazing view to the Gateway to India monument, right in front of us. The only issue spoiling the view was the mesh over the balcony, presumably to prevent falls, but this did spoil somewhat the potential for photography. Service was impeccable even to receiving foot baths, and a very nice business card holder. I don't know if these things are normal service, but if so  they are very nice touches. Breakfast was very good, and again impeccable service. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel as went out with"
"splendid, historical and hotel with proud and useless executives and staff. staff especially reservation, front desk were extremely haughty and non friendly. catering staff focussed on their manners rather than service to clients. food was tasteless. despite such a great location, i would never prefer to stay at this hotel again. hotel oberoi is a much better bargain for less price with equally good location, great food and greatest service staff"
this hotel is a tourist attraction in mumbai and maximum tourists who come to visit india particularly mumbai stay in this hotel. it shows the true tradition and culture of india and the service given is just amazing.
"Top class service, great food and all for a lot less than you would pay in a modest  London hotel.  Excellent location but beware Mumbai traffic.  Amazing heritage building and beautifully looked after.  Nothing too much trouble."
"My third visit to The Taj. It is the most wonderful hotel with scrupulous attention to detail. It has a stunning swimming pool and excellent gym, the rooms are kept beautifully and you will get many extra treats like roses on your pillow. The staff are all lovely from the sweep to the management and everyone goes out of their way to help. There is nothing to complain about, they have everything covered!"
"Simply put: There's the Taj Palace in Mumbai, and then there are all the rest. A celebration of contrasts: Traditional, yet contemporary. Western indulgences, eastern sensibility. Ethnically attired staff with impeccable service and flawless English (or Hindi). An Indian hotel facing a colonial monument (the Gateway of India) overlooking the Arabian Sea.  A stay to remember for us. We stayed in a plush, sea-facing room on the top floor of the Palace wing. There's a reason why it was targeted a few years back... it's beautiful and speaks to all that's good about India. Understated, gracious hospitality. Colonial decor with cane furniture, wood beamed ceilings, a Belgian chandelier and fixtures from an E.M. Forster novel. No over-the-top baroque gaudiness.  The breakfast at the"
"Super Place, super royale feel you will have after visiting this hotel, great treatment by the super co-operative staff, amazing ambiance, vintage feel with some of the hotel collection, you truly feel proud being such structure in Mumbai"
"We spent 3 1/2 nights here (kept our room for a 01.40am flight back to London) early April. We had room 550 in the Palace, which gave us access to the Club facilities on the ground floor. The service in the hotel is second to none. All the staff and smiling, polite, engaged and dedicated to making sure all guests have a wonderful experience. One tip - for breakfast go to the top floor restaurant in the Tower Wing. It has fabulous views, is light and airy and so much quieter than the Sea Lounge or the main coffee shop, as well as being less fiercely air conditioned. We were amazed to see queues for tables outside the Sea Lounge and coffee shop, whereas we were able to walk in and sit down by the window each morning in the Tower Wing. We've stayed here a number of times before and"
"This is a must do, excellent variety of Indian snacks and cakes. Surrounds are fabulous and it does not  matter if you are a visitor or guest of the hotel, everyone treated the same. Chef brought out tasters to the table and explained the dish. The hotel itself is well worthy of its reputation and everyone was very accommodating and explained its history and splendor. 5 stars, thank you Taj for a wonderful and memorable visit."
"What a waste of space  Over rated Smelly Terrible food Terrible room service   Never , ever again   Being an Indian, I wanted to fly the flag    Sorry! Not for this establishment  Everything had to b asked for"
"As it turned out Prince William and Kate's stay at the hotel coincided with our stay at the hotel. Remarkably no guest was ever inconvenienced because the guest is clearly King at this remarkable venue. We had every opportunity to view William and Kate's ceremony and view the ball from the atrium of the hotel .We received an unexpected upgrade from the tower to the palace .The breakfasts, service and atmosphere places this hotel in the category of the very best."
We went for afternoon tea to the Taj at the Sea Lounge .I  am going to give this place 3 stars .I come from Dubai where we are accustomed to very posh 5 star service.We visited India and popped in for tea.The waiter refused to give us  wifi access because we were not residents of the hotel. (BIZARRE) Anywhere else in the world you get a wifi access if you are a guest in a hotel .Tea was nice and they served a nice biscotti as well.I ordered a Falooda which was a dissapointed no fancy frills just a blob of ice cream over a pink and white liquid. Dissed ! 
"One of the beautiful heritage property located in the heart of the city - Mumbai .. Taj Mahal Palace .. is truly an awesome experience to stay if you ever plan to visit India. Since childhood, I have always admired this beautiful architectural property and would wonder when will be the day come when i could actually get a chance to stay at the lavish property. ..  Finally, I feel blessed that I got an opportunity to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace. .. less of words to express the joy as a kid to experience strolling in the lobby area till the pool side .. breathtaking view of the sunrise and sunset view from my room and the Arabian sea view along with the gateway of India at the breakfast table ...well mannered,  courteous and polite staff ... Dont miss the delicious chocolate"
"We stayed for a night in one of the Palace wing rooms, which I would recommend if you are staying here, rather than the tower wing, as it's part of the original hotel. The room was beautifully decorated and spacious with a great bath! The service was impeccable and all the staff were very friendly and attentive. There was also excellent attention to detail and added extras which makes it a special experience. The breakfast was a highlight too, with every breakfast food you could imagine being provided! I'd say its a must stay if you are visiting Mumbai as its a little Oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city and a great historical building."
"Fantastic situation just on Gateway Great breakfast Big swimmpool just in the heart of south Mumbai Nice personal  We spent 8 days for a trip. Not the first time in Mumbai but the first time in Taj. Really good situation in colaba, near a lot of places."
"A hotel that has it all. Great charm, great food, great service and such a marvelous sense of history!. And, you are right next door to the Gates of India!! The hotel is divided into two sections: one is old fashioned and very Colonial. The other is all modern and up to date."
"The service here is first rate-- attentive, efficient and genuinely warm.  A few aspects feel a little more typical tourist hotel, with some business in the restaurant hall that undercuts the serene atmosphere elsewhere, and the renovations, but staff lovely."
"Having read, heard, and seen so much about the Taj Mahal Palace, and having crept in for a quick look-see about 10 years ago, we were constantly impressed by the consistent levels of service in this amazing place.  Having opted for the luxury touch of the hotel chauffeur from the airport, we learned much about the city and its environs as we drove, and the co-ordination between driver and reception meant that we were met on arrival by our personal receptionist who quickly explained dining details and options, and escorted us to our 18th floor tower room overlooking the Gateway of India. Nothing appeared to be too much trouble and the greeting, courtesy, and attention of staff was memorable and consistent.  Breakfast was excellent with eggs freshly cooked to order, and Indian"
"I had to travel from Canada to center India for business. Chose to stay one night in Mumbai to recover from jet lag. Pick a unique place where i would not have the opportunity to see gain. Why not pay more for a unique experience i told myself! The hotel arranged transportation directly from airport despite i landed at midnight. Excellent service! I requested a standard room, got a free upgrade to a 5 rooms appartment suite... Just magical. The restroom is a 2 rooms suite by itself with marbre from ceiling to floor. Fresh flowers, complementary wine... I felt like a queen. Wow.  The next morning i had the choice to have breakfast by the pool or in the breakfast area. Wonderful and attentionate service, great choice, fanstastic view of the harbor...magnificient gardens and"
"If what you are looking for is to stay at a real palace where the staff make you fell like royalty, then this is the place. The location is right in front of the Gate of India. The hotel grounds are beautiful. The restaurants are top. Everything is just a dream!! highly recommended!"
Very very high quality service Relaxable All Service are available 24/7 Location is very good Perfect opposite of Sea Interior is Unbelievable  5 star  Rate also cheap  Easy to go in hotel Nature is very cool Security is good 
"You won't find a better hotel in the whole world ! The service was simply humbling. I vow to return once a year, for the rest of my life. Nothing is too much for the staff, the atmosphere is very relaxed, at once I felt like a prince."
"We found the staff here most attentive and interested in our comfort and wellbeing.  Our extremely comfortable and well-appointed room overlooked the Gateway to India and the general hustle and bustle along the promenade (busier than usual because it was Holi) - but the double glazing ensured we didn't hear anything we didn't want to.   There is a choice of restaurants - breakfast and snack lunches are available in the Sea Lounge.  We very much enjoyed our tiffins in the Masala Kraft restaurant, and the food in the Golden Dragon.  The prices in the various restaurants were pretty reasonable given the kind of hotel this is.  Hotel staff provide a tour every day explaining the history of the hotel, which was most interesting, and they do not gloss over the terrible events of"
This is a fine old hotel...beautiful and grand and classic.  The location is great and the service is perfect.  The rooms are lovely and quite comfortable.  It was a great launching point to my India adventure.
The Taj Palace is far more than just a hotel. The ambiance is sublime and the service is absolutely without fault. This was my second stay here and will be the only place I will ever stay in Mumbai. Has to be experienced to be appreciated.
"Very poor taste in making guests wait by taking room numbers and calling up when the tables are ready. Not good at all from a 5* hotel. Nor did the staff open the outside tables but showed lack of respect for hotel guests. If I wanted to wait in a queue, then I would have booked a 3* hotel but then I would not expect to wait in queue at this place."
It was an awesome experience staying at Taj. Excellent location and view. The hotel people are also great. Food is yummy. Overall a very good experience. Pool and bar is also enjoyment at this place. Enjoyed a lot at this hotel. Rooms are spacious and one of the best I have visited. 
"Everything was superb, it is difficult to know what to highlight.  All the staff are so attentive and charming.  In the four days we stayed, we found the lady who welcomes you to your table at breakfast was so charming, remembered our name from the second day and our likes of drinks and food, the conciege to room 306 who gave us such a warm welcome and the staff who help you call for the lift and welcome you as if old friends...... but every member of staff could not have done more with their attention and charm.  Our room was in the Tower with the iconic view of The Gateway of India and we would get up just before 06.45 to watch the sunrise over the Arabian Sea.  Loved the evening barbeque around the swimming pool, which was such a relaxing atmosphere.  This is a hotel to"
"My favourite hotel in the world, I stayed here in December 2009 and would love to stay again, it is expensive but life is too short. If you can afford it, stay here. Drinks by the pool, followed by a swim is a must do. The breakfast was five star!"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is an iconic hotel for many reasons. It was the first large hotel in Mumbai, it's location is directly opposite the Gateway of India where the British soldiers left the Empire and it was built by the creator of the Tata Empire who, having been refused entry to a hotel on the basis of his race, decided to build one of his own to welcome everyone. It certainly is a welcoming hotel - It is a beautiful building, the rooms are well decorated and the staff are helpful. Having said that, because it is a busy city hotel, do not expect them to be as courteous and nice as other large hotels outside of Mumbai, e.g. Umaid Bhawan, Oberoi Villas. The hotel as 2 parts - the palace wing - the old part although renovated after the terrorist attack in 2008 and a tower wing."
Overall my stay was comfortable and got a very nice room. The ambience and location is perfect. Lovely heritage property with ever ready to help staff. Only problem we faced was room service food quality. The quantity and quality is inconsistent. In spite of our complaint and giving specific order the food was not of 5 star standard. The management should look into it.
Hotel is gorgeous. Pool and spa are definitely high points. Breakfast is not up to the hotel's image. Downtown location is good except for the overwhelming touts and beggars. Tour of the hotel is corny but worthwhile FHR benefits added to the value of the stay
"Me and my family (3yr and 6 yr) visited Mumbai in November 2015 and we stayed 4 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace. In comparison with other luxury hotels I think the cost is quiet ok. Some things to think about, the hotel has 7 restaurants, some are more popular than others and make sure to book the restaurants in time. The Japanese restaurant is a MUST, it is one of the best Asian restaurants I have visited. The rooms is either located in the ""old"" Taj Mahal palace building or in the Tower. The ambience is much more genuine in the ""old"" Taj mahal buildning than in the Tower. The service is really great and the kids got some toys for free when we arrived to the room. If it is a hot day many people use the pool area and sometimes it was hard to get a sunchair."
"If you are coming to Mumbai you really should stay here.  This historic hotel is located right next to the gateway of India and it exudes old world charm.  It is most certainly not the most modern hotel, or even the grandest hotel I have visited but it is absolutely unique and really very special.     Arriving feels like you are arriving at a grand global melting pot, each car is security searched and guests are welcomed by the many hotel staff wearing grand uniforms of old.  Imagine Arabic men in crisp white cotton with head scarves, Arabic women in silk black flowing garments, alongside rich Indian families and the odd European.  The staff who work here are the jewel in the crown -they make the difference between amazing and sensational.  They are incredible, especially the"
"A fabulous experience. A gorgeous hotel, extremely well situated, kind, attentionate and very professional staff. The rooms were beautiful, spacious and well maintained.  The breakfast was amazing, and the hotel has very good restaurants and great SPA and salon services. The only problem with this hotel is that you do not really want to leave it to go and discover the city."
"Magnificent, marvellous,majestic are few words to express the grandeur of heritage wing, it can only be experienced cant be expressed... Food is brilliant and services are almost perfect...  Excellent, good place to stay for holiday, good staff provides good service too!  Best hotel so far in India, beside Le Meridien Chennai!"
"Beautiful hotel - great location with views across the city. Food choices are vast and high quality. Service is exceptional, all staff were friendly, attentive and helpful with nothing being too much trouble. We look forward to returning to the Taj in the near future!"
"Here is an account of this Hotel as narrated to me by my Husband who stayed there on a short business trip to Mumbai, India.  The hotel is Grand and historical. A plethora of Antiques, collectibles, and vintage decor. it offers a splendid views of the Arabian Sea and Gateway of India.  Rooms have old look but everything was well maintained and neat. Bed with its well-arrayed bedding and big size was quite inviting. Bathroom was no less either - spic and span linen and quality toiletries.  Pool area is well defined and sprawling.  Breakfast was so elaborate and great.  The hotel, despite having a lot of hustle and bustle through out, does not ever fall short of providing impeccable and refined service to its guests who come from all over the world.  Well trained staff takes care"
"This was my first stay with Family in Taj and second stay over all. And both the time i have had very beautiful experience. With Family it was all the more better, the way they treat you is excellent."
"I stayed only for one night but the experience was incredible. From a friendly and smooth check-in to the hassle-free departure, everything was handled very nicely. Plus free wi-fi too! The breakfast spread has lot of choices and is easily one of the best way to start the day. This iconic hotel is close to most of the tourist attractions and walking distance to everywhere in the tourist district. Impeccable service and a friendly attitude is what we found here!"
"Stayed in the Taj Palace Hotel for sadly 1 night in the a Palace room. The service was truly first class, from the arrival and throughout our short stay. The pool area is lovely and we enjoyed some food and a drink sitting by the pool relaxing. Later in the day we enjoyed evening drinks in the Harbour Bar until it closed.   It is the attention to detail that you will notice and the fact that everything just works. I particularly noticed that whenever you asked a member of staff directions to a part of the hotel, they didn't simply tell you, but escorted you.   Breakfast the following morning was delightful, the selection and quality of the food was superb and I enjoyed the best cup of English Breakfast tea I have had for a long time. It was a truly enjoyable, shortly too short a"
"This hotel is conveniently located, is well appointed.  The staff are super helpful, food options are fantastic!  We dined in Sea Lounge both mornings for breakfast & the staff couldn't wait to show us as many Indian delicacies as possible.    We also did the history tour of the hotel which is well worth it as it does give you some perspective on the hotel & area, so make sure you make it along to this."
"Great hotel building n history but hospitality n service was not up to the expectation . Food is fine but not the best you will eat for the price you pay. It is disappointing that hotel tour is only run once a day at 5pm , as we missed due to confused advise given . "
"While I would typically choose to stay at a smaller, boutique property, I decided I couldn't ignore several friends' recommendations that I must stay at The Taj Palace on my trip to Mumbai. My stay and experience from beginning to end was exceptional and did nothing but exceed my expectations!  I chose to book a room in the palace wing and although initially I was a bit sorry I didn't book a sea view I quickly fell in love with my room that faced the side street with the sun streaming through the windows and the quiet of not facing the always busy waterfront. The service in all regards is truly exceptional, the hotel is stunning, and the food delicious. The pool and surrounding terraces and garden are absolutely beautiful.  We used drivers from the hotel for everything from"
"My most recent stay in the Taj was even better than previously. Service issues encountered in the past had been dealt with and am pleased to report that WIFI is now free of charge.  We arrived late and were delighted to be upgraded to the Palace wing. The room faced towards the tower and wasnt the largest but was beautifully furnished and very comfortable.  As an alternative to taking breakfast in the Sea Lounge or Shamiana, hotel guests can enjoy an a la carte breakfast in the gardens at no extra charge. This was wonderful and much more relaxing than braving a buffet.   The public areas are stunning, service is friendly and attentive, and the location in Colaba is perfect, especially for tourists. This is one of the truly great hotels of the world and will always be my first"
"The previous posts tell the story.   We stayed two nights on the 15th floor at the end of a two-week tour of India and the stay was a fantastic way to end our India adventure.  The whole experience, from arriving through to departure, was faultless.  That said, if I was pushed for feedback, the slippers in the room are all small sizes and side plates at the bread/cake stand at breakfast would be useful.  If you venture out, the surrounding areas are hectic and the street beggars can be very persistent.  We tried Leopold’s bar/restaurant (on SBS Marg road) one evening, which was fine.  Just read that Prince William and family are visiting here soon - what better endorsement!"
"Oh what a beautiful hotel this is. Iconic, historic and well worth a stay. As everyone else has already said you just have to have a room in the original part of the hotel - palace wing. The multi storey block beside it (tower wing) could be any hotel anywhere and still comes at a high price.  We only stayed 2 nights and were mid way through a busy independent tour of India. Our room overlooked the Gateway to India and the harbour which sees the sunrise in the morning - fabulous.  The floor butler was keen to serve our every need and arranged for foot soaks in our room, along with balloons, a cake and flowers for our anniversary.  We needed the doctor on arrival who swiftly and throughly diagnosed and treated the problem and the cost of the drugs were extremely low.  All areas"
"A palatial property, with nice views. Good staff. Nice bed with butter like pillows. House keeping department is too good. They handle the crowd with extreme efficiency.  Apart from all the above, their restaurant experience was too bad. Very un-professionally managed. Waiters are behaving as though they are in a Punjabi dhaba. Food is good. But not served properly. If you can afford the discrimination of Indians & foreigners, you may definitely go to the restaurant."
"Was so looking forward to staying at this iconic hotel. Unfortunately it didn't live up to our expectations. We stayed in the Tower wing as there were not any available rooms in the Palace wing. The rooms are tired and dated, the bathroom is very small but clean. The bed is big and comfy and the bed linen was lovely. We were fortunate enough to have a view of the Gateway of India but it was slightly obscured by a mesh grill on the balcony. We could not fault the service from any of the staff. The breakfast can be taken in the main dining hall or on the top floor of the Tower wing, this is a quieter option. The breakfast was top quality as was the room service. The food and drinks were very over priced. There is a coffee shop and pizza express very close by. The hotel is very"
"just perfect, why to give more comment ... but i have to introduce 200 characters. As indicated in the title, this hotel is a legend that has remained modern with a service just as we can dream. Nice pool, nice food, nice decoration, smile. Do I reached 200?"
This hotel is very famous and very old build of Mumbai. This place has story to share for 26/11. There coffee shop is very beautiful and comfortable. Staff of hotel is very helpful and polite. They have amazing view.   
"Quite simply the best hotel I have EVER stayed in.  Service of the highest quality, a hotel which is a tourist masterpiece all of its own - a bit like stepping into the world of Agatha Christie or Poirot! Unforgettable."
"An amazing experience to stay in this place.....ever so busy with throngs of people....yet no room for lacunae in service..irrespective of who and what you may be in the midst of celebrities,too!!  Stayed in a number of Taj properties....but an unique experience ..the stay here! I could sense positive energy in every nook and corner....also personified in and by the service and great hospitality.  I was gifting my hubby a stay...his dream...met by the kindest Gesture of DM Isha to upgrade us to the heritage wing....loved the corridors....loved the room and the deco esp for the birthday and the view,too.  Cleanliness...perfect!!!My lil notes to housekeeping were well attended to...for extra hangers and bath mats.  Restaurants will be reviewed independently.  Ofcos location is"
"Amazing luxurious  grand place for short business/leisure stay. The service is outstanding, sometimes over the top, but where else you will get treated like a princess. The pool area, the breakfast in the tower and the views are spectacular. I will definitely will return back."
"The most amazing hotel I have EVER stayed in. The service is second to none; our suite was spotless, incredibly comfortable and the fresh roses everyday made it all prefect. The hotel is stunning and there's SO much available. It's also very conveniently placed - right outside is the Gateway of India, along with plenty of bars and restaurants within easy walking distance. A hidden gem of a bar is Colaba, a great bar right behind the hotel.  We enjoyed an excellent tour from one of the hotel's drivers. Chauhan gave us a 5 hour tour of Mumbai, stopping regularly to allow us to take photos and explain what we were looking at. He took us on a tour of markets (so I could buy some spices), gardens, important venues, tourist spots and he also recommended some excellent restaurants. I"
"This hotel should be on everyone's bucket list. We only had two nights here but were unexpectedly upgraded to one of the top luxury suites. Our pick up from the airport at midnight was seamless and our taj driver gave us a very good rundown of all the places we passed on the way to the hotel. The suite was on the top floor of the palace wing and gave us a gorgeous view of India gate. The suite itself was massive with an enormous living/ dining room, gigantic bedroom and very large bathroom. There were lovely snacks and a complimentary bottle of red wine waiting for us. There was a large minibar and complimentary tea and coffee making facilities. The shower was digital and not very easy to use. Everything was immaculate and extremely comfortable. We made the most of the"
"Spent the weekend at this hotel. It was an absolutely amazing time. The Taj Palace is a beautiful place with the highest standards of quality and service. You can choose to spend all your time inside the hotel, or step outside to the Gateway. There are many-many things to do here, from some of the best restaurants to great shopping as well. The hotel by itself has a great history - there was a documentary running in the hotel room TVs which described the history of the hotel - we actually watched the entire thing! Just walking around inside the hotel you get to see the most beautiful things - the central staircase is magnificent, the art pieces which are everywhere are great to look at. It is an expensive place to stay at, but well worth the experience."
All of the personnel at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel were of an excellent standard of service. I was very much treated like a VIP. The palace rooms are very very comfortable and you have access to afternoon tea and even a butler.
"Buffet of sandwiches, Indian foods, desserts, plus tea and coffee served at the table with stack of additional small sandwiches and desserts.  Beautiful view of harbor and India gate. Hotel has a lovely shopping arcade.  About 10 minutes and Rs.30-Rs.40 from the Oberoi by cab."
I took family for a tea in second floor of this fantastic hotel. The staff is great even if we came with rucksacks and looked very much like a tourist family. The tea launche have live piano music and tea at 8 usd/person is really cheap! They also have fantastic cakes. You will never regret visiting Worlds most fantastic hotel (this beats Dubai and Las Vegas hotels 10 times!!). Take also time to have a look at the fantastic yard pool area. 
"Wonderful service. Great staff . Very suitable for business trip , excellent business facilities .Will return again. very central location and near airport. Love the sense of heritage and character in this hotel combined with every modern requirement. Highly recommended."
"From the moment you arrive and are welcomed with a garland and dot on the forehead , you are treated like royalty. The staff are all trained to attend to your every whim and they do this with a smile. as you walk up the grand staircase , you have an inkling that the upper floors are just as grand. The butler service for palace guests ensures their comfort - like a foot soak in rose petal water after a hard day of shopping. ( hard to beat)"
"We stayed in this beautiful hotel, in the palace rooms, for 6 nights. Every detail of the hotel was perfect from the beautiful architecture to the friendly staff who made us feel so welcome.  The whole hotel including our room had a luxurious feel about it. The facilities were excellent, shops, restaurants, spa, bars and an amazing pool area. Definitely a very special place to stay."
"Stayed in the old part of the hotel  for 2 nights in March. A lovely welcome by all the staff are very welcoming and helpful. Our room was lovely we had 2 bathrooms, a small sitting room and a large bedroom with twin beds overlooking the Gateway of India. We also had a small dressing with storage for our cases room.  The facilities in the hotel were good everywhere was well maintained and the service was very good. The security was good we were on the 3rd floor the housekeeping was exceptional and we were well looked after. The pool area was a little cramped as it was quite busy over the easter week end. We ventured out of the hotel on a guided tour and we also walked around some of the side streets to see the local shops and purchased some presents."
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is one of the classic beauties amongst the hotels worldwide. The history of the hotel, the classic architecture, the proximity to the Gate of India, the phantastic pool and poolside terrace. .. For us the few days we stayed there were a dream vacation."
We visited The Taj Mahal Palace for one night. Our staying was perfect. Never had such good service. We ate in the poolside restaurant and the food and service was great. Location is great. We enjoyed so much in this wonderful hotel
"Amazing from A to Z. The staff, location, service, restaurants... All perfect. In the midst of the busy city yet an oasis. Such a treat. Takes you back in time. Family friendly as well. The swimming pool area makes a good break after the hustle and bustle of the city. "
Though Gisha warm and upgrade at the desk I have to explain why this year I have lowered my rate!Reservation on line costed me a fortune with a hardly english speaking guy though all my details you have and that I am a Taj Inner Circle member.The girls at the Old Palace were incompetent they lost my shopping and as I was in a meeting when I wanted to borrow a pen she said to me very rudly that I had to go to business center!!! We had to ask several time to have table cleaned and ashtrays emptied by the smoking section by the pool. Room of course was splendid and as I got sick the manager spoiled me with recovering gifts and wishes!It remains my favorite hôtel in Bombay!I will be back .  
A must go for the classic high tea. This is Bombay at its most classic. A great respite away from the hectic streets and place to watch Holi from.   The property take you back to another time and the service is impeccable. A must see before you leave Bombay..
"Had a beautiful stay last october, had Princess accomodation with lovely view to the indian  occean..Had a nice dinner here as is expected from a hotel of this caliber, i didnt go wow with the cuisine though it was fairly tasty ..did enjoy my tasty indian cuisine though more than the dinner. Breakfast was a good spread again as is expected from a hotel of this caliber. Did enjoy the wonderful spa. The evening tour of the hotel is pretty  informative of even the history of this hotel. The pleasant bubly tour hostess Sandra by name did make us feel welcome and at home. A few of us had questions that were promptly answered by her.Thank you Sandra!  Hope i can be back again at this wonderful hotel in tje near future."
"We Stayed TWO nights in the hotel, it was dream come true experience. We booked in Palace wing and our room was in 3rd floor. From the moment we stepped into the reception we were taken care very well. We have been taken to Palace reception and check in was smooth. Room was very nice we had sea view with Gate of India view. Definitely we are looking for comeback either this hotel or any of the Taj group hotel."
"I cannot exaggerate the quality and level of service at this hotel, where they make every effort, and beyond, with little treats, to indulge you. I love its position-as you walk out of the hotel you are straight into India with its shops, restaurants, museums, galleries, right in the heart of Mumbai. We were upgraded to a huge suite and all that went with it-flowers, fruit, wine, bookmarks, rose petals-also the owner of the company is an art collector, so every room has original artworks and paintings. Two gripes-although room rates are reasonable by european standards, the speciality restaurants are London prices, and in this connected age, a hotel of this class should not be charging extra for fast wifi-the standard free wifi is notoriously slow. And I don't know if it's by"
"I just loved this place! The history, the architecture, the colonialism, the luxury, the views, the class, the style and the service! Well appointed rooms, great marble bathrooms and the most comfortable beds! All the luxury brand name shops, 100m from the Gateway of India, smack bang in the middle of where you want to be when visiting Mumbai."
"You cannot ask for a better Hotel and out standing service.  Will always stay that the Taj Palace. No where else to stay in Mumbai.  The location of the hotel is close to great restaurants in case you want to eat out, easy to get taxis outside front gate and of course a beautiful view of the gateway of India both from our room and for walking."
I have been to the Taj Mahal Mumbai several times and it really is my favourite hotel in the world; the old wing is essential and the pool is brilliant.  I guess a few more sunbeds wouldn't go amiss but other than that I can't fault it.
If there is one hotel which is world famous from india then it has to be Hotel The Taj Mahal. The dream of J R D tata. And the first luxury 5 star hotel of india. Absolutely stunning. Their evening high tea is worth visiting. 
"Breathtaking. Inspiring. Beautiful. Just 3 of a thousand words to describe this incredible structure. I won't go on about the Taj Mahal itself as I think we all know how good it is. What I will advise on is the best way to see a number of attractions while in Agra including the Taj Mahal. First... If you are catching a train from Delhi or wherever be prepared for the attack of the taxi drivers. What I found works best is to not take the first offer/ driver. Walk around like you know what you are doing. Secondly, only purchase a ticket from the Government taxi booth. What I did was purchase a $600 rupee 8 hour tuk tuk. This will give you access only to the Agra Fort and Taj Mahal. Bit I also wanted to see the Qutab Minar which is about 45 km outside of Agra. The tuk tuk drivers"
"The hotel, and above all the rooms need to be renovated.  All appears dated.  The hotel appears to bank on its location and traditional name.  The rooms are not remotely the standard of modern hotels and sleeping is only possible with ear plugs due to the bad condition of the windows and the lack of insulation.  Street noise all night long..."
"Lovely experience from check in to check out.  Food fab tried the Moroccan on the top floor. Staff wonderful, location brilliant.  History of the hotel fascinating.  Felt like royalty in our upgraded room.  Breakfast was lovely overlooking the sea or by the swimming pool. A world away from the Mumbai madness."
"This was the best stay in my life. Cherry on top of the India cake. Great history and authenticity. Services are flawless.  Consider having breakfast in tower, with great & rare panoramic views of Mumbay and Indian Gateway.  Reserve some time to spend at the pool and spa."
I had high expectations for my stay and they were all exceeded - an exceptional experience and stay.  One of the finest hotels in the world.  The staff went out their way to ensure that we enjoyed every aspect of our stay.
"Overall stay was good, except the noise levels from neighboring room which was beyond tolerable limits. Enjoyed lunch at ""Masala"" restaurant. Location is perfect, room had beautiful view. Service was also good and prompt."
"We stayed in this hotel for two days at the end of our two week Golden Triangle visit. We were looking forward to the visit and it lived up to all our expectations. We were well looked after in every respect from arrival to departure. The customer service was excellent. The hotel is so large that it took us quite a while to explore it, but we particularly enjoyed the orientation tour that the staff put on daily for those visitors who are interested in the history of the building.There are several restaurants to choose from, catering for all tastes, from Indian to Oriental, to continental. We ate in sumptuous style in the area just to the rear of the pool on our first evening, just outside the original reception area of the hotel, when the entrance faced the city. The food was"
"The hotel itself is a must visit place in mumbai; it has a beautiful swimming pool and great view of the gate of india and the city.   There are three places for breakfast; try to have it @ sea lounge.  But, its service!!! It needs so much improvement. One, it's short-staffed. Two, they are under trained. Three, they are not really welcoming.  The location is perfect, though.   "
"We only stayed here for one night on our transit to Goa, we arrived late @ 9pm check in was very efficient. We were upgraded to one of the Palace rooms, very nice room with a view overlooking The Gate of India. We ate in Souk, it was ok but nothing special. The next morning we had breakfast sat outside by the swimming pool. We spent a total of 16 days touring India and one of the lasting memories of the trip was having breakfast  outside at The Taj. We will be back."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is one of the hotels in the world where I have always wanted to stay. And I am so glad that I decided to splurge and stay there one night. It’s just beautiful. But even the lowest rate is still a hefty price.   The room was clean, comfortable, a nice size, and decorated nicely with colonial wood and upholstered furniture in beautiful colors. The bathroom was a standard size, full of the usual amenities.   The very ample breakfast buffet had a nice selection of Indian, western, and some Asian items, including fresh fruit, made-to-order eggs, Indian specialties, and a nice variety of pastries too.   The hotel’s location is right next to the Gateway to India, so in that respect it is ideal. However, what I found out is that Mumbai is a huge city and there is"
Almost thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the taj palace. Service is excellent and hotel of a high standard.   Unhappy with the smell in my room coming from the air conditioner. Complains four days and lived in the unbearable smell until they bought a scented dehumidifier which masked the smell whilst on but unusable at night as its noisy.   Final bill also has laundry costs and minibar costs that I didn't use 
"I have stayed here a few times and love the place but this time there were a few fumbles. In particular the manager at the Shamiana where we went for breakfast, had this odd snooty expression on his face... Tall chap. We had to ask for coffee to be served, which he did with an expression and attitude of doing a favour. This was on 26th morning. So we moved to the Sea Lounge for breakfast on 27th morning and were really glad we did. Ershad did everything he could to make us comfortable and went the extra mile. Even though he did not succeed in getting some appropriate foodstuff for my aunt who was fasting... Sopan (housekeeping Tower Wing) and wonderful Anselm at The Souk were really great and kept up the reputation of the Taj for great staff and great service, going out of their"
"It is third time for me to India, but first time to Mumbai. This city is very beautiful and all peoople are friendly. I feel extremly comfortable at your hotel. All colleagues from your hotel are full of smile and kind. It is a happy journey for me. Thanks for your hospitality. Wish your hotel a better future and business."
Myself and partner went in a bit apprehensive. I was expecting the staff to be pompous but they were so welcoming we ended up having lunch there. The restaurant staff were so attentive and welcoming. The food was delicious and well presented. Lovely experience of hotel and especially the restaurant.  Well done to all staff.
"This hotel is an icon in so many ways: because of its place in India social history (being built because a very rich Indian was denied access to the now almost derelict Watson’s Hotel); because its statement building dominates the former arrival and departure point by the Gateway of India; and in recent history, after the 2008 attacks, to let those who wish show to terrorists that we will not change our lives because of their warped views.  In effect it is two hotels in one, because of the distinction between the Palace and Tower Wings, even with separate check-in facilities.  I was staying in the Palace Wing, which is extremely impressive, to the extent that one has to leave one’s room in the morning and pause at the central staircase to absorb - once again - how impressive it"
"Highly recommend The Taj Palace Hotel in Mumbai, great service, lovely staff, exceptionally clean. Each evening I came back to the room to find a small gift, a little box or bangles and flowers on the floor! First day we were by the pool we had a towel and water bottle put out for us to enjoy the sunshine.  The hotel organised a city tour which was great. Definitely would stay there again"
"This hotel faces the Gateway of India and is a beautiful place. My family and I went for lunch here during our tour of Mumbai. Originally we were only going to have a coffee and some cake but the welcome we request was lovely. The staff were so attentive and good at suggesting which of their restaurants and cafes to go to. Once we saw the menu we ended up having lunch. It was delicious and exceeded our expectations in every way. The service was brilliant, calm atmosphere, very clean and you could tell that there were very high standards. I would love to come again and actually stay here!!"
"This is an excellent hotel situated in a central location for access to most sights of Mumbai and in particular the India Gate. The service is excellent and my thanks to 2 of the room attendants namely Vishank and Ajit who made our stay very comfortable. Security is stringent to make one feel very comfortable. Nevertheless, beware if the following which we experienced: 1. when booking make sure that you find out which building you are to be in. The Tower or the Palace. The latter is the historic building while the former is an international modern multistorey hotel. Obviously the Tower accommodation is cheaper but of international prices and standards. 2. when booking a tour via the hotel do not charge it to the room as they will impose a fee without telling you.  3. if you are"
everything about the hotel is awesome be it breakfast or gala dinner  and services are very well managed  hotel staff is also very kind and helpfull  itsa agrat palce for family or business meetings  hope to visit again
Me-my wife and our 1 year old daughter checked-in to Taj Mahal Palace Hotel facing gateway of India. Had a decent welcome and check in process was quick and smooth. Needless to say-things that followed are outstanding service and hospitality by team Taj. We were given a room facing sea -18th floor to be pricese. Excellent view and guys you have earned a loyal Taj Guest who will swear by your hospitality. You have not just delighted me but my wife and my daughter with your pleasant surprises. Overall well trained crew and excellent service makes it a must stay in Mumbai. Good Location //
"Included in our Intrepid India tour was High Tea at the Taj Palace, a very beautiful old Indian hotel, once subject to and damaged by an attach from an Islamic militant organization and has been restored to its previous splendor. The food as well as the service was first class and enjoyed over an extended afternoon. If in Mumbai and you have the time its well worth a visit."
"Three years ago when I asked a good friend who travels to India every year, where I should stay in Mumbai, he told me that there was only one hotel to consider. This was my third time in the Taj Mahal Palace and once again from the moment I stepped out of the taxi  it was like being in a fairytale. We were treated like VIP's despite our luggage being nylon holdalls filled with Goan treasures! . We were delighted to be given an upgrade to a club room in the Palace Wing where  we were looked after by Husain, who took care of our us and our room in the most professional  and caring way. Small gifts for women's day, beautifully arranged room with rose petals and all our mess tidied away every time we returned. Wow! If you can afford the Palace Wing its a real treat but if not the"
"Staying in the Heritage Wing of this hotel is always great.  It is now more of a tourist destination than a business hotel, but that does not diminish the experience.  Excellent and well maintained pool, good choice of restaurants, but most of all dedicated staff with the highest standards of service.  Nothing is too much trouble."
The elegant and unique building can only be found in Mumbai the Taj Mahal Palace. Not only the attractive fragrant colourful flowers were displayed everywhere but also the attentive smiling staff were ready to help in every corner of the hotel ( a perfect combination). 
"ThIs is a beautiful hotel but its bathrooms and hallways need a lot of work.   On the other hand, the staff was really great. People in every single department went out of their way to offer advice and help. The housekeeping and room service were excellent. And the in-house restaurants were exceptional. "
Wonderful architecture and great service lead you to easily imagine that you have skipped back in time to the art deco period and all that went with it. This is truly one of the best hotels I have stayed in over the years and I am always pleased to go back  I recently reviewed the hotel and it incorrectly loaded as one star- I have asked Tripadvisor to adjust it
hey guys I would surely recommend this restro to all of the foodies and all other people and I would like to say that overall its great service and great food quality great food decoration and last but not the least its food taste is fantabulous!!!!! go there and u will surely like the food especially non veg foodies   I hope my review help all of you   thanks
"A great property, royal rooms in pure white marble and ethnic designs with the sombre ambience, make the Taj such a joy to be at.   The breakfast spread is however very basic and is not very elaborate, but the taste is surely very good.  U get transported to another world as compared to the chaos outside."
"for many years,staying at the taj mahal hotel at the gateway of india was on my wish list....i had heard about their legendary hospitality and finally decided to stay overnight at the hotel simply for the experience of it all...and we reserved a room facing the sea for which we paid an hefty extra charge. when we reached the hotel,we were informed that we had been upgraded to the heritage wing of the hotel and we were thrilled to the core and couldn't wait for the experience to begin. we were taken to our room and what a SHOCK awaited us there....and i could not believe i was paying nearly twenty thousand INR for this.....the room was a medium size room cluttered with furniture....and the prized windows with a view were a joke...small...and for the view..you had to go up to the"
"Excellent Hotel facilities and most helpful staff.  The Room, Shower and Breakfast were a delight.  My morning swim in such a peaceful setting invigorated me for the day ahead.  Souk restaurant was a pleasure to eat in with such wonderful views."
This is being India's one of the most beautiful and best hotel in all aspects. This hotel defines the proper meaning of hospitality and due to presence in one of the most beautiful location the view are unbeatable. However one this about this hotel which attracts me the most is history behind its existence.  Good Luck..!!!
"Their excellent service made me feel very comfortable, pampered and satisfied. Their special attention and occasionally special treatments made me feel so good. Small acts.like providing basin of rose.petals and herb foot bath is such a welcome pleasure. Thank you.for the delightful stay. Lum chooi seen"
"Great hotel and one of the best in the world. A memorable life long experience. Top location, staff extremely attentive and the service is excellent. Staying with a large family can be costly as the add on luxury and government taxes can inflate the total price. However, if in India and especially in Mumbai you have to stay in this hotel  - at least for one night !"
Arrived at the Taj early evening after a long day travelling completely worn. On entry were instantly refreshed by the warmth of welcome. Even more surprised to discover we had been given a complimentary upgrade from the Taj towers to the palace and not only that the room in the palace was sea facing. Everything about this hotel screams 5 stars plus. Restaurants to suit everyone serving excellent food.  Many thanks to everyone at the Taj
"I have just recently returned from a two night stay at the Taj palace hotel,it was everything I hoped it would be and more,so where to start. On arriving at the airport we where met by a very smart and polite driver taken to the hotel where we were greeted by the lobby manager and taken to the palace lounge,given a drink and two receptionist came and took our passports and booked us in( no queuing at reception)  they then returned and escorted us to our rooms,we had been given  an upgrade to the most beautiful  suites with amazing views. My brothers in law had informed them that we were celebrating my 60 th birthday and they definitely went the extra mile to make it a fabulous experience,Ist night I returned to my room there was a birthday cake 2nd night my bedroom was filled"
"I dont know where to start or how to put into words our experience at Taj, the only thing i can suggest is if are thinking of going - DO IT. from the pick up at airport to the drop off it was like we were on a cloud, the staff were fantastic and the hotel itself is a monument to luxary."
"What more can we say on this mythical institution!!! The most beautiful hotel of India is widely up to his reputation. Everything is there!!! The beauty of the building, the peace and green setting at the heart of the bouillonnante city, the welcome, the services and the Seafood restaurant at the edge of the wonderful swimming pool... During 4 days, we were cherished, spoiled, listened to as if we were princesses following the example of stars' numerous photos which went that way. SPECIAL GRADE : To our 2 servers Mohsin and Ashish and to our wonderful and talented Chef Shrinivas to the restaurant Seafood."
I stayed for a night at Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai and i can tell you it is the best place to get spoiled. The staff was warm and gave a grand welcome to us (when they came to know that we were on our honeymoon) and took an extra step to make our stay amazing.
This is my second stay at this hotel. I stayed here with my family. It was really a memorable stay for all of us. The rooms are excellent & great choice of restaurants. The staffs here are so willing to help. I must appreciate the house keeping staffs for their exemplary work. Our stay was filled with pleasant surprises.   I highly recommend this hotel.
We stayed for business for 10 days. Well worth it. The staff are amazing and friendly and helpful. The hotel is clean. The rooms are a little dated but very comfortable. The food is delicious although i feel overpriced.  There are good restaurants around the hotel and a very new starbucks on the same premises with excellent coffee This hotel is well worth the stay
"This is held in the Sea View Lounge which overlooks the bay and the Gate of India.  High Tea is 150,000 rps/head and champers an extra 150,000/glass ++. So be careful. The building is stuck firmly in a time warp of the colonial period. Opulence is an understatement. Food is OK but ambience is ""off the scale"".  So its up to you. Slum it or not!  BUT its good if your low on brownie points with your other half!!!"
"Our first stay, 4 nights, at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai. Elegance, extreme courtesy and efficiency of the staff, beauty of the common spaces, particularly the patio and its marvelous swimming-pool, delightful breakfast, large choice of restaurants (we tried two), quiet and very agreeable room. This hotel was our oasis in vibrant but tiring Mumbai.  We are experienced travelers, used to first class places. This hotel is by far our best ever. We already miss it. We have planned to come back for ten days in some time...."
"The only thing I would advise is not to take an 'upgrade' unless you don't care about the view.  We had booked a harbor view room but were told we had been upgraded and accepted that, but it was a pool view..  I wish they hadn't done that as we wanted to see the harbor."
A group of us went to afternoon tea and had a wonderful afternoon.  Lovely ambience and far to much food which we all enjoyed immensely.  The staff were very helpful and attentive.  Afterwards we wandered around the hotel and enjoyed the quiet elegance.  I would love to stay there at some point.
"The best experience ever. What a place, the service, the food and the whole nine yard was the best. We have stayed at some the better hotels around the world; this was by far the best experience yet. Thanks Taj Place."
"The best heritage hotel i have been so far in Mumbai. The staff is very kind, cooperative and helpful  to each and every guest. Rooms are very beautiful with high end facilities, Anytime you visit Mumbai visit this hotel just for a lunch, dinner or snacks at Sea lounge if you cannot stay. Ms Isha at reception and Ms Tanvi Dandekar as a duty manager was very helpful to me. The food at shamiyana Restuarent was so delicious. Thank you very much for such a good and high end service always provided by you."
"We stayed three nights in the Palace - a luxury grand seaview room. The hotel architecture and style is true to the colonial era and to that extent a stay here is a worthwhile experience. Our room looked out over the (brown) water and had the Gates of India to our left view. The hotel is noisy, crowded and busy as you should expect in an Indian city. Security is pretty tight now and that is a comfort. Our room was of adequate size, furnished tastefully and a comfy bed which has a pillow menu. Our room was serviced perfectly by a gentleman who topped the room off each day by doing a pattern/design on the floor with  petals from flowers in front of our full length mirror - it was beautifully done and changed each day. It was unique and in 18 days in India never repeated at any"
The Taj Mahal palace is amazing place. Very goo hotel. Services are very good and facility are good. Expensive hotel but worth. Near of beach. Very good street near taj hotel. Rooms are very good. Taxi service also available. Food also good.
"People love or hate this place. It is an over populated people pilgrimage. We stay in the club rooms which are pretty and quirky.  In terms of modern city hotels you cannot say they are the most spacious - they are old and re-furbished but that does not detract from the stay.  When we arrived our room did not feel complete - well rather un-pampered. But after a complaint to the duty Manager. The most amazing flowers, special crystal and salts for the bath, chocolates and a whole of very special treats arrived each night. They certainly know how to do it if they want. Just a little reminder goes a long way. Breakfast used to be around the pool and they changed that to upstairs. The views by the window are spectacular but not as relaxing. The club room for snacks and drinks at"
Flawless experience from Check in to Checkout.It's rare to have no criticisms but this is one of the few places. Having worked and lived in India 20 years ago my expectations were limited but the Taj exceeded at every turn. We wanted to get a real snapshot of South Mumbai in 3 days and staying at the Taj achieved exactly that. Security is tight and rightly so but by no means intrusive - certain major airports around the world could take a lesson from what courteous but thorough security means. The Taj has been around for over 100 years. You can see why.
I had visited taj mahal hotel mumbai with my family for the last weekend to celebrate my elder son's birthday. I can just say one thing fantabulous.  This was probably one of the best birthdays celebrated for my son by us. A ton of thanks to Mr Taronish Karkaria and Mr Arzaan Billimoria for making our day so special. It was indeed one of the best time spent by all of us together.  Looking forward to for our  next visit. 
Amazingly beautiful hotel with attentive staff.  Comprehensive and tasty breakfast. A great location in south Mumbai within walking distance of things to do. Glad we decided on the Taj rather than other chain hotels as it has that something extra.
"I wasn't staying at the Taj Mahal Palace; we went to have a coffee and take look around. We were shown into a stuffy, deserted restaurant and told we couldn't have a coffee outside as that area was for guests only. We stayed unfortunately. We knew it would be expensive, though 956 rupees for an espresso and a breakfast tea is extraordinary (nearly £10 - feed 3 of us for dinner and drinks in most other establishments). I was unimpressed that the government taxes are added to the prices, and that information is in truly tiny print at the bottom of the menu - everywhere else I have been in India either includes the taxes, or makes it clear they are to be added. But more damning is that the espresso was the worst I have had here. There are many far better within 5 minutes' walk."
What a brilliant hotel. It was such an experience to enjoy the heritage and glamour of the colonial era. The palace club rooms are amazing and we even got upgraded to a suite! we enjoyed the pool area and spent most of our time enjoying the drinks and snacks in the club palace. If you can afford it then the Palace club is a must...
Ive travelled the world and this must be the best most luxurious stay ever. The staff and service is just too good. They care about every single guest. The rooms and beds are perfect I loved coming home after a long day to find my bath filled with water and beautiful rose petals  Just very very special The pool is to die for All in all 2 nights of pure decadence lovely!
"From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel relaxed and at home. We wanted for nothing while staying here. One thing that came in handy was the in house doctor. The business centre and concierge helped with urgent business matters and always gave 110% to the task. The rooms had fantastic views over the bay and Gateway to India."
"We stayed at the 'The Taj Mahal Palace' for three nights - simply the best hotel we've ever stayed in - bar none. This place is a perfect oasis in the middle of a crazy city.   The hotel has absolutely everything down to a fine art. The staff are extremely helpful, the food at the multiple restaurants is some of the best we've ever eaten, and our room was beautifully appointed with all the modern features in a stunning 100 year old building. Also the Taj is centrally located to all the major attractions in Mumbai, everyone knows where the Taj is!  We look forward to staying there again in the future!"
Stayed here for 3 nights on business in February.  The rooms are spacious and very clean and modern.  Classy hotel with fantastic service.  You are right across the street from the Gateway to India.  Restaurants in the hotel is first class!
"Loved staying at this landmark hotel. It was an exceptional experience. It is such a busy place yet personal attention is a priority. I had a question about turn down service, not a complaint, but a question. Each night, thereafter, a special treat awaited me when I returned to my room. How thoughtful. I loved the location as well. Great area to walk around, yet  appreciated the calm (and heritage tour) after walking around."
"The hotel is situated in one of the best locations, staying in Palace room is getting connected with the pre-independence era. The palace room is like providing glimpse of traditional old era equipped with most modern facilities. The staff and the management team are very supportive and are there to render any help required. Overall experience of my four night stay was extremely  satisfying."
"this is the Grande Dame of Mumbai hotels and well deserves the accolade. the hotel has two halves - the old and the new. I stayed in the new section, which is of a standard equivalent to a decent 4 * in Europe but the grounds and facilities of the old part are very welcoming and relaxing and engender a sense of the old Raj. there is also a fabulous cocktail bar whichever part you stay in ask for a room with a sea view; mine had a spectacular view over the India gate and the sea beyond to the west."
What an amazing hotel. Very grand in style but still has a superb personal touch! Service is beyond expectation. Had my lunch at shamiana restaurant..  I was amazed by the food choices and the taste was fantastic. Worth to be there.  Wah Taj wah!!! 
I along with my family stayed at Taj palace for 2 days and one night.  The rooms are tastefully made and the service is impeccable   Heritage walk is generally a part of the package and completely worth it.  The restaurants serve multi cuisine food and there's something for everyone in the buffet.  There are 5 stars.. There are 7 stars and then...there is taj palace.  Completely worth the cost and a must once in a lifetime
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel after seeing a BBC documentary series about the hotel. We were so impressed by the programme, we felt we had to see the hotel ourselves. We were not disappointed! Every aspect of comfort and convenience is catered for. The staff cannot do enough for you and the service, food, and rooms are excellent. We stayed in a ""Taj Club' room in the Palace with a view directly over the Gateway of India. Truly spectacular! The pool area was lovely and to spend an afternoon swimming and relaxing was exactly what we needed after 6 weeks of back-packing in India. Thank you to the manager and everyone at the hotel and we'd certainly recommend it to anyone and maybe, hopefully, we will return one day."
"I with my four friends visited the palace few months back, the Palace is just wow! Food was awesome and delicious, wonderful infrastructure and interiors. Rooms were huge and clean, enjoyed a lot staying there. The request that we made was done in quick time, i was really impressed by that. Bed was comfortable to sleep on, staffs were friendly and helpful. The Taj Mahal Palace is really a Palace. I will surly visit again with my family very soon."
The hotel ended up charging me for the two rooms I booked almost twice the price of what I got on Booking.com. This issue must be checked and customers must be informed not at the point of check out. The Taj Mahal Mumbai should inform customers upon arrival the total cost of what they booked on online booking portal (Booking.com) not to opt out for separate charges.
"Amazing hotel, great staff, delicious food!  We have stayed at various 5 star hotels around the world but this hotel is par excellence! We can't wait to come back!! We would highly recommend it to our family and friends."
"Our stay at the Taj was really prefect in every way, from the moment we were picked up at the airport to the moment we were dropped off again. The staff members are professional, kind, efficient and attentive to your every need. Needless to say that the place is being kept immaculate, deserving its grand heritage.   Breakfast was a sheer delight. Excellent quality of food, with attentive staff who seem to know what you wish for before you even know if yourself.  Overall, it was the best hotel experience we've had!  If you have the time, take the freely offered tour of the hotel. It lasts about an hour and allows you to explore various parts of this vast property, you might even not realise existed."
"I've stayed at luxury hotels around the globe and I have to say, the service at the Taj was the best I've ever received. Everyone, literally everyone, was fantastic. From Jaspreet doing an excellent job during check in to Dinesh who was fantastic assisting me in exploring the city, top to bottom the staff was amazing. Usually when I say the staff exceeded my expectations I'm referring to 1 or 2 people who went out of their way to help me, but I can honestly say it was every single person at your hotel. Additionally, I have a very, very young looking face and often I feel like people's standards decrease when I interact with them but that certainly was not the case here. We actually cancelled our hotel in Jaipur and rebooked with the Taj as a result. The view from the room was"
"My wife and I stayed here for two nights on our way to Aurangabad. In addition to the nice location of the hotel, the service by the staff was excellent. Only problem we experienced was an extremely tight security that is done to everyone going into the hotel, although I understand it in the end protect us staying there."
Stayed at the palace with my wife. This hotel is beyond luxurious. The staff is extremly courteous and every single person seems to know who you are even though you havent met them before. Stayed in the corner suite. The room was exceptional. We were eligible for the cocktail hour and the cognac tasting which takes place on the ground floor and is exclusively for guests. I am sure i will be back here very soon.
"There are two sections to this incredible landmark. You choose your own preference. Modern or not. For me it was the charm of the original section that gave me great pleasure every moment spent at the Taj Mahal Palace in ""Bombay"". The service was unsurpassed, attention to detail from arrival to departure. Thoughtful, unexpected gifts always a delight on returning to the room after a long day exploring. Plenty of bottled water on hand. wonderful amenities including a gym with personal yoga instructors on request. Breakfast fit for royalty with warm, and efficient staff quietly seeing to your every whim. A memorable and utterly satisfying experience."
"Mumbai is a noisy city, Mumbai is in some places a dirty city - once you step in this hotel you will forget all these things. Book a room in the Old Wing (rooms are awesome)  and relax at the Poolside, have lunch near the pool and enjoy the wonderful surrounding, the excellent service and the excellent food. If you are in Tower Wing enjoy the exceptional views to the harbour. and the Gateway of India."
"Stayed here for 1 night before I flew back home! It was absolutely amazing, completely loved it and I will be back! :)   Only thing is that the bathroom had a shower curtain which doesn't suit a hotel like this, there are renovations occurring so I hope they will be upgrading the bathrooms!  Otherwise its AMAZING!!! :)"
"you really feel the history of India. the hotel itself gives you a sense of indian: its location across the Gateway of India overlooking Bombay bay, its elegance and almost majestic feel about it is truly magnificent. it is perfect for holidays and i wish i stayed longer."
"We have been visiting this hotel now for 13 years. In fact my family and I lived there for 3 months in 2004! Nothing to say but ... that this place in an institution. The history, the bars, the staff (who go so far out of their way to make you feel special), the rooms (Heritage Wing!) are all the best. Its not a plush 2016 new build but it is all you want or need or, in fact what you should expect ... from Bombay. It has this family's best hotel rating and we go back, me for business and the family for pleasure at least every 3 months ... visit Ravi in Continental Jewelers, Ground floor Tower Wing ... and mention our name - he is a gem :-) ..."
Lives up to expectation. Excellent location specially to first time visitors to Mumbai and /or India. The Pool is a great option specially in the summer time. Maybe the invite to the heritage tour should be extended to all the guests ( not only those staying in the heritage wing).
"The Taj Mahal Palace is an oasis of calm with fabulous amenities, grand surroundings and very high levels of service across the board. Steeped in history you will not forget a stay at this hotel. Diverse range of rooms and restaurants will cater to all tastes."
"the best Property in Bombay ! yeh hain mumbai meri jaannn , Excellent food , rooms ! shall visit again . Its close by to many food joints in south mumbai + the night life ! rates are little high but worth paying for the amount"
"Great stay in the best class of property, Truly amazing of 112 years old crystal clear cleanliness property. The entire staff had smiling face and always extended for service. Best location, within walking distance of all tourist spots."
"There are two worlds: the taj tower and the taj palace. Yes, they are within the same hotel, but worlds apart. We were first accommodated in the taj tower - your average 5 star hotel. However, as we walked through the hotel we quickly came to realize that the hotel's fame stems for the palace. Thus we decided to pay for an upgrade and received a room in the palace. Everything there is outstanding: The rooms are spacious and are kept to the highest standards and the staff is competent and friendly. This has been one of the most enjoyable stays and is worth every penny. You feel as if you're living the history.  I can only recommend this hotel."
"You are in for a real treat if you stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai. Our travel agent had booked us into the Tower with a city view for 2 nights; we were upgraded to the Palace on the top floor with a view of India Gate and the sea. We also had access to the Palace Lounge where we could have free tea or coffee all day, afternoon tea, cocktails and an evening buffet."
"Stay at Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai was good and successful. Front office staff, House Keeping and Restaurant staff are courteous and helpful.. They are ready to help and try to keep the guest happy. Staff is well trained and know their job well and go extra mile."
Its at its best ...Taj Mahal Palace .... Booked room in Tower but they upgraded it to Taj Mahal Palace. Its dream cum true for me. Just Enjoyed my stay with my family. It was our anniversary. Very nice ambiance  & they made my day. Thanks to TATA's.
"The Taj Palace Hotel Isi exactly what it says on the tin. It's a hotel to experience. The staff deliver service with attention to detail and precision like never experienced. Every aspect of the hotel is outstanding. Visit Niteah in the main resteraunts. His attention to service is the finest experienced. The numerous resteraunts and bars are unique and the food is great. Try afternoon tea at the sea lounge overlooking the Arabian Sea and the gateway to India. I wished I had taken the offer of help  from the butler to iron my dress, at least he'd have done a better job! Concierge service exemplary and sorted out my flight confirmation etc. If you visit Mumbai, be sure to visit the Taj Palace. It screams Indian tradition of making a guest feel like they are family."
"Had gone for a business gathering and lunch thereafter, at the Rendezvous on the top floor of the Taj.  Superb decor and ambience, and the view stretching away on two sides was nice.  Food was not that great tasting, but otherwise a good experience."
"fabulous hotel, feels like you came visit your indian family. the hotel is very clean,excellent service, help you with whatever you like(restaurants, trips,attractions and more) the breakfast is very tasty and contains typical indian food. best location in mumbai very close to all of the area attractions. looking forward to visit you again."
The Taj is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. It oozes great style and service. I would recommend this place to anyone. The high tea in the sea lounge was a great treat and the staff were attentive and courteous at all times. Location too was great with a choice of amazing places to eat within walking distance and the gateway of India on its doorstep. 
"Really, this iconic hotel hardly needs my endorsement. We expected it to be great and it exceeded our expectations. We chose to stay in the historic palace wing and our rooms were large and well appointed. What really made it stand out for us,however, was the quality of service. It goes without saying that it was efficient but it was the warmth with which we were looked after that surprised us. We felt completely cosseted in this oasis of calm in fabulous but manic Mumbai. The icing on the cake for us was to be met on our departure from Mumbai airport by a member of staff who saw us through security and stayed with us until we had checked in. A perfect start to our Indian holiday."
Stayed for 2 nights at the end of a tour of Kerala and Goa. This is a landmark hotel and one of the places to stay in an ideal location in Mumbai. We booked a Tower room and were well located up on the 16th floor with great views of India Gate. The room was clean and recently decorated but was a bit smaller than others on the tour so you pay a premium price for the name. Buffet breakfast were very good and included a waiter service for eggs. We ate one night in the Masala Kraft Restaurant which was pricey but superb Indian cuisine. Service was excellent throughout. There was a lot of security on the entrance.
"It is tough to add to the already existing plethora of reviews of this landmark of Mumbai! Impeccable service, gorgeous views of the sea and Gateway of India, lovely breakfast at Sea Lounge, nice places to walk around....it is the old-world character of the hotel which truly stands out!"
"I spent one night at the historic Taj Mahal Palace across from the Gateway of India in South Mumbai. Very posh, a clear focus on service, maybe just a little over the top for a do-it-yourself kind of American. All systems worked great, just a little unusual in my limited India experience. Good gym and beautiful pool. Food options good to excellent, but pricey."
"A Bucket List hotel which we were so looking forward to and were not disappointed!  Beautifully appointed public areas, wonderful restaurants, lovely room overlooking the Gateway to India.  Really enjoyed dining poolside at the evening Barbeque.  Very friendly staff.  A great experience."
"The best hotel I have stayed in. The rooms are immaculate, pool is a haven in the city but most of all the staff are world class! To Illustrate, I left my camera in a taxi from the airport and was devastated, the staff moved heaven and earth to find the car and sent a private car of their own back to the airport to Collected it when they had located it.   We also ate in the Chinese restaurant one evening and were blown away, the chefs even came out of the kitchen to check everything was ok.  This is world class service and I hope I am lucky enough to visit again"
"What else to add to the Taj reputation? Well simply to repeat what is is. One of the best hotel in the world! As returned guests, we had the pleasure to be upgraded and instead of an already amazing room in the tower, we had a fantastic one in the old classic building. It will transport you to the classy experience of the old colonial times. Th service is exceptional.more than attentive. It's all beyond the call of duty. Every time you leave the room, they come and re-tidy it. New soaps, towels, water bottles, ... The cushions are put on the bed in the morning and back in the draws in the evening. There is also plenty of small details like putting a Velcro cable tie around the charging leads of our phones/electronic devices. Nothing's too much to ask. The breakfast in the sea"
"You'd have to be some pretentious spoilt rich kid to find fault with anything this hotel does. From the rooms, the welcome, the class and staff, this place sets the benchmark to which others can only aspire. It redefines luxury and service.   My wife and i travel all over the world, all the time and stay in around 40 plus hotels a year. In all those travels, nowhere has come close to offering what the Taj Mahal Palace does.   The amazing rooms, attention to the tiniest of details, great food and gorgeous pool allow guests to live like royalty, just for a while. Its a special place and a travel experience in its own right. You can stay in any number of modern luxury hotels in Mumbai, but there is only one Taj. It's unique. "
One of the best hotels i stayed in the staff is so good  excellent room and excellent location of the hotel add glamour to the stay. the location and the walk around the property make you feel that you have seen half the mumbai.
"What a beautiful hotel. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Got upgraded to a suite which was a real treat. Food in Masala Kraft was amazing and not to spicy if you took the waiters advice on what to have. Not cheap, but worth a visit. Preferred Mumbai to Delhi . A wonderful stay."
"Exceptional service, perfect downtown location next to the Gate of India, excellent food and comfortable rooms with much history, though a bit outdated.  Overall, a wonderful experience. Don't miss the happy hour at the Sea Lounge and the breakfast with lots of Indian and Western choices.  Also noteworthy, the concierge excellent service to help organize your local activities and travel."
"The best hotel experience you can get, and by european standards not expensive! A vast building, you need a map to explore it all, with a great view over the harbour & the Gateway to India monument, Good pool & relaxing area, superb & attentive staff & a breakfast to die for!  and incredibly plush & comfortable rooms.(get one with a balcony if you can) What more do you need!!"
"We usually stay at an hotel near the airport when we are in Mumbai but this time we wanted to treat ourselves to a couple of nights at this iconic hotel, And what a treat it was. We had booked a city view club room but were upgraded to a fabulous executive suite, to say we were pleased is putting it mildly.  We felt that we were treated like royalty, such is the wonderful customer service here, we were constantly amazed by the way they pre-empted our needs. The building itself is amazing and it is worth taking the Heritage Walk which is available at 5pm everyday, to learn about its history. We had breakfast at the Sea Lounge included in our package, this was excellent with plenty of choice, only downside it was very popular & you had to wait for a table. We ate dinner at"
"Stayed at the taj for three nights, got there early hours of the morning, check in was quick, booked airport transfer through hotel which was costly, the room was outstanding, extremely clean with good quality bed, bedding and towels, safe and mini bar, decorated tastefully, we were welcomed with a free juice cocktail, the housekeeper was very attentive and friendly, reception staff were ok, not overly happy in general, the hotel has a wide range of high level designer shops, the restaurant  for breakfast is good, the rooftop restaurant is excellent for taking pictures of the city, alcohol Is VERY expensive in India, hotel prices were extreme but there is a shop that sells wines at a good price, on the weekend there were a huge amount of tourists in the hotel that weren't guests"
We were very lucky because Jan is a good time to visit as it was not very busy. We went about 11 am ish so was able to take photos without lots of people in the way. We had our own guide which was all part of our paid trip from Candolim Goa. The Taj is ! Well I am lost for words as it is such an emotional sight to see. Anyone that visits India & dies not see this magnificent sight is completely missing the best.
"We had booked a tower room but when we arrived were upgraded to a palace room. A map of the hotel would have been nice as the place is huge. All the staff were pleasant and welcoming. Breakfast was a time to enjoy, both the variety and quality of the food and the views of the harbour and Gateway. It was little touches that make you appreciate how good this hotel is. I left a book in the room, when we came back the room boy had noticed I didn't have a bookmark and had left one."
"Best Hotel Experience!  Best breakfast in the world with the greatest views!  Would recommend this hotel to everyone, particularly to stay in the Historic Palace wing.  The staff was impeccable and loved every minute of out stay."
"Whatever your needs are, the Taj Mahal Palace will satisfy them. At least that is what we felt when we stayed there. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The service is impeccable. Having birthday during our stay, we were being served cake at the room in the morning and later in the afternoon. We have already concluded that Mumbai for us is equivalent to the Taj Mahal Palace. This is the hotel to stay at."
"I will run out of superlatives to describe this hotel - the rooms are fantastic, the staff polite and very helpful, particularly concierge and travel desk. We were upgraded to a room in the Palace, which is a must, and the breakfast buffet at the top of the Tower offered amazing views. Martini in the harbour bar also compulsory."
"The building, the staff, the culture, the food, drinks, atmosphere of just being in this majestic building is awesome.  Do not miss out on the guided tour of the hotel a very worthwhile 45 minutes spent and so much history.  Delightful and courteous staff, cannot possibly do enough for you.  No request is a problem, staff will go out of the way to oblige we were made to feel very very special, it was a privilege to stay here - Golden Gateway certainly stands up to its name.  Pool Area and surrounding alcoves beautiful., p.s. The Taj also has its own picture gallery - amazing."
I wonder how and where Taj staff members are trained to get right guest orientation and and make them happy just by their right approach and manners.  Excellent customer orientation in all Taj Group Hotels.
The experience of Taj is an outstanding one. From the moment you walk in to the end of stay. Everything is well taken care of. The room and the staff are outstanding. The restaurants and the breakfast is also amazing.
check in was very quick and the luggage was in my room right away. the elegance and the design is beautiful with gardens and beautiful pool and the different restaurants were all excellent. The breakfast was very lavish with extensive selection of everything. The staff was very friendly with greetings and smiles all the time. The concierge was very helpful at all hours. The best location in mumbai.
A step back in time....what a phenomenal experience. We stayed in the garden facing rooms. They were comfortable and the room service was on point. Highly recommended for anybody visiting India to stay at least one night here. Simply special
What superlatives can you add to the many heaped on this hotel in previous reviews. Suffice to say that the service from start to finish was impeccable and frankly I would find it difficult to believe this could be bettered anywhere. For our first week we booked a villa in Goa finishing off with 3 nights in The Taj Mahal Palace on our way back to the UK. On our arrival at the villa I realised that I had inadvertently left my Kindle Reader on the inbound flight from London. All my efforts to recover it from the airline drew a blank. So as a last resort I contacted the Concierge Team at the Taj and they just swung into action and cut through all the red tape.On our arrival at the hotel the concierge was waiting outside the room to present my Kindle all suitably wrapped. MARVELOUS.
"While in Mumbai I stopped by the Taj for a quick rest, snack and drink after coming back from Elephanta Island.  The decor and service alone exuded refinement and excellence in service.  Although I was not staying there the staff was gracious and helpful in pointing me to the best bar in the the hotel to wet my whistle.  My party and I ended up at the Mexican cantina near the lobby.  First, as a westerner new to India I was shocked to see the popularity of Mexican cuisine.  I had to try the Indianized Mexican food and ordered a burrito which completely hit the spot.  Obviously, it was not like authentic Mexican food you would find in Mexico or the southwestern United States but it was tasty nonetheless.  To drink, I had a gin tonic with... you guessed it... Bombay Sapphire (I"
"Would definitely recommend this hotel to stay in, as the place is stunning and steeped in history and beautiful architecture.  Just walking around the hotel itself is awe-inspiring.  I would ask for a room in the heritage old wing instead of the tower though, as this is the beautiful part with lovely ceilings and displays.  The tower is not as special and a bit like any other hotel.  Also, beware when booking because a harbour view is not of the gateway.  You will need to book a sea view to get this view.  The rooms are the best in India with amazing marble floors and bathrooms.  Nice touches like multiple plug sockets make the little differences.  The only thing that slightly let's things down was the inconsistent service but we put it down to bad luck.  For example, we asked"
I love this hotel. A fantastic heritage that has been kept completely up to date without spoiling the feel of the building. We had four days here at the end of a three week holiday. Just enough time to settle in and feel at home.  We were booked into the tower but when we arrived we were upgraded to the original Palace Wing. The room and bathroom were luxuriously and well appointed. The bathroom is all marble but fantastically finished so every panel matched.  Little touches like a flower petal arrangement on the floor every day added to the opulence. Every floor comes with a floor butler and Gaurev and his colleagues did an excellent job.  Breakfast and afternoon tea are served in the Sea Lounge where the attentive staff soon get to know you and your preferences. My pot of
"Excellant swimming pool, hot bath, breakfast, room service. In future I'll try to avail other services available in the hotel. The hotel's location is excellant. In breakfast food items are available for delegats all over the world. A foreigner also will get food of his own choice. Items required for swimming was also available. A guard was posted all over the time till the pool was opened."
Excellent location with views of Gateway to India and the harbour. Has the best restaurants in Mumbai and staff very keen to make it a memorable holiday. Large swimming pool and leisure facilities. Would recommend having breakfast at restaurant on the first floor with views of the sea.
"This hotel will be on bucket list of every person in Mumbai or perhaps even India. We finally got a chance to here for the weekend thanks to our epicure membership.  One would say what's s great about the hotel? Ok it's by the sea, has the look of a palace - so what, there would be many more such hotels. But what those other hotels won't have is the famed Taj/Tata ideologies, service and staff. Staff is really the soul of this place (and from what I and the world know the owners understand this and take good care of the staff).  As probably said in most of the other reviews, I too would recommend the palace wing of you really want to indulge in the luxury (ofcourse the tower wing also be good but palace wing has a different charm).  Our experience started at the time of checkin"
"Well. Right opposite the Gateway of India is the Mumbai's not to miss landmark hotel. Besides being a 5-star property to stay in, it is known for its grounds and restaurants. I would recommend the middle eastern food restaurant as it is located on a high floor as opposed to other hotel restaurants. So it offers a great view with your meal."
"We went for our anniversary and Taj made it an unforgettable experience. We has booked a room in the Tower wing but on arrival, we were upgraded to the Palace wing! When I shared that it was our anniversary, they surprised us with a romantically decorated room and a yummy cake. The highlight of the trip was the royal treatment and courteous and enthusiastic staff."
"Excellence beyond comparing. The place, the people, the service. Right from the minute you enter the gate with the security thoroughly checking your car (without being rude) to the hostess helping you choose a room, this is wonderful experience. We were there for 1 night and the Taj team made it a stay to remember. A great place, a great location and the best service you can get in a luxury hotel. Truly a Tata Company owned Principled Hotel, this place will spoil you when you get there. Food is excellent be it the room service or the restaurants, with exemplary service by some of the most polite staff. Having had its share of attacks, the TAJ is truly reborn with every aspect of security being taken care of without compromising on the luxury being offered."
"I stayed at a Palace wing room towards the end of December. Apart from a slight mix-up during check-in where they took approx. 10mins to locate my reservation, the stay was superb.  The rooms are very well appointed and although modern, carry the elegance of a bygone era. I liked the room design and being fairly new, they are in fine shape.  When I returned to the room in the evening after attending an event, I was very pleasantly surprised to find a large copper/brass vessel in the room along with some rose petals and a container of foot salt. A note had instructions on how to use it and a phone number to call for warm water. The foot soak was very relaxing and an inspired idea by the Taj team. I have not had this happen in the past and assume this is a new addition to the Taj"
when yo enter to the taj mahal you feel like you entered to a legend 100 years old very        nice hotel with an excellent service but a few remark to improve: 1. restaurants prices are extremely hight 2. we ordered a deluxe room sea view hight floor but we saw at the elevator that only the 12 th floor and up are the deluxe hight floor... why? in the room at the back of the door (like in all the hotels) nothing was mention about the tipe of the room
"This Taj has the quintessential charm and grace that is a signature mark of the Group. They do it effortlessly. Make the guests feel comfortable and welcome and luxuriantly looked after.   And this place reeks of history. Has held many memorable events. And with the 26/11 affair it is embedded in memory as the saga of courage and endurance, a victory of reconstruction and humanity over mindless violence. The sacrifices made by the humble civilian staff of the Taj goes well above and beyond the call of duty.   Bravo !"
"Taj Mahal Palace is an icon of Mumbai/ Bombay and staying at this gorgeous hotel is always a pleasure. Located in Colaba next to The Gatewayy of India monument, Taj Mahal Palace has a million stories to tell, you just need to listen carefully. Its not a hotel... its culture, its art, its heritage and a pride of the city. The staff is warm and courteous, the rooms are splendid, its boasts of a lovely but rather exposed pool, a gym and spa and high-end luxury brand stores such as Louis Vuitton, Mont Blanc, Dior, etc.  The hotel's iconic nature makes it a center for visitors, even those not staying in the hotel, but thats fine because the Palace wing of Taj Mahal is very special and has no disturbances... the hotel has many fine dining options too, try Golden Dragon., its wonderful!"
This was our second stay at The Taj.  The service was beyond excellent.  Staff went out of their way to be helpful. After checking out a member of our party discovered they had left an item in their room.  Not only did The Taj send an employee to the airport with the item. The employee was sent at 2 am.  Understanding that the hotel is an hour from the airport.  Our room was upgraded and was spectacular.  Dining experiences very satisfying.  We would highly recommend and plan on staying longer for our next visit to India.
Very disappointed.  It's over rated. The rooms are too small and not well presented for the kind of money you are asked to pay. The security is absurd but I guess due to terrorism. The staff are very friendly too and it's a walking distance for the Gateway.
"After a two week holiday in India, the hotel was our last stop and wow! It exceeded all expectations. The hotel had just the right amount of opulence, every corner was beautiful and interesting to look at, needless to say, I did not want to leave the hotel to even sight see in Mumbai.   We initially were booked in the tower wing but got upgraded to the palace wing which was amazing. The rooms were luxurious especially the bed and pillows you literally just sink into it.  The only negative I had is that the food at the hotel was really pricey, a negative for other travelers as well. I have stayed at many other 5 star hotels during my holiday (similar price per night) but this one was the most priciest in terms of food. For example a magherita pizza was about 950 rupee (think it"
Taj Hotel has set new standards in customer service! Their Room Service to their F&B - all are a premium - but VERY well deserved - you can see why they are a cut above the rest of the hotels! I strongly recommend a stay to all who want to experience true Customer Service!
"We went only for afternoon thee there. De hotel is vey nice, nice garden with pool. De staff was helpful. The thee and ice-cream tasted very good. It was a very relaxing afternoon in a very busy city."
"This is the fourth time I've stayed at this iconic hotel overlooking the Gateway to India. Two times before and twice after the carnage of the attack by Islamic terrorists. The term ""iconic"" is often abused or misused but here I choose the word carefully. The beautiful exterior and interior of the ""heritage"" wing reflect to golden age of the British Raj and in this respect it stands as an architectural icon of India. This intrinsic beauty is reflected in the corridors leading to the rooms and the rooms themselves bring a sigh of pleasure after the nine hour flight from London and the insane 90 minute kamikaze taxi drive into the centre of the city.  Of course the major change I've witnessed since the outrage in 2008, is the security at the entrance. The hotel is effectively"
"Wonderful hospitality, professional staff; very warm traditional indian welcome; fast service. Royal room service, nice view from the terrace. Food and Beverage generally is amazing. The ambiences of the restaurants are very nice. Such comfortable rooms that you don't want to go out. They offer free super fast wifi as well as super fast paid wifi."
"We got the service more than our expectations. All smiling faces, everyone greeting on the meet.  The  room was excellent with Gateway of India view from the windows.  Had a wonderful stay throughout. The spa was beautiful with steam room,  the swimming pool was excellent as well."
"By far one of the best places I have stayed. The hotel itself is fabulous and has plenty to keep you occupied. We stayed in an executive suite in the palace wing and the room was just perfect – modern, clean, extremely spacious with fantastic butler service. Attention to detail in this hotel is second to none and the service levels are amazing. Thank you too all the staff for making our stay perfect and a mention to Amrita Singh who provided a great check in and out experience, Ramneet in the executive lounge who looked after us very well throughout our stay and Shetty in the sea lounge. Cant wait to return."
"Beautiful hotel! Like a real Palace! Beautiful swimming pool! I""v enjoyed to swim at 6 in the morning. There are a lot of vegetarian food! However the service could be better. Check-in was during 1 hour. I think it is not good for 5 stars hotel!"
"We Stayed  at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel for 2nights and was worth every penny. From the minute we got out of the taxi until the day we checked out we were treated like royalty. We were checked in by the wonderful and friendly Sharvees who not only checked us into the hotel but accompanied us to our rooms which were in the palace wing.  Each room had their own character and was presented to a very high standard.  Included with rooms in the palace wing is a 24 hr butler who is on hand to attend to all your needs.  All the staff are very polite and friendly.  Breakfast was excellent with a huge range on offer, and the staff were very polite and friendly they just could'nt do enough for you.  The poolside was very clean and relaxing.  The spa was very well maintained I would"
"Taj Mahal Palace at Apollo Bunder in Colaba is one of the best Taj chain of hotels in India.  Located next to Gateway of India it exudes luxury.  It has several restaurants and bars including Harbour Bar, Wasabi... There is an old and new wing of the hotel.  The old wing rooms are bigger and more luxurious and many have balconies and a sit out area.  Behind the Taj there are several restaurants and pubs and shopping areas."
"This was our fifth stay at different Taj properties in India and although they have all been good, this was the best so far.  We cannot fault the service, facilities and most importantly the staff at the Taj Mahal Palace. Every one of the staff, from cleaners and maintenace staff to the management were helpful and friendly to us throughout our stay.   The location was perfect and we found the area to be safe to wander around during the day and evening and there were a number of nice bars and restaurants within a 5-15 minute stroll.  Overall a wonderful experience."
"I stayed here many years ago on my honeymoon and a year later after the terrorist attack and  remember this calm oasis of a hotel that reeked to charm and beauty. Post attack, it has become even more of an icon and the place was absolutely heaving with guests and day trippers . I like the fact that anyone can walk in and have a look and a wonder  as that was the basic premise upon which the founder built this landmark hotel. However if you want a bit of calm and not harassed looking staff , then this is not the place to stay. We were upgraded to the old wing which is lovely and charming but the rooms were nothing amazing and I think the refurbishment has not been entirely sympathetic . The staff however who on previous visits were friendly appear to have forgotten to smile or"
"We spent the weekend in Mumbai at the Taj Mahal Palace. It is fair to say that our expectations of the hotel were very high, given its history, but we were totally overwhelmed by the beauty and grandour of this fabulous building. If I said that the service and attention to detail was very good I would be doing the management, and staff of the hotel an injustice! It was beyond anything that I have ever experienced. Everyone was efficient and friendly, nothing was too much trouble and the venue itself is everthing that a hotel of this stature should be, and more. I think that the thing that I was most impressed with was the attention to detail that has gone into making the customer experience paramount; Well done."
The service in this hotel is beyond the norm.  Staff members are very friendly and they really make you feel welcome. Room service is conducted twice a day.  Love the fresh flowers in the lobby and also throughout the hotel.
I was in this hotel for eight nights at the end Feb 2016. My room was without a window. There are a big post in my bathroom and it was hard to move around nor to shave as the light is not enough. Very expensive for the service you get. I payed 275 CAN $ per night.
Mumbai has always been the starting or finishing place for our frequent holidays in India.We have over a period of time stayed in many of the top hotels here and always only for one night so have never sampled the full facilities such as the pools and restaurants.This trip we decided to stay in Mumbai for 3 nights and chose the Taj which many would claim to be the best in town (the Oberoi would disagree ). We arrived after midnight and a long flight from the UK .Check in was fast and the staff very helpful .We had chosen a room with sea view/Gateway and in the morning were not disappointed .Breakfast was good but not the best I have had in Mumbai (that was in the Oberoi ) Time for the pool .This was fairly small and we had to wait for over an hour to get two beds ..

"We stayed at The Taj Mahal Palace on a family trip for three nights and booked luxury rooms in the old part of the hotel.  Everything about this hotel, staff, service and amenities was wonderful we loved every minute of our stay at this historic hotel in the heart of Mumbai."
This is a beautiful monument. It is magnificent and lovely architectural piece. What a place to be and a pilgrimage for lots of people abound from different parts of the world.Good leather materials are found here in the shops before the  entrance . Excellent!
"Taj Mahal Palace is the best in Mumbai after ITC Maratha. Facing Gateway of India, it gives a magical experience. It is close to all famous tourism attraction like colaba causeway, marine drive etc. Service- 5/5 Food- 5/5 Cost- 5/5"
Fantastic location adjacent to the Gateway.  I had two stays one at the beginning and one at the end of my Indian holiday...my rooms were upgraded for both my stays and I had lovely views.  Great service.
"Excelent hotel with perfect location in centre of mumbay. Rooms very clear and you feel nonusual atmosphere in this colonial style hotel. All restaurants have nice look and food Staff very helpfull and smile.I' d like to  recomend Taj Mahal Palace , who love high quality in collonial style"
We stayed for 3 nights in the 6th floor of the palace wing. Room was beautiful. Great to have an internal lobby so no sound from anywhere which aids great sleep in the heavenly bed! Breakfast choices in all restaurants was lovely and drinks and food at pool very nice in the evening. We had a lovely and extremely comfortable stay with very attentive staff in an historically interesting hotel near major site seeing attractions in Mumbai. You have to stay in the palace rather than tower as its all part of the special experience.
"We stayed here on a touring holiday.Very smart hotel --good rooms with tea,coffee available & a safe.Nice pool area but a little crowded. We ate in The Souk restaurant & I had a cough & the waiter brought me a cup of masala tea without the milk & sugar as he said it was what his children had for a cough to soothe it.Also very helpful when we were deciding what to eat--really nice guy. Food was excellent.Security at the hotel was tight (only to be expected) with cars being checked before entering the forecourt & bags had to go through a scanner."
"just stayed here for the first time since the restoration in 2010. The Heritage wing is worth the price -- the room, the service, the elegant staircase and furniture. This is one of a kind luxury.   I recommend the 5 PM hotel tour -- it helps you appreciate all the fascinating aspects of the hotel -- including the historic photos tucked away near the art gallery.   The restaurants are all fabulous. Particularly good meals/service at the Chinese, Indian, and Sea View."
Our stay at The Taj Mahal Palace was a delight. From the external appearance to the internal decoration the hotel was magnificent. Our room had everything you could possibly need and the marble bathroom was beautiful.Service throughout was charming and efficient. Breakfast was superb. Altogether an outstanding hotel
This is excellent value for money. A hotel with such history anywhere else in the world would cost twice as much. We have been even upgraded in a heritage part of the hotel. Everything was perfect. Do not miss the pool.
"I had the fortune to stay in the original wing of the Taj in Mumbai and was never disappointed. From the welcome to the farewell it was faultless service and a superb experience. I was fortunate to be given a room on the top floor of the original wing of the hotel. The rooms were extensively renovated a couple of years with great effect. The new rooms evoke the quality and refinement of old with a refreshingly light pallete of materials. The various lounges where I enjoyed breakfast and evening drinks were also sublime, decorated with great furniture and finishes throughout. A truly great Hotel."
"What an experience! The hotel offers a level of service rarely matched in Europe, having stayed at Claridges in London last summer which I thought was as good as it could get, I have to say the The Taj Palace far exceeds the standards set in London! Staff are well trained, friendly, polite and helpful. the standard of the rooms is exceptional, beds large and soft with beautiful crisp linen. Would recommend to all discerning travellers."
"This hotel isn't cheap, but it's worth every penny. This was our treat and it lived up to expectation. Service excellent, offered ( and quickly accepted) upgrade of room. Buffet breakfast outstanding. recommend you take breakfast on the roof top restaurant for the view. Pool area beautiful, hotel spotlessly clean. All in all couldn't fault it"
"We travelled to Mumbai specially to stay here and it did not disappoint.  We stayed in the Palace wing (not sure why you would want to stay in the tower, which just looks like another normal hotel).  The service is unparalleled it is proper old school and like stepping back in time. The butler and house keeping service is amazing.  Every time you come back to your room there is a little surprise waiting for you.   We dined one night by the pool where they run a BBQ which is pretty good. The Indian restaurant is amazing, expensive but the quality and food are well worth it. Breakfast is in place the overlooks the gateway, the views are amazing.  The breakfast food selection was OK but I actually expected a bit more variety.  In summary stay in the Palace wing yes it is more"
"We had there 4 days and they were as a dream . It was a real palace room , staff , decoration , food and the most important people is House Keeping who made our stay in a real palace .  From the very beginning we were welcoming as kings and queens . We were just wondering every day in the hotel to discover a new thing . We tried all the their restirants Japanese , chinese and indian and plus the the othet three returants for breakfast they let you not to feel boring from having your breakfast at the same rest. They gave you choises so you can try one everyday . Their service is amazing they even upgrade us when it was available let us use the lounge 24 hrs for free . The Concierge let us see Mumbai even the daily life starting from 5 AM . So we cover everything by following his"

"Brilliant service, cleanliness of hotel and staff are very polite. The hotel gave us a free upgrade to the Heritage Rooms where the original hotel began. They have a tour of the hotel for the guests every evening. The tour is worth it and interesting!"
"I visit Mumbai at least once a year and in the last 3 years have stayed twice at the Taj Mahal Palace. My last trip (which was in November 2015) was one of the most refreshing breaks that I have had in a long time. This hotel always lives up to its reputation. The grandeur of the building is complimented by the faultless hospitality of the staff. They should applaud their staff for maintaining their service and making guests feel at home. The afternoon tea at ""Sea lounge"" is an experience worth having. I look forward to my next trip!!"
"We arrived at the Taj Mahal Palace on the last part of our trip across India and we were so glad we choose this hotel. Check-in was relaxed, we had picked the Palace wing club room facing the sea, while all the paper work was completed we were shown to the Palace Lounge for welcome drinks.  All the staff we came into contact with, were so friendly and went out of their way to help and recommend places to go. The room we had was brilliant, with a great view overlooking the sea very clean with great house keeping staff. The staff in the Palace Lounge were also very good and looked after you knowing your preferences from your first visit.  Check-out was also relaxed.  Food was very good were ever we ate. A hotel to stay at and a must if in Mumbai,  after our experience would highly"

top class hotel and service is par excellence and a pleasure to stay . something you do not experience in any other hotel chain . may not be that suitable for family holidays but the location makes for this and plenty of sightseeing and places to visit that are within walking distance of the hotel .
"A different side to Mumbai altogether with high rises and superb eateries around, a stay at Taj is a dream come true. The breakfast spread was excellent and the hotel amenities are clean as well. A 5 minute drive to the heart of mumbai by taxi."
Whenever I go to mumbai and I have to stay then its taj only. Lands end or taj mahal. This time I booked for taj mahal coz I had work in south mumbai. Unfortunately I forgot to pay in advance to confirm my booking of 16th feb and as per their system they cancelled my booking. When I reached there I came to know that its cancelled and no rooms available due to make in india. I am a silver tier member but could not get the room. Still the hospitality was good. We had lunch there and moved to another hotel. The staff tried to help us in d best way possible they could. It was my and my staff mistake that my booking got cancelled for d first time. Better luck next time.  Full marks to the staff of taj they assisted me and family like home. Will come again.
"After travelling for 3 weeks in India, our small group stayed at this magnificent hotel.  -  what a way to decompress after the hustle and bustle of the trip. The lounges, the pool,the staff, the ambiance were all amazing.  If you go please take the daily tour offered by the hotel of the hotel, lots of insight and information about the hotels history. The location of the hotel itself was also great - walking was super easy to shopping and all the sites."
"IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE, service ambience, food, everything was perfect, i like swimming pool, gateway of india view. restaurant was having good food.Taj Mumbai was featured on English TV for number of weeks and we wanted to experience the surroundings, service and food. It was lovely coming into the hotel, the welcome was excellent and the building and the room are magnificent. The standard of service is high and the facilities are also worth trying out. We got a map of the local area from the help desk and we would definitely suggest that one should explore the surrounding area on foot. Take a bus tour to see Mumbai if you don’t have much time."
"Excellent staff, awesome location, extraordinary rooms and beautiful views from the room window makes it an unforgettable experience for us. I would recommend that it is certainly a hotel which every visitor to Mumbai must go to."
"I stayed at the Taj palace on business for 2 weeks. I had a room looking over Marine drive, which from the 4th floor is a pretty good view. Food in the various restaurants is good. Previously, I have stayed at Oberoi hotel, so I thought I would try this out for a change. And I had the best stay ever. Somehow, a manager walked up to me, greeted me (still don’t know how they did this!), took me to my room to check in my stay was warm, personable and welcoming.   The rooms and facilities are outstanding, so much so, on a Saturday morning I stayed in and ordered room service. It was actually hard to push myself out. The rooms are impeccably maintained, they are modern, everything at your fingertips.   Mumbai is an incredible place for work and pleasure, the hotel was an oasis in the"

"I only came to experience this majestic iconic hotel and have a coffee as I lodged in another area. The Taj Mahal Palace is wonderful classic, well maintained and it is a pleasure to be there and inhale the atmosphere. I only speak about the ""old"" Taj and not the ugly hotel tower next door. Staff is very professionally and courteous. I visited the Sea lounge where breakfast is also served and has view on the Indian Ocean and Gate of India. The front is surely the best location for your room as well."
"Loved the hotel, Loved the service. everything was simply magical! Definitely coming back and enjoy the beauty of the hotel and service once again. Central to where ever we wanted to be ! breakfast with the view was spectacular and refreshing."
"I am a resident of Mumbai/ Bombay and it has been a dream to spend atleast a day at the iconic Taj Mahal Palace hotel. My husband and I spent our 11th dating anniversary at the Taj on 29th Jan, we had to stay in the heritage wing. They had reserved one of their best rooms on the 4th floor for us, right next to the Gateway of India suite. Check-in was a breeze, the welcome from the tulsi malas, tikkas, welcome drinks in the Lounge to the background on our room as we were ushered to it -beautiful.  The view is absolutely gorgeous during sun down and sun-rise. The guided tour from the lobby at 4/5 pm should not be missed. There's so much history here! We had dinner at Wasabi and on our way back I had a problem getting to the room, due to bad back on account of my (still not"
"The iconic Taj Palace & Towers is Mumbai's iconic hotel, ideally located on Apollo Bunder near the Gateway to India. Yes, this is the hotel that was attacked by terrorists on 11-16-08, and a tasteful memorial is found in the Tower reception. The history of this hotel is the stuff legends are made of, and every imaginable celebrity has stayed here. Nine restaurants, several bars welcome guests. Service is over the top - efficient, polite, painstaking, friendly, warm - I am running out of adjectives. And it is gorgeous from top to bottom. The business center is well-equipped and friendly.This hotel has everyone one could want... at quite a price. It is hard to come up with any criticism at all, so I will just mention that top-level wifi ought to be included. The free wifi is"
"We were inspired to go to India after seeing the TV program about the hotel and it did not disappoint! We stayed in a Palace wing room (the old original hotel not the new 70s built Tower wing).  From the minute you arrive this is such an unforgettable experience, one you will never forget.  You are just in awe wherever you go in the hotel, outside its hussle and bussle but inside at the pool, so relaxing you would not know you were in a mad city of Mumbai! Service was second to none, such tiny details really made it special (I won't spoilt it for you).  The building is so beautiful inside and out.  We had a sea view which was wonderful, overlooking the Gate of India.  Mumbai is mental but great, we did a half day sight seeing (v full day in Jaipur) and was plenty, lots of places"
"Everything about this hotel is charming. We stayed on the top floor of the Heritage wing, and had an amazing view of the Gateway and the sea. The staff were attentive and discreet, and the service impeccable. This is a rare and venerable establishment, and one hopes foreign visitors will respect its history and traditions. (Please, no more European tourists shuffling around in the public rooms in bath robes and slippers!)."
"If you want to experience a traditional way of the hotel and leissure industry and indulge yourself a mothwatering gourmet moments with relaxing sensation in the middle of the humming city of Mumbai, this is the place to go."
"We stayed in the original hotel with Club access, this was well worth it. The room was beautiful with lots of little touches, and the Club Lounge warm and welcoming with great helpful staff. Having seen the Taj on TV in the UK we weren't disappointed at all.  Location is great for the gate of India and lots to see within an easy walk."
"Visited this hotel as a day visit many years ago and always vowed to go back to stay. We stopped Christmas Eve and Christmas Day as our treat as part of a 4 week tour around India. The hotel security is tight but do not let that put you off staying as once inside you are treated like royalty. We arrived early but were allowed to check in and were given a room in the Palace and received an upgrade with a personal butler.  the receptionist showed us to our room and then the butler arrived with tea and our bags were brought. The room was comfortable, spacious and luxurious and it was great to have 2 days of comfort and to be able to sleep well. We booked champagne high tea for xmas day which was wonderful, so much choice of food and champagne and it made for a wonderful alternative"
It's quite nice relative to its surrounding and it's really got the old luxury feel to it.  I think they serve forbidden beef burgers at the bar at least for this burger around the world event which I guess is kind of interesting.  Everything here is overpriced but that's why there is such a divide.
"While having heard so much about the historic hotel, I must say that my stay was a bit disappointing. The room was an executive one, but it was not comfortable if you compare it to the same hotel in Delhi where I've stayed 3 times.  Main down side with the room was its design, noise from the road, stale fruits, fixtures & fittings and colors. In terms of food, the Indian restaurant was nowhere near the taste you get in Taj Palace in Delhi. It was quite disappointing. The Chinese was okay, but not excellent either. Views of the Indian Ocean from the room were disappointing too due to the share volume of filth and pollution dumped into the ocean. Staff was polite as you'd get in most Indian hotels. All in all, I was expecting a lot more than what I experienced."
"What a lovely hotel, clean, comfortable, spacious rooms, bathrobes, slippers, just great. Staff friendly, Patrik in particular was lovely, nothing was too much trouble for him, and he even made sure we had a bottle of champagne in our room to celebrate a Birthday! Breakfasts were really nice, and there was sparkling wine to wash it down, and the food was constantly being replenished. I would suggest that anyone with long hair, take their own hairdryer, as the one in the room kept on cutting out when it overheated, usually when I'd just about dried my hair, and given it's a very short haircut I have I would have struggled otherwise. Also nothing to do with the hotel itself, the road outside was very noisy both from revellers into the early morning and lorries, presumably emptying"
The Iconic Taj Mahal Palace at Mumbai near Gateway of India is a place where everyone dreams to stay at least once in their lifetime. We (me and my wife) had celebrated the Valentines day there and it was an awesome experience staying in the Heritage wing.
Good Housekeeping staff special Mr. Hussain but rest of the staff at reception and restaurant found to be rude. Need to improve the guest relation after all its Taj Palace. Kindly note that guest who had taken the membership are the people who trust the brand and not those who came for a free stay. Will not recommend to take the membership in Taj Epicure.
"This was a special treat for us of just one night after a months travelling on our first visit to India,what a beautiful place and just to sit and watch the comings and goings was well worth the money. The staff  treated everyone as valued guests and were so helpful and friendly,we should have had a city view room but we were upgraded to a sea view looking over India Gate which was lovely,there are no complaints whatsoever and we would love to stay there again one day."
"Superb hotel which lives up to it's reputation for service. Great staff, great views (Palace wing). Great restaurants. I know it's India, but try the Golden Dragon for an unforgettable Chinese meal. Masala Kraft is the excellent Indian cuisine restaurant.  Try both if possible. Book a Club Room as it comes with all sorts of extras which are worth having, such as a 24 hour butler service."
We only spent one night here but it was a really interesting hotel to visit wiht the tour one of the highights. A great choice of restaurants which were not too expensive for a 5 star hotel. The room was extremely comfortable.
"Suposely The best Hotel In town! The rooms are pretty cool have To admit, but you dont feel like being in India! A good stay after all but I  won't miss it. I dont know much about Bombay but i'm sure there are other places around more charming and welcoming"
I'm completely floored by hospitality at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai. Those cute little surprises for my 14month old daughter and the smile everyone carries are things which are priceless. Got room of my choice with nice sea view. Overall if you believe in class and priceless hospitality-then Taj is the place.
"Nice hotel, great staff, and good food & service   Location is perfect near all the shopping and resturant   Some rooms are over looking India Gate and the sea   Always take the rooms at the Palace side rather than the tower which I think are nicer   The hotel has its own shopping arcade which I think is very nice   The pool is ver nice   Regards"
"I wanted to stay here prior to starting a pilgrimage and all I wanted to do was to soak in a hot tub after a long flight from NYC and a long drive from the airport to Colaba where the hotel is located.  I was not disappointed.  The room was in the old wing and it was just what I needed.  The staff is extraordinary in the service I received from the check-in process, room service, wait staff at breakfast where I was seated with a stunning view of the Gate of India, to check-out.  There are many areas of this property to explore and I wish I had a bit more time to do so.  You'll find the usual suspect ""luxury goods"" vendors on the ground floor, but why shop there when you've got India at your doorstep?!  The Taj is walking distance to where you can hop a ferry to Elephanta Island"
"Wonderful place to stay,it was just a one night treat for us after seeing the programme on television,it was worth the money just to sit in the Lobby and watch the comings and goings,staff were great and all seem very genuine and happy in their work. We would love to stay there again one day"
A great place to relax. We stay one night in this Hotel. Had a room in the Tower wing with sea view. In front of us the gate of india.  It was a sunday and the place in front of the gate was full packed and noisy but after 10:00pm its getting quit.
I always choose Taj Mahal Mumbai for location and luxury. The service is impeccable and the view of the Gateway of India unforgettable at dawn and dusk.  I shall be returning next year to the friendly welcome of the Palace lounge.
"A must stay in Mumbai (Bombay). Beautifully appointed furnishings. From elaborate wood carvings in the lounge area to the marble accent pieces. True elegance. Service was over the top. We had breakfast on the penthouse level when our waiter engaged us in conversation and suggested trying Indian food After I had just finished a breakfast. The Indian food was delicious and when I asked where on the buffet that I could take pictures to remember, including the names of the dishes He informed me that he asked the chef to make something special. That has never happened in all of my travels. That is one example. In addition there are beautiful shops-clothes, jewels, art galleries, chocolatiers,and gifts. Out door dining by the poolside. a pictorial gallery of the different stages of"
"We took one of the best decisions of our lives when we decided to spend our anniversary in this hotel.  Everything was perfect. From the first impression during the check in time through out the 7 days we stayed there.  It is very hard to please someone for such a long time and, yet, there was not even one single issue that bothered us. Nikhil (swimming pool guard), Shivanand Kuday (intern) and Imtiyaz Khan (personal trainer), Clinton (waiter at the restaurant at the top of the tower) really delivered beyond costumers service. They are phenomenal and deserve a special and big THANK YOU! Shivanand prepared us a little book to commemorate our 6 years anniversary and ALWAYS greeted everybody with a genuine and beautiful smile.  Imtiyaz has an amazing knowledge of exercises and he"
"The service was not good at all. The hotel must make a big effort to retrain all their staff. Check in at the hotel was OK but they did not explain the facilites available, for example breakfast time, location of various restaurants, wifi availability.  Worst of all, we were in a room on 19th floor and suddenly there was non-stop banging from the room next door and was explained that this should stop at 2.30pm because of some refurbishment but the banging lasted all day! We could have been offered a room on a different floor but nothing doing...."
I booked this hotel online and this is the awesome hotel with best rooms and best amenities food here is up to the mark  Staff is very friendly always waiting for the order very impressive location is also good in short it was worth to pay this much  Highly recommended 
"it was my 3 rd visit at your hotel. This time I took 2 DLX rooms and it was not DLX at all.  The bathroom was like in  a 4 star Hotel, the room was very simple and I did not feel the  amazing  ambiance that I felt in my  previous time. this time I paid around 20,000 INR per room.  I am not sure i will recommend your hotel to my family or friends any more like I did it before."
"My business colleagues and I spend 2 days at the Taj Majah Grand Hotel.  I have traveled extensively around the US and around the world and typically stay in some of the finest hotels in the world.  The Taj is right up there at the top of the list.  The staff is exceptional, the faciites, the rooms and suites and the restaurants and the pool are all top notch.  Treat yourself the next time you are in Mumbai and stay at the Taj."
"Staying at The Taj Palace Hotel is an exceptional experience. Grom a simple detox juice by the pool to a full meal at one of the outstanding restaurants, is is bound for aunique and very satisfying experience"
"Not enough space at breakfast, pool side or other amenities to accommodate the sheer number of guests. Staff contradicted each other when answering questions or when seeking advice and never really seemed to know what was going on leaving the guest none the wiser. A victim of its own success relying on its illustrious past rather than keeping up its historic standards."
Its the most beautiful hotel..warm welcome..we stayed on our first wedding anniversary..and the hotel doubles our celebration by decorating our room by balloons and a complimentary cake..it was just awesome..the hotel staffs were very friendly..
"You can't have this feeling & charm of Mumbai staying in any other five stars - no matter which ones may have popped out through the timeline... Regality, hospitality, classy crowd, that Royal ambience, details down to the micro; everything, I'd say everything is so Taj here! I must have stayed at every equivalent hotel in Mumbai but this one is The One! Thanks Team Taj for a wonderful birthday that I had at your place! "
"Stayed on the club floor in the Taj palace. The whole hotel is really beautiful. The suites are really nice, well decorated, with plenty of marble. We had an anniversary whilst we were there and the hotel made our stay memorable. I found the club facilities lacking compared with other hotel club extras. The hotel is well located with easy access to many city attractions. "
A great hotel to stay in - if only just to say you did it.  It is expensive to other 5 star hotels but the service is faultless and the finishes are quality (except for our bathroom which was a bit dated)
"Too long to go into detail, but basically, we paid a lot of money for the room and the room/service was terrible. The only good thing about the room was the bed - it was comfortable and we slept well."
Stayed at THE TAJ MAHAL on Valentine Day weekend to Celebrate Valentine & our Anniversary. The Hotel made it extra special by upgrading us to the Executive Suite at the Palace Wing of the Hotel. The room was just awesome and it blew us away. We were completely pampered with the complimentary bottle of wine & fruits and the lovely rose and balloon decoration in the room. The Heritage walk which explained the history of the Hotel was the highlight of our stay.
"We had come from a superb modern Palace in Delhi and were going to the Oberoi for a conference so this was a treat. It is a grand old hotel, full of charm, (do watch the video of its history) the staff were simply outstanding, everyone from the floor staff upwards was so charming and friendly. Beautiful room, amenities, pool, thoroughly loved our few days here. Outstanding views - do have, breakfast, lunch or tea in the  room overlooking the Gateway -  so much to see if you get a window view!"
"It was truly an experience of a kind staying at the iconic Taj Mahal hotel. As expected, the room was tastefully decorated and well-equipped with all splurge amenities and comfortable bedding. I was truly impressed by the sublime level of attention of detail by staff - they have gone out of the way to make me feel special, in brewing guests a cup of tea, bookmarking my half-finished book left behind on the bed, or uncoiling the nasty tangle of laptop power cables under the desk - all at their own initiatives. This aspect of service has greatly exceeded my expectations. The breakfast at the sea lounge was another highlight - good food and services, needless to mention. But above all, I was treated with a commanding view of the Gateway of India - simply magnificent!"
"I got upgraded from the tower side to the palace side and it was amazing. Service was top notch during my whole stay. Breakfast was very good and there was plenty of options. Wifi was fast and they had ethernet port to use cable if you need one. Laundry service was inexpensive, fast and convenient.  Only problem I had was this musty smell in the room that the cleaners tried to cover with flowers and air freshener lamp but whenever I turned the lamp off, the smell was there again.  Restaurant selection was good, but the food wasn't the best I've had in India so it's still worth trying to find some food outside the hotel. The hotel gets also very busy during day time because of tourists."
"Reception was impressive, with concierge taking me to my room and luggage arriving right after. There are plenty of restaurants in the hotel with all kinds of food. You can choose to sit in the garden by the swimming pool or on the top floor with a great view of the harbor. Right in front of Gateway of India and direct boats to Elephanta Island. Close to the Queens Necklace (Marine Drive) and many other attractions in Mumbai. Well worth the money."
As you would expect everything Is beautiful and perfect. Staff was very attentive.the bed was big and confortable. It would of being nice to see smiling a bit more to the waiters of the swimming pool bar.
"This was a splurge for me, not my typical kind of hotel choice. (Actually the price I paid was about the same as a mediocre motel in Iceland.) I chose it for the experience, and it was worth it. I paid for the tower but was upgraded to the rooms in the main building. The room is nice but nothing super-special but the ambiance, the hallways full of art, the whole building, the service, and the breakfast (with view in the Tower) were all great."
"Just arrived at this hotel after two weeks in India at various hotels/locations. This was supposed to be the perfect end to a holiday of a lifetime to celebrate a special birthday.   Found the staff to be totally disinterested and rude. On checking in was told that the Sea Lounge served high tea until 7pm and on arriving there was told it was closed. Surely the staff should have been aware of this. After asking for an alternative we were directed to the coffee shop, where we had to wait for our order to be taken and then 15 minutes later they came back to check the order.   The hotel although beautiful and in a great location, so far leaves a lot to be desired. I was expecting an excellent standard of service from a hotel that supposedly excels in this and am thoroughly"
As you enter through the gates you know you visiting one of the top hotels on planet earth. As with the way things are security is tight. Once you get into the lobby you are are looked after from the beginning with tea and coffee (complimentary). There is a vast among of staff and one is quickly assigned to check you in and show you round.   The building is beautiful and the atmosphere buzzing.  I have stayed in a couple of five star hotels and I was pleasantly surprised to see the prices for food a drink were not crazy. I also payed for my room what you would expect for a very good 3 star hotel or a poor 4 star.  I would recommend looking into this place if you are in Mumbai. It's an experience that you will want to talk about back home.   
Beautiful Heritage Hotel. Spacious and luxurious rooms furnished in a traditional style. Fabulous bathroom with a spacious shower cabin and good shampoos etc. The room service is very attentive. I left my tablet on the table and when I returned to the room they provided a screen cleaning cloth. Nice pool and cafe. Breakfast buffet is nice and rich with a good choice of local and international dishes. 
"We had a wonderful few nights in the Taj - everything was perfect - the room was very comfortable. Highlight was the warmth and attention of the staff throughout the hotel - subtle, yet professional. Highly recommend a stay here."
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal in February with my boyfriend. I had a great experience with the concierges and the waitstaff in the hotel's restaurants. (Satish from the concierge was especially awesome). However, I had a terrible experience however with my laundry and how the situation with my laundry was handled by senior management staff which forces me to give this ""5 Star Hotel"", a low rating.  I sent my clothes to be dry cleaned only to have them return with a disgusting fuzzy residue over the garments, in other words, they ere ruined. I had just had the same items dry cleaned in Dubai a few days before with no problem. There was a lot of back and forth between me, different members of housekeeping and ultimately the front desk staff, the clothes were sent back numerous times"
Visited with family in December and stayed in the Palace Wing - which was a real treat.  Great rooms and a unique ambiance throughout the hotel. Arrived too late for breakfast so ordered room service which was expensive and took some time to arrive. When we returned to the room early evening nothing had been cleared away.  Don't want that to detract however from what was a very special experience and look forward to returning in 2016. 
"We had a great stay at the Taj. We had a club room facing the bay, the view in the morning was lovely. Overall the service was great and it was truly a great taste of the city. The food in the hotel is quite pricey, best to eat of if you are trying to keep your bill to a reasonable amount."
"Loved this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our brief stay here. The staff are so very nice and attentive, they make you feel at home. Our room was cleaned to the last spot every day and in between the housekeeping staff would come in for a brief check and re-stock! We had a view of the Gateway of India from our tiny balcony which was nice. The hotel is very grand and historic - it was such a delight to stay here."
"Exceptional Stay – from hotel pick-up to check-in to overall stay, we had no disappointments and a truly enjoyable time.  Our stay was in the Palace-side with a room facing the arch and water side (recommend asking for one of these rooms) with a very nice room, comfortable bed and large bathroom facilities.  Wifi is fast and the 24-hour service never leaves you wanting anything and our breakfast was included in the room rate – offering a very good election based upon ones dietary needs.  Please be advised, there are three places to have breakfast (we used the location on the 1st Floor of the Palace side) and even though they offer a buffet, you can have the chef cook you anything desired – so don’t forget to ask.  Prior to arrival we used the Concierge Service to set up day"
"we stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace on the 19 nov for one night,from the moment we arrived to the time that we left we were treated like kings and queens,the service is beyond belief. we were upgraded to a suite I can not put into words how wonderful the room was, the pool area magnificent shown to your sunbeds towels laid out water on your table. the hotel is out of this world."
The best of all hotels. I cannot complain about anything. The service and the hotel was outstanding. Beautiful clean rooms  with maid service twice a day. The breakfast was excellent  and the staff really pampered you.
"Hadn't been here since before the shameful attack. I must say, they have bounced back with outstanding aplomb and dignity. we loved it. Excellent rooms, brilliant breakfasts and service. First class service in the Club lounge  Overall, a"
"We booked room in their Tower wing but were surprisingly upgraded to a more luxurious room in their Palace wing. Taj's hospitality is always commendable, entire staff is always ready to be at your service and very courteous. Looking forward to many more stays at Taj Hotels worldwide."
This was a great way to end our trip in India. We spent most of the time in the northern part of India which is not as westernized as Mumbai so coming to a hotel like the Taj with updated amenities and the amazing architecture was a great treat.  The hotel is directly on the water so you can see India Gate and also all the boats on the water in the mornings and in the evenings. It is walkable to many places in Mumbai and easy to catch transportation for things that are not.   The hotel was quiet and the beds were comfortable with clean rooms. I would highly recommend staying in this hotel when in Mumbai!
"This true 5* hotel is well worth splashing out on. Youll feel safe, well looked after, the facilities are second to none, great pool, sauna gym etc, the best breakfast out there. And the local school doing carols was lovely, if slightly contrived. Book early, find a deal, and go. "
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for business. It is a world-class, beautiful hotel with great colonial charm. The rooms, food, the pool and views were great. I would highly recommend it. The service of all staff is exquisite."
Despite an unfortunate terrorist event a few years ago I felt very safe at this property.  There were at least 30 security guards and staff members surrounding the building.  My room was in the old tower and could use some upgrading but generally it was clean and comfortable.  The hotel is really beautiful and is in a great location if sight-seeing is your plan.  The Colaba Causeway is a 3 minute walk from the hotel.  I was here on business so never got to do any sight-seeing but we drove by many of the sights and they were close to the hotel.  The pool looks amazing!  The hotel restaurants that we visited were great....breakfast was superb.  I would recommend this place as a business hotel or a hotel for those on vacation.  I hope to go back as a tourist one day!
"I was to make booking for two nights at taj blue diamond  pune. My taj epicure plus member is 101014157823 DHIRAJ JAIN .I am having two vouchers , i wanted to use one vouchet which is flat 50 rack rate. When i was making my booking the rate available on taj site was 13500 with taxes but i called on taj reservation they said you have to pay 23500 for two nights, then whats the use of membership. I asked that why this much difference the rate should be same tyen he said that its better u dont use the voucher its of no use, if you go directly you will get cheaper rate. I want to request you members dont take taj membership, they are not loyal to us. I am very diappointed with such services bu taj."
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace Tower for two and a half nights (my flight left at 3 AM) on a business mission. Overall, the hotel is OK, although the Palace part is much nicer that the Tower. The room I had was a bit banged up and smelled badly when I first arrived. A thorough clean the next morning took care of that but still. For the price I would have expected better. On the positive side, staff are polite, friendly, and helpful."
"The Taj is a beautiful hotel in the middle of Colaba (a neigborhood in Mumbai).  We stayed in the original Taj palace.  It has nicely restored rooms with a beautiful view of the bay and the Gate to India.  It is a lovely hotel.  I would definitely stay in the older Palace part of the hotel rather than the newer, modern tower that adjoins the lobby.  Food isn't really anything speical....breakfast buffet is nice, but otherwise typical hotel food.  There is a beautiful pool with an outdoor restaurant.  Great service and a willlingness to please abounds."
"It was a toss up between either the Taj Palace or the Oberoi but I have to say I am so glad that we chose this hotel. Only the Taj can give you that special experience of staying in such an iconic building full of character and history not to mention a great location and superb service throughout.   We were upgraded to the Club room (we had booked a normal room in the palace / heritage wing), so that was a pleasant surprise. Check in was done in the room, no waiting in the lobby, a nice touch! The room had all the amenities you can ask for in a hotel of this standard and the 24 hour butler service was faultless.   We went on the guided tour of the hotel which happens every day around 4 or 5 pm (I can't really remember exactly) which was very interesting and informative. The"
"What a superb hotel, was excellent stay from start to end. The hotel is immaculate in every way. The cleanliness , food, service is outstanding as are the rooms in the palace wing which we stayed in for two nights. The overall Experience was amazing and the hotel should be very proud of all their staff. Security was high and felt comfortable all around the hotel. High tea in the sea lounge is wonderful with a comprehensive buffet included. Personally we would have liked to stay longer but will definatley return. without a doubt this is the best hotel I've stayed in and it also as lots of history too. The location is good with lots around the area to keep you entertained. The Leopold cafe just being one of them and only a few minutes walk. Overall excellent and would highly"
"This is the most amazing place in the world and it's made by all the wonderful staff! Most of all by Reshma Pathan. We will never forget our amazing holiday , thank you all so much! Best tip/ book a club room as you can use the club lounge and it's worth every penny!"
"Went for 30th wedding anniversary December 2014/15 for 6 nights because of watching the TV series about the hotel, found it to be very over rated and expensive how ever breakfast was fantastic as was the service, but the food and the drinks are extortionate! even more expensive than the Burj Al Arab Dubai. however had a nice stay but would not go again, this is not a slur on the hotel its just that I believe that there are better hotels in Mumbai but of course without the history."
"A must stay- even if just the once. Highly recommended choosing the Palace Wing over the Tower (a newer construction without the history and interior beauty of the palace). Other recommendations: breakfast at the Sea Lounge, next to one of the windows, looking on to the gate and the sea. A 'club' level room is a must: an excellent high tea is served at the Palace Lounge from 3.30 to 5.30 followed by drinks and canapés from 6.00 till 8.00 and culminating with cognac and chocolates from 9.00 till 10.00 All well worth the extra hundreds.   Excellent service and very relaxed atmosphere."
"I enjoyed my stay at the Taj, the pool is fantastic and all the staff I encountered were wonderful!  Breakfast was a treat, huge choice of great food.  Harbour bar was a fun place for an early beer or cocktail.   Unfortunately my room had an adjoining door and the guy in the room next door had a terrible cough- at a hotel of this standard the room should either be insulated better or saved for groups.  Also building work on the tower wing disrupted my relaxation as the noise was very loud.  A shame as otherwise this is a very good hotel."
"The Taj is one of those hotels you need to stay at least once. The staff are very helpful. Room was clean, not as spacious as I'd expect for the £150 per night. The pool was also good as was the steam and sauna rooms. Breakfast was great as you can choose from three locations. Food was freshly cooked and varied."
"Booked this hotel as part of our India Tour after seeing it on a TV program at home. Wow! Everything we ever wanted in a hotel and more. Greeted as old friends in the Reception Lobby which was simply mind blowing, fresh scent piped through everywhere, huge flower displays, immaculate. Shown swiftly to our room which overlooked the Gateway to India, very luxurious. Had a great sleep in the massive bed. Staff were very friendly, swimming pool is amazing. Free wi-fi and we even had a wi-fi butler! Had lunch out beside the pool, very expensive but really tasty. Really tight security at the front door as you would expect. The cakes from the on-site cake shop were superb, lots of other shops on site but they are pretty expensive. Breakfast was amazing and we were served extremely"
Very good hotel . Location is also excellent . Had a very pleasant stay. Large clean room with plenty of space. Definitely recommends Taj Palace for their excellent service and accomodation. Breakfast is great both at sea lounge and the roof top.
We stayed here for 2 nights and from the moment we arrived we knew we were somewhere special. The pool is great to relax round and there are constantly staff around cleaning and making sure the grounds and well presented. The flower arrangements throughout the hotel are beautiful. Breakfast was great with plenty of choice. I even tried the gym and it was well furnished and the equipment all in good condition.   I would love to stay here again.
"We had a wonderful stay. The staff are only are ver professional and only to willing to help and correct anything that may go a stray. Great location in the heart of Mumbai, right outside the Gate of India"
"An extremely nice hotel, flanked with a superb view to the gateway of India.. Not the cheepest hotel in Mumbai...;-) , - but compared to western rates you simply have to make a stay in this hotel.. My best recommendations, - have them to make a guided tour, you'll hear an impessive story about the terror attacks and the rebuilding of the hotel...."
"Love this place we have been here twice now and it does not disappoint. We were kindly upgraded to palace room on arrival, staff couldn't do enough for us.  Everyone in this place has been obviously trained to the highest standards, so courteous and helpful.  Spotlessly clean a haven in the hustle and bustle of Mumbai."
"I stayed three days in February,  2016, in the historic Taj Palace, as opposed to  the newer Tower. The hotel is beautiful, luxurious and spotless. The 2008 terror attack on the hotel may still be fresh in the minds of some, but there's no sign of a security presence beyond what you'd find at any other five-star hotel in Mumbai.  What is off-putting, though, is a kind of sniffy superiority exhibited by some of the staff. I'm a Canadian of African-Caribbean descent. I'm black. On more than one occasion at the hotel, I watched as staffers looked me up and down before inquiring if I was a guest. The question is a  standard one, but the manner of questioning was without doubt much less welcoming than the greeting I saw extended to my fellow hotel guests who were white or Asian. I've"
"Well, I really wanted to stay here and it was almost everything I hoped.   Pro's: -Luxurious lounge -Best breakfast buffet ever -Great Swimmingpool -Excellent service, felt like a queen -Best location, good restaurants close by - Great view  Con - We had a room in the Tower Wing. It is a little underwhelming, maybe because the rest of the hotel is so luxurious. The hallways are even a little dull, needs refurbishment I think. I think a room at the main wing is better. We did have the BEST view of the Gateway of India... so i shouldnt complain.   Stay here, if you can!"
"A must stay to experience luxury with rich history, legacy! One must be part of Palace tour which informs about Mumbai city and hotel's past and its years of journey. Amazing experience to be a part of! Would certainly recommend to one and all."
"It was my first stay here in-spite of my numerous visits to mumbai in the last 20 years. I had an impression that it was just a Taj hotel. It is 'The' Taj hotel. I stayed in the new wing (the old heritage wing is the place to stay) and the room was adequate, well equipped and clean. The bathroom were slightly dated. It is the hotel staff which changes the classy heritage hotel into something unique with feelings. The staff are super polite, helpful and forthcoming with their suggestions and advice…right from suggesting Khichdi for my stomach discomfort to serving me food at 3:30am. The food quality is super and they even served pan with the dinner in the room. The downside are the luxury stores inside the hotel which makes you lighten your wallet swiftly. The gym is good and the"
"We stayed in the heritage wing of the hotel and its simply breathtaking.  Right from the hotel decor to food, everything here is exclusively designed to entice the guests.  We had an amazing time at the restaurant masalacraft and its a must try for everyone who is here.  The pool area is a great way to relax and unwind.  The rooms and its interiors are extremely arty and gives you a real feeling of staying in a palace   Most importantly, the staff is very warm and polite.   It's really a privilege to be the guest of this hotel and would love to come back everytime we could.  "
What's a pleasure to be at the Taj Mahal.It's princely welcome.A dedicated staff where not a single stone is left unturned. The wecome Tika and the Tulsi necklace makes you feel how important you are and welcome as a special guest. The Beautiful Ladies nicely draped in their gorgeous sarees. It makes you feel you are well coocooned. Recommend to other if they have the opportunity to try it at least once in their life time. We have experienced these treatement during our last five visits. We looked forward for the next one. Mahendra Kumar Bheekee Inner circle member no.101014118293.
"Mumbai was our final stop in our 3 week tour of India covering Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Most of the hotels we stayed during our trip were Taj or affiliated and we were pleased with the level of service and hospitality offered. We were hoping for the same, if not more, at the flagship Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai.  Unfortunately this has not been the case. We have been disappointed at the way our booking has been managed - we are a group of 8 and booked single and double rooms. Attention to detail was totally lacking in the check in process. Single occupancy guests were offered double rooms and vice versa. We have had to change our rooms twice for various reasons. Apart from an apology, no goodwill gestures have been made for the error on their part and the subsequent inconvenience. "
After a disastrous start over a room misunderstanding I fully expected to not enjoy our stay here  However it was pulled together by the manager of the poolside restaurant  He could not have done more for us and made our stay in this hotel better than we initially thought it would be  Rooms are lovely and it has a great atmosphere  I had to give it 4 stars as sadly for customer service it does not match the Oberio for quality and customer care  The tipping I also found very wearing  which I never felt at the Oberio hotels  However I do not wish to detract from the staff as they were very good and it was a lovely stay with special thanks to the poolside they were wonderful 
"A wonderful hotel with old world charm, fantastic staff.it throws one instantly back in time and it is a very comforting feeling. The architecture  is simply awe inspiring, the breakfasts  luxurious. Rooms are large and very comfortable . A great place to relax. The club amenities should be experienced"
this is a famous historic luxury hotel in a unique place. all the vicinity of the hotel is interesting and easy to walk and tour. the palace wing is renovated and shiny. it is well worth to pay more for a room in the palace wing prefered with gate of india view. i enjoyed the club room with airport transfer and club lounge. the high tea is a better experience at the sea lounge than the club lounge. the staff is very good and present everywhere. in my opinion the palace wing of the taj is the best experience for a mumbai visit.
"i spent three days with my family at the iconic Taj Mahal Mumbai in Jan 2016. enchanting feel.generally one tends to get overawed by these large hotels, but not here. from check in to check out every aspect was as smooth as one would like it to be.we got a free upgrade from the tower wing to the palcae wing as 'my family was large""!!. you expect such pleasant surprises only from the taj. the restaurants were a touch pricey but no complaints on the quality. we got a room which unfortunately had no windows(i came to know later that the palace wing has a few such rooms). otherwise even for the most choiciest customer would be spoilt for choice- luxury part or the food part tried the chinese , indian and arabic restaurants and each of them was a cut above. the japanese restaurant"
"Stay in the historical wing for one of the all time best city hotels in the world.  One of my all time favorites. Accommodations, food, service, pool, spa all top notch.  It is hard to find fault with the hotel."
Best hotel ever We all satisfied of the services they rendered. Food at the restaurant excellent!!! The only hotel I like in Mumbai with great food and views. Soon I'll be back again.  Everything was really excellent. Security was excellent doing there job. 
"A wonderful hotel.  Beautifully appointed and with a very friendly and attentive staff.  It's like a calming step back in time. The minute you step through the door, you forget that you're in the middle of a bustling / chaotic city.  I would highly recommend this hote."
It was great to stay at this wonderful Hotel. Except some negative Service issues at the breakfast (SEA PALACE Restaurant) all was 100% positive - we shall be coming back to Hotel again. Pool side with Restaurant is very pleasant.
I stayed in the heritage wing which of course was massively damaged in the appalling atrocity but has now been fabulously repaired so there is no sign of its recent sad history. The rooms are very stylish and historic and the butler service is faultless.  Breakfast is the usual international spread wig the bonus of looking out in the sea and the gateway to India.  If there was one slight negative it was that the reception area was permanently very busy which slightly detracted from the otherwise exclusive feel.
Superior service all around by all staff members.  Beautiful museum like hotel.  Food excellent. A must stay if visiting Mumbai. Location is right beside Gateway of India and other visiting spots. Pool area is sublime for swimming or relaxing. A great oasis in the middle of a vibrant city.
"It may be twenty years since I last visited the Taj Palace but it is everything I remember as a truly wonderful hotel in both its architecture and dedicated staff. Their attention to detail is truly beyond that which most hotels deliver, regardless of the number of stars they hold. As an example, I left the case for a pair of sunglasses on a table, when I came back staff cleaning my room had left some glasses cleaners beside the case. That's more than just providing an excellent service of expected high standards it's about going the extra mile. I know it is one of the most expensive hotel options when staying in Mumbai, particularly if, as you should, you stay in the original 1903 part, but it really is worth pampering yourself. The staff are so very friendly and caring without"
"This property is, quite simply, a fantastic example of luxury yet understated service in the best, most stunning location in Mumbai. As soon as you drive up and see the property, and it's location by the waterfront and the Gateway of India, you know you're at a special place.   We were initially booked in the new wing but, on check-in, were very kindly upgraded to a room in the main palace. We were staying with our 11 month old son and, from the moment we stepped in to reception, we looked after wonderfully well.  A cot and toiletries were provided for our little one, which was a nice touch. The staff were so friendly and knowledgable about everything and yet discreet; sometimes in places they can be little in your face but now here.  We didn't eat in any of the restaurants"
"Right from the start, everything is just taken care off! The warm welcome and supporting service was excellent! The staff knew customers' exacting requirements even before the customer opened their mouths. Nothing seems a bother to them!!"
Brilliant the best hotel we have stayed in for a very long time .The staff were so attentive and caring. The best way to finish 3 weeks in India stay at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai. Bedrooms perfect beds and pillows so comfortable.
very well decorated rooms and good outer view and good service provided by them. The best thing about is that you get best meal to it whch include every type of food.its really facinating to see beautifull scenery.
"Although I had an amazing time, I do feel that it was not worth the expense as much as it was. The food was great and so was the overall stay, but i reckon the price is a bit too much for what the hotel has to offer and the staying in the cheapest room didn't effect my stay."
"My husband and I stayed here for one night before we flew back to the UK and my god are we glad we did!  This hotel is one of the most beautiful, luxurious places we have ever stayed in! The staff are extremely hospitable and helpful.  Our room was a Luxury Grande in the beautiful Palace Wing, overlooking the harbour with the most fantastic view of the Gateway of India right outside! The room was so beautifully decorated and extremely luxurious, from the all marble bathroom to the soft furnishings, I took plenty of pictures for inspiration for my own bedroom!!!  We went on the hotel tour which is an absolute must as it give a very interesting insight into the hotel and it's history. You learn things about it that you wouldn't know if you didn't go on on the tour. There is a"
"I have been in Taj Mahal Palace for business conference. Very clean and neat hotel. Staffs are very helpful. Food is awesome, have all types of food available. Very nice stay, view from top room is very good specially room at sea side. Will definitely visit again."
"Highest standard of customer service ever experienced in a hotel. All staff are there to ensure the customer's stay is at the optimal level. Nothing is missed, and all is to the highest standard. A memorable stay and oasis in this vibrant city."
We spent three great nights at the Taj in January 2016.  We had booked a deluxe room in the Palace wing and were delighted to receive an upgrade to the most amazing suite.  Thank you Taj Mahal!  Everything in our suite was appeared to be new and the artwork was beautiful.  A quiet haven to come home to after a day in busy Mumbai.  Service in the hotel is excellent.  We enjoyed breakfast in the Sea View Lounge each morning and drinks in the bar each evening.  All of the staff are helpful and smiling.  Security is tight and we always felt safe.  Lovely swimming pool with nets to keep the birds out.  Highly recommended.
"I went to the Taj Mahal for my meeting last month. We had booked the banquets for our Managers meet. Right from the entry till the time we left the property it was extremely classy, no doubt why my friends speak a lot about the place. It is not only the history but the people working there who made my visit a memorable one. The attention they take for each and every guest deserves to be mentioned. To name a few of the people who made my visit to be one of the best are- Srinivas, Saurav (they were the managers in charge of the banquet), Mendes, he provided us everything we asked for. He never said No to us. I forgot the name of the housekeeping manager, all that i remember is DK that is what his initials are. When i requested him to make my room he took the initiative and did it"
"My wife and I celebrated our 15th Wedding Anniversary at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and were very well looked after.   We were booked into the Seagull Suite, the light and airy decor coupled with amazing views of the Gateway to India and Arabian Sea was a real treat.  The communal areas of the hotel oozed charm and elegance as did all the staff we encountered who are a real credit to the hotel. The staff certainly ensures the hotel attains World Class status.  Suite and Club room guests have access to the Palace lounge with hot and cold drinks plus pre-dinner drinks with hors d'oeuvres (go easy or dinner may be a struggle)! We didn't which meant we failed to make it to after dinner drinks and chocolates on each of our 3 nights!!!  The pool area is a joy and a real oasis amid the"
A stay at the Taj is unforgettable; experience the best service in the world in this famous landmark hotel steeped in history. It is truly an oasis of calm and refinement within the bustling surrounding of Colaba. I could rave about the wonderful staff and amenities but I think the most complimentary thing I can say is that the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel brings out the best in her guests; you cannot fail to be happy here.
"Truly unique place. Great staff.  Such a history and a very elegant conversion to a top rated hotel.  Make sure to take the small informal tour, if you have the time, In 45 minutes, you get to discover and appreciate so many treasures that surround you."
"No better place to stay than the palace wing. Loved everything about the hotel. The location, history and service are tops. Pool area a wonderful respite. Don't even consider staying anyplace else. Love it."
"I am highly recommend this hotel in Mumbai. It will give you the experience of traditional Indian culture, as well as modern amenities. Whenever I visit Mumbai, I always prefer to stay in Taj Mahal Palace."
"Our second stay at this property and again everything was impeccable. The rooms were perfect and our every need was taken care of. The food from the buffet, room service, and the restaurants was all great. We stayed for the final two nights of a family members month-long visit to India, and she returned to Canada with terrific final memories!"
We were on transit through Bombay and decided to stay here. Had too much of an expectation from this place but alas there were some goof ups. We were a little early and hence decided to checkin and leave our baggage behind and go out. We returned back quite a bit after the usual time of 3PM but alas there was some kind of hand-off issue and hence we needed to re-chedked in and wait for a room. I was expecting that a hotel of this cadre would have sound proof rooms. We could hear all the revelry and noise from the room way past midnight. Security in the hotel is not how I expect in a 5 star. Any guest can go in and out in the residential floors which I found a little disconcerting.
"Thishotel has real class, hats off to Mr.Ratan Tata to give us such a wonderful experience. I have stayed in many five star hotels , but this by far is a best hotels .Food, drinks ,hospitality everything was awesome."
"The old building is charming and full of beautiful paintings. I stayed at the Palace wing Club rooms overlooking on the Harbour. Perfect welcome with the red dot on the forehead and a nice necklace, check in the room! Loundery delivered in a basket with a bag smelling lavander. I kept it to remind my stay. Small but very clean spa. excellent massage by Kareem(?). The detox tea generously on display at the relaxing space is a marvel. No problem with the free WiFi in the room. To visit the magic Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (formerly The Prince of Wales Museum), I had a limo with an elegant white uniform and hat driver from the hotel. Free! Don't miss at 5PM the historical visit of the building with a guide; the Taj Mahal Palace is part of the history of the city"
"we spend our 15th anniversary and they made sure it was a memorable one.... cosy and comfortable and awesome food... service at its best... we tried Sea Lounge, Souk and Shamiana.... all awesome retaurants... it was on my bucket list to stay at Taj Mahal Palace once and what hospitality we got..."
Rooms in the new tower are nice but if you can get one in the old part you will be lucky. Public areas are what you would expect from a 5* Hotel. Food is excellent and all tastes are catered for in the 7 dinning themes.
"A week end nicely spent at Tajmahal Palace Mumbai. A good sea view & the monumental Gateway of India was the high point. The food was great with extensive spread for breakfast. Though a lot of people came at the peak time, the staff made table arrangements and food availability efficiently. The service offered, in general, was excellent. The staff went out of their way to see our comfort."
"The hotel is luxurious and beautiful. As soon as you enter you are Royalty.  Our dedicated hotel manager Amrita was the best.  She gave a us a full tour of the hotel and has sound knowledge about the different parts of the hotel.  We upgraded to sea view room.  The view from the room was perfect, directly opposite the India gate, the room was full of LUX living from in-service dinning, bed turnover before you sleep and the bed was perfect giving us a dreamy sleep. Morning breakfast was awesome we had breakfast at the top area overlooking the whole of the India gate and the sea.  Perfectly fresh treats from traditional dishes to the best of the western foods, breakfast for champions.  The restaurants are fully booked so make sure you book in advanced you cant just walk in and"
Had a great relaxing stay at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Went for a staycation with my husband and was a truly great break. The room was overlooking the Arabian Sea and had a great view. The breakfast at the restaurant was very good as well.
First time travelled with trip advisor and found good service partners like Taj Hotel with good room service and pick up and drop service. will visit again soon in next coming month for a businees tour.
"service was good and so was breakfast but found the roo,, slightlly disappointing, smaller than expected also main areas quite crowded (queue at breakfast or difficult to seat in the main hall) lifts not very fast keys was demagnitized 1 time also"
"The Taj Mahal Palace lived up to all of our expectations of a five star hotel. The staff were excellent, incredibly friendly and helpful.  Our room was beautiful and very well serviced as was the entire hotel. The selection at the breakfast buffet was excellent and we ate at one of the restaurants one night which was exceptional. It is in a great location for all the tourist activities in  the city as well as surrounded by several excellent restaurants and bars.   Highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a bit of a treat."
"What a brilliant place to stay in! Super luxury. Everything you would expect from such a prestigious hotel. It was run like clockwork, staff always on hand to help but unobtrusive. We had a sea view room which was amazing. Watching the sun rise and set from our room was special. The restaurants are all quite different and excellent. Food and service perfect."
"I was in Mumbai for the equitymaster conference 2016. Last year too I was there for the conference and stayed at the Taj. This year I had promised my family that I would take them to the Taj. There were five of us, my mother, wife and two sons. I had booked for the tower wing and was pleasantly  surprised to be put in the palace wing. Overall a fabulous experience. Thank you, Taj."
"Beautiful hotel located on the Shore front overseeing the gateway to India monument. I can't think of anything negative about my experience here. The willingness to provide the best possible experience was remarkable.  Lovely restaurants, excellent food... My room was luxureous and very clean.  Hope to return here one day! "
"After watching all the tv programmes and hearing all the hype about the Taj I finally decided to give myself and my family a treat on our last visit to India. This the best hotel experience I have ever had, the rooms were immaculate and the staff were so helpful and friendly, it definantley lives up to the hype. If you are in Mumbai and can afford it then i would absolutely recommend the Taj."
" outstanding service, friendly staff, excellent location, fast checkout, very good breakfast. i have been to several Tajs around India and this one provides the best service. the others should learn from this one  downside: takes a lot of time to unload the luggage for ppl travelling in group  "
"I stayed in this hotel  with my family ,My first time in Mumbai ,My Family's first time in India My first impression was it was over rated ,and i was disappointed that I was not given adjacent rooms (I had booked way in advance) ,I had children is was a difficult checking on them , although i was given rooms on the same floor ,corridors are long ,I was told the were full ! thier was a wedding and a seminar   the other disappointment was the pool and spa was avrege  I was comparing them to other hotels the Operio in Japour and the spa of Liela in Delhi , then after a day or two I appreciated the hotel because the service is excellent , rooms very clean , they have amazing restaurants , I loved the Nan bread in Masala Kraft and although I missed going to the Golden dragon was told"
"This hotel is like a jewel in what can be a hectic place to visit. The service, the beautiful and spacious rooms, the choice of restaurants and attention to detail cannot be faulted. One feels that every staff member knows you by name and cannot do enough for you. Would not stay anywhere else."
"Stayed last week for 3 nights.Were upgraded to a superb suite,stunning,with views over sea and gateway to India.This hotel is perfection,from check in on,staff excellent.Booked the 4 hour tour in limo ,amazing,and excellent way to quickly see Mumbai when don't have much time.Breakfast was really good,everything you could want,toast made for you ,asking if you wanted it well done,lightly toasted  or whatever.Had dinner at pool one evening,lovely setting.Cant wait to return.Thank you all."
"The hotel has featured in a recent UK TV programme and we found it every bit as good as described. the staff are very attentive, nothing is too much trouble. The location is very good, near the gateway of India, and there are a number of restaurants in the surrounding area.. We were upgraded from a room in the Tower to  the main building - rooms are very comfortable  but basic rooms,  while well equipped, are not large though they have all amenities.  Bed is comfortable. The many restaurants are very good though relatively expensive in comparison to the modestly priced rooms. Overall a hotel worth visiting for the experience alone."
it is always important to me travelling continuosly to find a structure that makes me feel as close to home as posssible and in this complex I found only the best making my stay a memorable one with all the requirements i needed fully met... the friendliness and curtessy and most off all readiness to make my stay comfortable were definatly met!!! thank you
"Beautiful hotel with amazingly friendly and helpful staff, set in a wonderful location right on the gateway to India. This is a truly iconic hotel with a reputation which is well deserved in my opinion. It is a true luxury hotel and I would highly recommend to anyone that visits Mumbai to stay here for at least one night. It  is very expensive both to stay at and once you are there, but it was worth it. The only downside for me is that the food and drink is insanely expensive for this part of the world."
Spent one night on my way back home. The hotel upgraded me from the Tower to the palace and it was just admirable. The security is also tight and good to see. Limousine service to Airport was a great experience.
"We visited Taj Mahal Palace's Michelin starred restaurant ""Wasabi by Morimoto"". We've been in many Michelin-restaurants before but this was something else. The music was loud and felt like we were listening to some local radio-station. The waitresses took not much interest in filling our glasses and seemed to be more occupied strolling past us as if we weren't even there.   After dinner we took the elevator downstairs to Harbour Bar and ordered two gin tonics. Tonics were 40 euros per drink which was way too much considering the gin was the cheaper, local brand.   Rooms felt out-dated - there were construction material hanging outside our window and when visiting the lobby we were constantly asked about our passports and whether or  not we stayed in the hotel or not. Even"
"Every thing is an outstanding top class: Impressive building in strategic location: Gateway of India. The lobby is huge but give you comfortable feeling. Sea point restaurant for breakfast with sea view is commanded before starting the busy day; food is deli shes and service is excellent. My room was in third floor with sea view: huge and comfortable, only negative point was little noisy from street."
"Didn't seem Taj - Extremely below average room - The room was extremely worn off - from door locks to drawer knobs everything just gave away. the décor was average, look from room is spoken than better. overall looked like we stayed in a lodge, We have been trying to book this property from more than a year and were really looking forward to our stay , however it turned out to be the worst of all among all Taj properties I have stayed across the world. Consolation was that the staff was courteous, food was good and other parts of the hotel, amenities etc are excellent , but we come there for rooms - don't we?.  Seems like that such a room was given because it was 'Free'- sas we were using our Taj innercircle membership free voucher. Even the booking was possible after"
Hard to fault the hotel.Service of high standard although not too accomodating for a late check out.Breakfast outstanding as is the swimming pool area .Spa excellent but the free wifi very limiting.Plenty of restaurant choices in hotel as well as nearby. Hotel is expensive for India but worth it
The best hotel experience I have ever had. Very friendly staff. Beuatiful place. Room was great as well. Enjoyed the spa.  Book well in time to make sure you have the experience in the older part of the hotel.
"It was our wedding anniversary & family's holiday after completing Shirdi pilgrimage. We all received a ROYAL welcome with garlands & quick check in formalities . The staff had surprised us with a CAKE & balloons in the room.The Rooms are HUGE in Old block with latest amenities/ gadgets .  Rooms had wonderful view of the POOL,  The buffet breakfast was Lavish & unending ."
"Dream came true after decades as to experience a gorgeous hotel in city where you live,  is a challenge but me extremely happy to take, so decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary by staying in the suite, unbelievable grandeur royalty, traditional heritage n richness, the ambience the feel the originality touch one's soul to be blessed to be here, everything was taken care absolutely in professional courteous smiling way pouncing their sense of serving you like a king. The cordial impeccable service at palatial lounge was adorable, food at masala kraft was giving fragrance of original spices in original ethnicness.  Poolside area is heavenly.  Give 100 out of 10 and feel of such property in my city "
"The Taj Mahal Palace hotel is part of the history of Mumbai, which makes it special. We stayed in a sea-facing room that lets you soak in views of the gorgeous sea, the crowds milling about the Gateway and the never-ending lines of boats heading out with tourists.  The food in the hotel (a smallish lunch buffet  spread ~4k per person) seemed a bit overpriced even by 5-star standards, but the good news is that the surrounding area has plenty of options. The room was comfortable, the staff was courteous, all of which is as expected from the Taj brand. Overall we had a nice experience at the hotel."
"It's like going back in time  to a wonderful regal era.  The service is amazing.  We ate lunch at Souk on the rooftop, walked around Mumbai and returned to the pool area and had drinks and a fabulous dinner.  Our waiter was very friendly and nicely generous in pouring our wine!"
"We have recently returned home following  a 14 night stay at this beautiful hotel. In some respects words fail me when trying to describe how wonderful our stay was. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, they are trained to a very high standard and are beautiful inside and out. My only suggestion for improvement would be to transfer the warmth of service your staff show to customers  to some of the receptionists!!  They are the last  contact a customer has, that would have made our stay absolutely perfect.  Thank you for a wonderful holiday"
This is THEE BEST Property I have ever been to in India. The service is outstanding and the staff are very friendly! excellent!! I  was particularly happy with the room and the wonderful view of the Aravian Sea. The Location is also brilliant and markets have come up around this hotel to make it the best get away spot in Mumbai.
This is truly the place to stay in Mumbai to get a close experience to this vibrant city. Had a room with a sea view overseeing Gate of India. Easy to walk around out side (even took a run in the heat). Fantastic service at the top level.
"Well we had heard and seen TV programmes about the Palace. It did not disappoint. Security is tight, which is reassuring. Staff were so professional. Our room in the tower on the 9th floor looked out over the gateway to India, just magical. Food and drinks are not cheap but hey this really is 5 star. A great start to our trip."
Hotel taj is very beautiful hotels in india.it is one of the largest and attractive hotel among all hotels in India.here all facilties are avilable.it is best because of their hospitality and good quality of sevice
"Hotel Taj Palace Mumbai do not need review at all. One of the best hotel in the world. Rooms are Luxuriously prepared, See view rooms are premium location, no of options in food for all nationalities, swimming pools, Decent Bar, poolside Coffee bar, Historical architecture... a present experience."
"Stunning building , location and service . Luxury service and surrounding in this hotel which is next to the Gateway of India .   Staff as expected superb , hotel immaculate and I must say probably my first choice when I come back to Mumbai .   Go visit and enjoy ! "
Beautiful hotel and good location. Swimming pool is quite big and nice open area.l had a very good breakfast at the 21st floor  over looking the gateway of India.Weak link is the rooms which are tiny but the service is very very very good. Definitely visit again.
"The Taj Palace in Mumbai lives up to its name and reputation. My friend and I had two marvelous days there feeling as if we were princesses. Our every need was thoughtfully attended to...including the travel desk which went to great trouble to help us change a flight. The rooms are beautiful, authentic and well appointed. The breakfast overwhelms with delicious choices. The staff impeccable (especially our personal butler!) I felt as if I had been taken back in time to another era where gentility played a larger role than profit. Do yourself a favor and stay in the Heritage/Palace wing. You will thank yourself and have a memory of a lifetime."
"We had another amazing stay at the Taj, we took friends for the first time to celebrate birthday & retirement on arrival the room was full of balloons, flowers, foot baths  and a cake, what a welcome. We look forward to our next stay. only one problem our room was opposite the lifts so we found it a little noisy."
We just popped in to have a look at this famous hotel but ended up staying a while in the lovely harbour bar. The barman was a true pro great serving us lovely cocktails (well he has been there 38 years he was telling us so he knows his way around a bar). Good place to spend a fews hours people watching and get a view of the gateway to india.
As always a truly fabulous hotel - service impeccable and very friendly. Wonderful location opposite India Gate. The rooms in the palace wing are superb  extremely comfortable. We have also stayed in the tower wing and nothing to complain about. It is definitely the staff who make this hotel one of the greats in the world
my partner was born in Bombay and hadn't been to the city for a very long time and insisted we stayed at the Taj. she booked a room in the old section of the hotel which is marvellous. we were generously given an upgraded room which was fantastic. the staff couldn't be more helpful and the atmosphere is terrific.
"After a few weeks in india, the Taj was a nice variety to the exhausting india.  The staff at the Taj was extraordinary friendly and helpfull, especialy the housekeeping.  The ancient room was so beauty, and also the hole palace was an experience due the colonnial style of the architecture.   Recomandations:  -The food at the palace -Breakfast in the tower -Spa and the Fitness -The staff  critics:  -The extraordinary prices due the extraordinary experience in the hotel."
"Great hotel with excellent service. Excellent location. Just infront of the Grateway and to have an excellent view of the sea and the Gateway. Very good service. The personnel attending was very cordial, taking extra care about my stay."
We went to have lunch at the golden dragon restaurant. While we were waiting for our food the cockroach came from under the table onto our plates. We did not eat at that restaurant or any other restaurant in this hotel after this incident.
"The service level that guests can always expect is just FANTASTIC . In particualar the services that guests can expect from guest relationship team and the personal intervention at main lobby level by the hotel General Manager is terrific , while the warmth of the staff across all restaurants ...... Over the TOP !"
"We stayed in the old Palace wing, Wow what an experience.  First of all the staff are just fantastic and make you feel so special, all of the staff no mater what role they perform. The on floor butlers and staff are simply the best and cater to your every need.  The rooms are wonderful, large and kept lovely throughout the stay.  The hotel is so historic, we did the 45 minute afternoon tour what history, do it on the first day to appreciate your surroundings more.  Pool are is out of this world and a great place for a few hours R and R.  We had the breakfast option which gave you access to three restaurants on site, we tried all three, nice buffet's the Sea Lounge and the Restaurant at the 23 floor of the Tower were brilliant.  We had a fantastic four nights here, I would return"
"We were initially booked into the Tower but were upgraded to a room at the Palace, facing the courtyard/pool.  The hotel has apparently had an extensive renovation following the 2008 attacks, and the Palace wing is flawless. The sumptuous marble bathroom, the surprisingly large rooms, the fabulous Taj service. The place truly is a palace, and the history of the place is pretty interesting to - do the heritage walk if you have time. I don't think I want to stay anywhere else in Mumbai!  A few comments:  For once, I actually went to a hotel gym, and this one was superb. Enormous, a huge range of equipment including a rower and a squat rack, which you don't often see in hotels - usually just a row of treadmills and some free weights! The personal trainer and his client seemed a bit"
"We decided to stay at the Taj for the final few nights of our 3 week Indian tour. As part of the overall experience we booked the Taj car to collect us from the airport which was a lovely way to arrive. The hotel itself is just outstanding. We had booked a Palace Wing room and were upgraded on arrival to a Club Room with views over the sea and India Gate. The room itself was perfect with a really good sized bathroom and also entitled us to the entry to The Palace Lounge where every day we enjoyed complimentary drinks and hors d'oerves which was just fabulous! The staff were very friendly and welcoming. We spent a couple of days just relaxing by the pool which was very enjoyable. The casual dinning options were great, breakfast in the Sea Lounge was delicious and we also had a"
Stayed in the old building and enjoyed a lovely 4 days here. Pool was crowded but the staff managed the situation well. Had sundowner drinks in the bar on the first floor overlooking the gateway - wonderful way to start the evening. Staff are great.
We stayed in this magnificent hotel over Christmas and it was total luxury!! We had a fabulous room in the Palace Wing the staff treat you as a VIP at all times. I treated myself to a massage which was heavenly and value for money. The tea they serve you whilst in the Spa was beautiful.. I wish I knew how they made it (great tasting). The pool area and garden is wonderful too. I must mention the smell.... The hotel smells gorgeous!!! They use electric ceramic lamps with heated mandarin oil which gives off a beautiful fresh smell constantly. Stay here...you'll never forget the experience!
I had visited raj hotel in december ending i.e Christmas and had an awosome experienceat there and really liked there hospitality and the views .the hotels has spacious room i rate this hotel 4.9 out of 5
"WOW - what a lovely hotel.   Service started at pick up from the airport. Journey took over an hour and the car had free WiFi.  We booked a club room in the old part with sea view. In my opinion: don't book anything else.   The hotel is awesome and perfectly restored. View from the room over ""Gateway to India"" makes one feel very much part of Mumbai.  Bed was great, A/C worked well. Bathroom good, disappointingly bathroom amenities felt a bit ""cheap"". Molton Brown, it was not.  Club lounge was heavy on the A/C, so take a cardie. Drink service during cocktail hour was somewhat slow and food uninspired, non- Indian.  Breakfast in the lounge restaurant was much better. Lovely view over the sea and good spread of both Indian and Western dishes.  Highlight was the Indian restaurant"
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for 4 nights in January 2016 for work. The hotel is beautiful, overlooking the Gate of India, harbor, and city. The service was very attentive and the food delicious. There is ongoing construction but it could not be heard. The only negatives were the very cold air conditioning, which isn't something European guests are used to, but it was easily solved by spending as much time as possible outside by the poolside where a gentle breeze made it perfect. Anothe rlittle thing is the possible noise level from adjoining room, there isn't great sound proofing due to connecting doors. Something to keep in mind for guests flying back on a night flight is to make sure to check out by 8pm to be charged only half a night instead of a full additional night."
"We stayed in the original building and are glad we did. Our beautifully refurbished suite was tastefully furnished with a contemporary feel. It was spacious, elegant and offered beautiful views of the bay. The service was more than attentive and the restaurants were quite good. There was also a comfortable club lounge (that got a little too crowded at times) but offered good food."
"What a perfectly fantastic hotel.  Every one should stay here at least once in their life. We stayed in the palace wing and it was pure luxury from stepping out the car.  Everything is taken care of for you and nothing is too much trouble.  We arrived a little early for check in, so we were seated in the palace lounge with a complimentary drink whilst they quickly prepared our room, which over looked India gate and the sea.  The room was large and well presented. The bed was huge and bathroom had both a shower cubicle and a large tub. There were plenty of UK plug sockets.  We were very lucky to meet Mrs Gupta, from the BBC documentary. She was lovely and spent time talking with us. We also spoke with Mrs Daruka from the documentary, she was equally lovely. It was great that a"
" a lot of variety and glamor will attract u to the its fullest luxury... go and reach the best in industry called TAJ lavish, luxurious, service and quality are the main components wrapped with taste and humor all around to view upon and observe in liesure"
"Arriving at 2-00 AM check in was fast, simple and sympathetic with the The Duty Manager personally escorting to the Suite.  The Taj Group have always had great Staff Training schemes but the big difference at the Taj Mahal is they have encouraged staff to be natural and the perfect service is not over the top as found in so many big Asian hotels.  An example is the Bell Boy who collected my case arranged my taxi for the day at a very reasonable rate and it and my luggage were at the front exit after a fast checkout."
The way the hotel staff takes care of the guest is commendable and extremely of highest standards. My room was upgraded on the special occasion of my wedding it was really pleasant surprise to us. Looking forward to visiting again.
"We had such a lovely stay here over Christmas. The staff were all lovely, and brought us some xmas decorations as they realised that we were missing Christmas. We had a fab view over the Gateway to India from the Tower wing. It didn't matter that we were in the Tower, the rooms were gorgeous and views completely insane. Food was delicious everywhere we ate in the hotel too. Obviously its pretty pricey but definitely worth it."
"Staying at the Taj should be a requirement for all visitors who want a taste of 19th century India.  The staff was elegant, articulate and polite.  The free 5:00 tour was something we have experienced only at one other hotel- The Linden Centre in Yunnan, China.  We will definitely stay again!"
"The hotel lived upto its hype, especially if you're a history buff. The verandahs, stairs, columns and stone facade are from a different era. The rooms were nice too; we got one facing the Gateway of India. Service was good. The lobby is bustling though, and our bags took a couple of hours to come up. Other than that, the stay, check-in and check-out were excellent."
"The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is a landmark hotel. It is a signature Taj Hotel. Whilst I have stayed there numerous times in different kinds of rooms, this time I was put up in Grand Luxury Room in the Palace wing. I was disappointed with the size and the interior decor of the room... The room was small... As I was expecting the same sort of room in the palace wing when I stayed there 6 month ago. That room was absolutely magnanimous! Unfortunately cockroaches slipped out of the toilet sink and they took it up very seriously and changed me to another room which was as good.  However this time the grand luxury room on the 6th floor of the palace wing was rather small, and the bathroom was tiny! The room itself did not have a proper desk, chair or mirrors, as would be expected at"
"Location is great but it's far from the all the night life. It's in the middle of historical area where you can breath history. Service in the hotel is simply amazing. All the crew are smiling in your face trying to help as much as they could. In the lobby, you must look for Farida. She's an amazing helpful girl that always doing her best to support & guide. Simply I'm sad that I'm flying back & ending this amazing experience. Definitely I'll be back again. "
"WOW!!! Our India agent, Chris, Ventours, upgraded us to this outrageous 2 bedroom suite that  was worthy of royalty...After traveling a week through India, spending a few days in Mumbai before boarding our Seaborne cruise was magical...Service was, warm & attentive...We ate in four of the hotel  restaurants, each one a culinary feast... Breakfast on the main floor over-looking the bay with vast options to select from was  our favorite way to start our mornings...Location of hotel was perfect...close to sights & great shopping...and a short drive to ship dock..."
One of the iconic Taj properties. We stayed in the Palace Wing and the rooms there are out of this world.  Overall a very great experience.  These rooms have an old world charm and they come with the legendary Taj Hospitality.
"The hotel is definitely exquisite, with excellent service.  The location of the hotel is great, and it offers great views of the Gateway of India.  Walking distance to Colaba Causeway as well as several restaurants and shops.  I'd definitely recommend staying here for a trip to Mumbai!"
"Had a Wonderful Experience during my Stay at Taj Executive Suite on the Palace Wing. The Service , hospitality was amazing i really didnt feel i was in Mumbai unless i checked out & came out of hotel,  the feeling during the stay was like i was in different planet."
"What a stunning hotel and great service!  the pool area itself is like a vacation in a very crazy city.  I would recommend staying here to any vacationer or business traveler.  They really nail the small touches, like slippers for bed time, meditation oils for the weary traveler, etc."
"This hotel is outstanding, not only for its looks, but for its service, hospitality and range of restaurants. You won't be disappointed. The staff was extremely friendly and was there to assist you before you'd even started asking a question. Superb."
"actually I went to this hotel for attending the business conference. so, i don't know about the rooms. the conference hall was really amazing !! amenities were excellent ! Wifi speed is really amazing. food was really mouth watering !"
It cant get any better than this. The staff was really great and the room service was excellent. Food was amazing. the view from our room was the pool view and it was so good. From the moment we stepped into the hotel we were blown away by the whole experience. Truely Taj!!
"Amazing place to stay at. The service was truely something special. The food was exceptional, the staff maked you feel right at home. Never have i experienced such a royal service. Only regret is that we stayed for only one night. Should have definitely stayed more."
"the building and the location are fantastic. Service is perfect, food is marvellous. The pool area and the furnishing are very elegant, you feel the spirit of the city but far from the noise and crowd..."
not satisfied with the room reservation system. I have requested for sea facing room or pool facing room but they allocate me the tower side room from where only the tall tower wall was visible nothing else there was only the tower building next to our window
"Beautiful hotel with frantastic facilities, very friendly staff and service, we stayed in a Palace room which was lovely and ate at the Indian where the food was excellent. We also enjoyed drinks in the afternoon around the pool."
"Spent a night at this property over the Mumbai Marathon weekend. As soon as we checked in we were upgraded to the club room on the sixth floor of the palace wing with 24 hour access to the palace lounge. The hotel was buzzing with activity, people from all parts of the globe moving in and out. The hotel has an iconic structure and the decor is just beautiful with pretty fresh flowers in the lobby. The pool area was lovely, being january there was a lovely nip in the air with fresh seafood being barbequed and served to guests. The jiva spa services are definately worth a try. There are several restaurants so there is plenty of variety for food. The hospitality at this property is commendable with every request being taken care of, the staff were superb."
"High tea at the Taj is a must do in Mumbai. The facitites are open to the public (you do not have to be a hotel guest). The service is in the Sea Lounge on the 1st floor and starts at 3.30pm until 7.30pm. Cost is Rp 1750 per person.The setting is magnificent and the food is great. Guests are offered a buffet of Mumbai street food (hot) and then a large selection of desserts followed by the english scones, tarts etc and of course, english tea. Many people turn up around 5 - 5.30pm and make this their evening meal. However if you want a window seat overlooking the Gateway of India then arrive around 3pm, have a drink and let the staff know you are waiting for a window booth."
"Excellent Service. The taj is an amazing place to stay and offers excellent service.  Every time we are in India, we stay a few nights at the taj mahal before flying out of Bombay. Stayed in the tower building with view of the gateway of india, great. Really pleased with the view and room.  Also stayed in the palace itself which was excellent. Butler service, etc., etc. and with view over the pool and see.  The taj is an amazing place to stay and offer excellent service. The breakfast buffet is superb. Gym was never busy or crowded and I like going for a run in the nearby streets in the morning before it gets busy, 7:30ish am. Pool area is superb to chill out. The restaurant on top offers breathtaking views and superb food is served in all of the restaurants at the taj."
one of the best service i have ever had in a hotel what ever you wish you get very friendly & helpful staff.best location in Mumbai all restaurant and museums & around easy access to everything .hotel ambiance in fabulous.
"Your hotel is the most wonderful hotel we have ever stayed in, not just because of its history and beauty, but your staff are just wonderful, kind courteous and so very efficient. Thank you will be most certainly be back"
Overall excellent experience. We stayed at the Taj Hotel for 3 nights and found it a little expensive if you were to eat and drink there for the full stay. Just outside the Taj you can find plenty of places to eat and drink and for a night cap go back to the Taj and sit by the pool.
"The Taj Mahal Palace and Towers Hotel is one of the premier hotels in the world and certainly THE place to stay in Mumbai.  The building and accommodations are beautiful and the service is impeccable. We spent 5 nights there while touring India and all of our needs were met.  The food was a delight and room service was some of the quickest we have experienced.  The hotel is well located for touring and the swimming pool and other amenities make it an oasis in a hectic, fast paced city."
"Heritage Hotel, but with modern service, good food when breakfast, clean room, WIFI,   near gate of India, good service, I enjoy stay at this hotel, I came for business but I can give a suggestion for bring a family ,"
"We stayed 4 days. It was a stunning experience.  The beautiful room we were moved to 379 was totally unexpected.  The present of a rose petal footpath and spa soak for the bathroom was so lovely after a hard day's sightseeing.  We chose to breakfast each day in the Sea Lounge watching the bustle of boats at The Gateway To India.  Fantastic omelettes.  The pool area was a complete relaxation in the morning before going out for the afternoon.  Everyone was kind and solicitous.  Coming to India for a month was my retirement present after stopping work.  We could not have chosen a better start.  Thank you to everyone who smiled, carried bags, sorted transport, arranged sun beds, made breakfast, cleaned the room and decorated it every day with beautiful flowers.  I doubt I'll"
"Visited Mumbai - the commercial capital of India during end of December 2015. The weather is ideal - not too hot nor cold. Mumbai gate had been built during the British rule and still a great tourist attraction. Just beside this Gate was the famous Taj Hotel; It is a huge hotel - with the new area and the old area. Once you go inside the hotel its is like - a Maharajah's palace. When we went there - there was a wedding taking place too.  The hotel faces the sea, where you can see many boats. In addition, you can drive around the Marine drive, overlooking the sea. We had lunch in a restaurant situated on this Drive.  The other attractions are the many Hindu Temples...to visit. There is heavy traffic most of the times."
"we arrived at the hotel in the evening and was given an upgrade what a lovely ending to our fantastic holiday touring india  and a week in goa. the room was lovely, breakfast was good very good choice we had a drink in the bar nice and relaxing. We lovely the pool. All the staff were very helpful. thankyou"
"Before traveling to Mumbai I had been recommended to explore the adventure of being at the Taj Mahal... Found great deals on internet and here I am: what a fantastic experience! The city with his contrasts is fascinating, skyscrapers shopping malls and business centers close to slums...but the hotel need lot of time as well! Each lounge, each corner tells the story of India. Dont miss the guided tour, breakfast at the sea lounge and the high tea in the afternoon.. A trip in the history"
Hotel staff was very cordial and helpful. Location for break fast at roof top as well as the location of sea view is good. Pool side location is also enjoyable. Lobby area is nice. Restaurants have good choice of food though more choice for soups would be preferred.
My fiance and I visited Mumbai whilst we was on a short day away from our cruise ship. Unfortunately we didn't stay in the hotel but still could admire its beauty and grace with some fantastic history in the area. We definitely would love to come back and stay in this grand palace of a building.
"One of the best hotels we have visited, perfect Location, Standard of Service was excellent and will be coming back in future all being well, The Old part and the history is fascinating the best of the best  have stayed here."
"The Taj is quite simply the best hotel chain I've ever come across. The service is flawless, the rooms are beautiful, the restaurants fantastic. Have stayed in the Taj in Kerala as well as a couple of times in Mumbai and it is enough to make me want to holiday in India every year! Cannot recommend it highly enough."
"well, not only is this hotel steeped in history, it is also very wonderful. We certainly had a room with a view Room 305...views over the gateway and as the sun rose in the morning, you couldn't ask for a better picture! Service very good where ever we went, very interesting tour of the hotel and its history......the first place to have an alcohol license and the bar is still there....naturally worth  stopping in for drinks. hotel restaurants were also good, the indian was exceptional and whilst the Chinese was good, it seemed to be very under staffed as the service was poor. Pool side lovely, helpful staff. Gym well equipped and the spa was excellent. If you wanted anything organised they could do it for you, trips out, restaurant booking etc etc, no trouble at all."
"The Taj Palace has a rightful place in the list of world's best hotels: service is impeccable, rooms and lobby are beautifully appointed, the beds heavenly. Do yourself a favor and stay in the Palace/Heritage section. In addition, it is located in south Mumbai where you have access to great restaurants and shopping right outside your door. The architecture in this area leaves you feeling that you have stepped back in time to a grand era. It is not just a hotel stay, it is a lifetime experience. Bravo to the staff and management who keep it running like a magnificent, treasured timepiece."
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in the ""Heritage Wing"" from the 12th to 14th January 2015.  It was everything I was expecting and more. Those who travel in this style will feel very much at home here. The location, close to India Gate, is fantastic and the hotel is just over the road from the Arabian coast and the sea.  Our king size bed was the most comfortable I've had in a hotel, as were the pillows. The linen is of excellent quality as one would expect at this level. The layout of the room is fairly simple with more than enough closet space located in the entrance hall. The bathroom is a good size with a bath and large shower. The hand basin and fittings are state of the art. Light switches took a bit of getting used to with controls from each side of the bed and include a"
"The staff at this hotel are amazing, nothing was too much trouble.  I had a (very slight) problem with the safe in my room and later I received a letter of apology and a small gift.  The staff were also very accommodating when it came to taking photos...and appearing in photos too!    Check in was easy, the room was nice and very clean. The restaurants and bars that we tried in the hotel were very good.  The staff in reception also recommended some very good local restaurants.  The pool/garden area was beautiful.  The location of the hotel was also very good.  The breakfast buffet was excellent.  We stayed in The Tower, the modern (and cheaper) addition to the hotel.  We were impressed, although The Tower lacks the grandeur of the main hotel, it is still very good.  The rooms"
"We were upgraded to the Palace Wing. Thank you! I cannot fault any aspect of the hotel. The room was beautiful (next time I will pay the extra for the palace wing - it is worth it if you can afford it); every meal we had was exceptional - we enjoyed the Japanese, the Chinese and the Indian. The breakfast was amazing and there is a choice of 3 restaurants to enjoy breakfast (we liked the Sea Lounge most). The staff here are quite exceptional - the service was amazing from each and every member of staff we interacted with. We are hooked and will be back. Thank you so much."
"I have stayed in number of a luxury properties, but this one was one of my favorite - from the history to the little touches they add - the stay was perfect. I stayed in the palace wing for 3 days and really can't find any downside. Breakfast was spectacular - the service immaculate. Will stay again next time in Mumbai for sure. I did stay over Dewali, when usually lots of staff travels - but the service was still perfect. Congrats on the great property."
"Having returned to the Taj Palace this year after having such a sensational experience last year,I was curious whether or not  it would be as good the second time around as my last stay was exceptional and more than great. The Taj Palace in Mumbai never fails to disappoint and always exceeds expectations. The hotel is one of the finest world class hotels I have ever stayed in  anywhere and is a place that dreams are made of. The rooms in the hotel are well appointed,luxurious and rich with history.You feel as if you are stepping back into a forgotten time of luxury ,pampering and service that is uncommon today even at some of the best other luxury  5 star plus hotels in the world.Great furnishings,bedding and amenities. Beautiful to have breakfast and coffee overlooking the"
"Beauty of TAJ can't be described in words, one have to experience the same. WAH TAJ WAH. hospitality and location was awesome. TAJ MAHAL PALCE Mumbai is an heritage property celebrating 112 years of Glory. we are proud of TAJ."
We were treated like Royalty. Genuinly not experienced service like it anywhwhere else. You haven't lived untill you have spent 24 hours in the Taj in Mumbai. Thank you very much for an incredible time
our experience was the best ever.  nothing was too much trouble and felt that we were looked after to such a high standard.  it made me feel like royalty.  one night we had our meal in our room and was brought silver service by a wonderful waiter.   the selection of food was out of this world and world class cuisine.   i would certainly come here again to be looked after.
"Loved our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace. We were upgraded, which was very much appreciated. Would suggest to anybody to book the palace rather than the modern tower. Beautiful place. Perfect service. We enjoyed the service in the lounge, by the pool and in the breakfast room. The rooms were well appointed and spotless and house keeping did a fabulous job."
"I am frequent resident of Taj but this stay at Taj was not upto my expectation. We usually prefer Taj because the kind of hospitality and homeliness we feel in Taj properties is incomparable to any other hotel, may it be oberoi or sheraton or Shangrila etc. But this time right from the entry point i.e. reception to checking out of hotel, the warmth and hospitality which usually present in Taj's staff was completely missing. Waiting at reception for check-in without any proper response, long queue for breakfast, asking chargeability for water bottles in addition to  2 bottles of 500 ml, asking for toiletries again and again, same repetitive menu in shamiana restaurant fix two soups, three vegetable limited variety of desert are some of the examples which pressed us to think that"
"We wanted to go away for the Independence day weekend, but didn't have enough time to plan. So we just checked into the Taj Mahal Hotel for 2 nights. After the unfortunate bombings, this was our first visit and stay and we were in the refurbished section where the rooms and people had been gutted down. Everything seemed as beautiful and intact!  The best thing about this hotel is it's location. You look outside the window to get the sea and Gateway of India view. You walk down a few steps and reach Starbucks. You walk a few more steps and you can get lost in the Colaba Causeway shopping.   Breakfast is another attraction. The spread is huge and it's difficult to do justice to it! The Chinese place, Golden Dragon, has great food, though the other Taj property at Bandra has a"
Everything you expect!  Great standard of service and wonderful location make this a perfect place to relax after the hectic pace of the city.  Expensive but sometimes it's worth treating yourself to a little extra luxury and you'll get it here.
"In a few words - simply the best !!! We booked a Club room which included a limousine transfer from the airport (essential in Mumbai), breakfast, high tea, cocktails and Brandy and Chocolates in the evening. A choice of excellent restaurants, fully equipped room with sea view overlooking the Gateway to India and Egyptian cotton sheets and fully stocked mini bar. Beautiful architecture and best of all fantastic staff who make you feel that that you are the most important guest they have at whatever tariff you are paying. A wonderful experience and fully recommended you will not be disappointed but not cheap but great value for money. ""you tend to get what you pay for in this world"""
"I had stayed at many top hotels over the past decades, including the best hotels in the Gulf region, such as the Burj Al Arab and the Emirates Palace. But our brief stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel constituted the most amazing hotel experience I ever had in terms of comfort and the quality of services, as well as the location. I will remember for for the rest of my life the view from our hotel window on the Gateway to India and the Indian Ocean below. Better yet, I will come back again!"
"We stopped by to drink martinis at the bar. They were very good, I was drinking Vodka Martinis but the others were on Bombay Blazers- a delicious and very sophisticated drink.  The staff looked after us very well and the clientele in the bar were fun and interesting. a good place for people watching."
"Having traveled all over India for the past twenty years, and staying in virtually every Taj Hotel there, this particular hotel stands out as ""the jewel in the crown"" in every respect--breatdth of services, unique design, variety of top-notch on-premises restaurants, and cleanliness.  The hotel holds its own among the great hotels of the world."
Beautiful hotel right on the water. The room was absolutely beautiful and I loved roaming the halls - the entire hotel is just incredible. Breakfast and high tea were very good. I highly recommend staying here.
I have comeback to this hotel over the last twenty years and they have always been fantastic. Their recovery from the terroristic attacks has been spectacular and i am relieved that this iconic hotel goes on providing excellent service. A keeper.
"It smells wonderful, the staff are extremely gracious and efficient, the pillows are sumptuous, the food is delicious, the pool area is a true oasis of calm in the midst of the Mumbai madness, the Palace Sea View rooms are fabulous and the hotel itself truly lives up to its iconic status."
"The Experience of the stay at The Taj Mahal Palace is really excellent and awsome,The Location of the Hoel is very good asit is just infront of The Gatewayof India and Sea facing. The Senario in the very early morning and at evening is really awsome .I recommend all to stay atleast once with this wounderful hotel to have a excellent experience."
"Fantastic end to a fantastic holiday. We spent our final night in India at the Taj and enjoyed every minute of it. Staff were attentive and helpful, room was well appointed with every modern convenience."
"My wife and I spent three days at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai - first time in India.  Great experience, great hotel and excellent and friendly service.  Location is good for exploring Mumbai.  Stayed at ""Palace Wing"" - which is more expensive - but worth it."
A good hotel but not quite up there with the best in terms of value for money. The location is excellent and there are a number of charming shops near by.  The hotel has a great pool and very helpful and friendly staff. If possible try and get a room which has a sea view.
"This hotel is beyond comparison probably the best hotel in the world. The scent, the rooms, the staff and the atmosphere, not to mention the History that sits in the walls of this fantastic institution is really worth your money ( even though costly) Even if you can afford only one night, it is worth it."
"This grand hotel remains excellent despite the years; Always nice to be at a place where we see familiar faces, they all seem to age as gracefully as the hotel. Great concierge services (they  always seem to find bookings in the best places in Bombay!); Sea Lounge is a must everyday for breakfast. What a way to see the sun rise over the bay! excellent rooms and service. A sure bet next time in Mumbai."
"Whenever we go to Mumbai, to stay there, or pass through en route to London, we always stop at The Taj Mahal Palace. This hotel has managed to retain the very best of old world colonial atmosphere accompanied by truly outstanding attention to detail and polite, courteous, unobtrusive service. Nothing is too much for the obliging staff whether in the great restaurants, the room or public areas. Just Perfect"
"I can't really find any fault with Taj Palace. We stayed in the Palace wing, and our experience was simply wonderful. The hotel is absolutely beautiful - historic but modernised. The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. However, it's the service that really impresses it. Staff seemed to divine our every need before we even asked. We particularly enjoyed hanging out in the pool area, which provides a lovely oasis with respite from hectic Mumbai. The food served at the pool is also excellent.  Although the palace wing is on the expensive side, I don't think you can find better anywhere for the price.   As a tip, we would recommend requesting either an upper floor in the tower or a room in the palace wing looking over the pool, as those seem to offer the quietest options"
"The hotel is good, very old and rustic feel compared to most modern state of the art hotels Bit on the expensive side, but service is great and very little is not done to make you happy. Good hotel will definitely try them again the next time i am in India."
"Staff was overly obsequious, eating facilities were less than excellent and service was slow, good location; lots of restaurants in the area.   Prefer the Oberoi as a luxury hotel.  Understand the need for security but it seems somewhat haphazard."
"This hotel is, by any comparison, the best hotel in the world in my opinion. I stay at high end hotels for abt 100-120 days a year world wide, and there is no other hotel I can name that has the feel, the aura, the service, and the overall quality as The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai."
"it is always a great & proud moment for us to stay at Taj palace the decor, hospitality, food has been excellent & consistent  for no of years .we stayed for one night at palace & were given royal treatment at palace.Breakfast at shamiana was awesome with wide variety we had to skipp lunch.one must not leave without having food at wasabi."
"A magnificent Heritage , Host to many legends . an experience to cherish of yester years Grandeur. Sea Facing view rooms only recommended , The best morning sunrise view from the same. Good dining experience  at the souk"
"Amagin place want to stay again  and again. I am enjoying in this places with my friends. feel Like royalty, out of the world experience great heritage value.  A prime central position overlooking the Arabian Sea and the Gateway to India.Their staff is unbelievably attentive, every one of them (and there are many staff). "
"An unforgettable experience, even though we were cominmg back again for a repeat visit, charm, splendour, heritage and class all resound and you still feel like at home with the fantastic staff. Thank you."
"After many years of coming to Bombay/ Mumbai I once wanted to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace after hearing and reading so many fantastic things about this hotel. Our stay certainly lived up to most of our expectations. Due to high occupancy around new year we stayed in a standard room in the 'new' wing. The rooms were very clean and housekeeping really took great care everyday. The room itself is rather big but kept very simple and not very modern. I can imagine, that the rooms in the old building are much more spectacular!  The service we received was very good. Compared to european standards slower but very helpful and warmhearted.  On the negative side is to say, that the reception staff is not as friendly and motivated as I would have expected in such a prestigious hotel. On"
"A beautiful, historic hotel with amazing views and excellent location.  Pool lacks enough lounge chairs and cabanas but the air quality in the city is so poor swimming is not enticing anyway.  Service was 5 star level except for poolside dining"
"From the moment you arrive you are almost overwhelmed by the level of service. Everyone greets you politely, nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel like royalty. Do not miss the daily tour at 5 of the old hotel. It was conducted with humour, professionalism and it is free as well. If you ca n afford it, stay in the old section which is full of wonderful photos, historic rooms and an atmosphere that is much better than the new wing. However, the new wing is more than adequate, being quiet and comfortable and good value."
Nothing seems to be a problem.  Every time a smile and greetings with a grin. Flowers and a birthday Cake for my wife  Breakfast galore Large spacious rooms . Staying in the palace side on the 6th floor was incredible.  View's fantastic  The only disappointment was the restaurant on the ground floor called Masala craft where the food was not up to their standard.  Compromise was we were not charged when this was pointed out.  Highly recommend and will be back next time.
"Stayed for one night on a Mumbai stopover.  Pro's - Good downtown location, near sights and nice area to walk around  - very clean, nice rooms - great breakfast, with very friendly and helpful staff  Con's - the check-in was a bit chaotic and of a hassle. They wanted to be friendly and ushered us away from the counter to a lounge area. The promised coffee never came and the check-in took rather long. The luggage also got mixed up. Would be better to have a no-nonsense, but faster check-in. - lobby was too busy and noisy for our liking  "
"I was a solo traveller that stayed for one night (it was nice to get a free upgrade on arrival). I have also been staying at some of the other Taj Hotels, so was already a fan. A great hotel with class and history. True first class experience from being checked in to being shown to room by my personal guide.  Beautiful room, luxurious...marble everywhere, beautiful things and paintings. Quiet room with harbour view.  There are two distinctive parts to the hotel, the palace (original) and the tower the newer part.  Plenty of choice of restaurants. Great Spa. Plenty of high end designer shops if you are into that.  Plenty to do on your door step once you step out. The area is very well developed (European standards) plenty of nice restaurants and shops nearby, as well as the"
"What distinguishes the Taj is the service. Their staff is unbelievably attentive, every one of them (and there are many staff). In particular, I would like to point out the Sea Lounge manager, Mr. Pradeep Singh. On day 2 (of a 4 day stay), he remembered us when we arrived for breakfast and then, directed us to our ""favorite"" table. The fact that Mr. Singh remembered us at New Year's (when the hotel was full) impressed us. This is what makes you feel special."
"feel Like royalty,  out of the world experience great heritage value.  Never miss the heritage walk....  A hotel that rules the heart of  personalities & common man the dream come true.  Loved the sea facing room.  Would like to thank Anant Mishra @ Shamiyana; Gaurav @ Front Desk, Satish @ Concierge Mala @ the pastry shop."
"Taj made my birthday party and stay so memorable. The hospitality, rooms, food everything is at such an exceptional level that nothing else comes close! Now every city that I travel to I wonder if they have a Taj. Thank you so much!"
"Our four night holiday in Bombay was wonderful and made even more special by our stay at the Taj and their staff. We would highly recommend this hotel if you're looking to enjoy the city.  Everything from the service, restaurants, pool and general location were superb."
"From the minute we arrived until we left every single bit of our Taj experience made us feel special.  Always smiling and ready to help staff. Delicious food, with a choice in cuisines. Amazing view not only from our room -observing  India getaway- but as well from roof top restaurant or just sitting in lobby or pool area allows you to admire the decor. Small room treats on turndowns - like spa treatments, rose petals. Definitely coming back when next time visiting Mumbai"
"In 2016, mom and me decided to fulfill our long time desire of staying at the majestic Taj Mahal Palace. It was not just a dream come true but an experience which will always be cherished as a treasured memory. The hotel is breathtaking. We stayed in the palace wing. The hotel staff is courteous and friendly.  Based on our previous experiences , we held the notion that the bigger the hotel, food is worse. Well Taj finally broke the notion. We really enjoyed their food preparations. Thank you Taj, for making our 2016 have an amazing start."
"I pride myself that i have given good service in any restaurant, hotel etc i have run in 40yrs and i have stayed and worked un some of the best. This place made me feel humble every member of staff from reception to waiters to housekeeping were pleasant helpful and so willing. A special thanks to chauffeur Santosh who gave us a guided tour of Mumbai he was brilliant and our butler Rakeesh who would do anything for you sublime. The palace rooms are terrific definately the place to say. Service beyond parallel to many more exclusive english hotels where you feel that they are doing you a favour in allowing you to stay there. If l could give the Taj 10 stars i would a very memorable stay am gushing a bit to much no not really not enough. "
"We stayed at the actual palace rather than the Tower as wanted to get a feel of the heritage and it didn't disappoint. Very efficient staff and I was thoroughly impressed with one of them when he realized that we are from Kenya-he actually greeted us in Swahili!   I was very dissatisfied that I couldn't get a nice cup of ""chai"" as it was the Taj but the matka yoghurt was delicious. They had a good spread for breakfast.   It's in a good location with The Gateway of India across the road and lots of hip restaurants in the vicinity. Got to see South Mumbai in a very different view. "
"Horrible food, Lazy service, treated like just any other person without any sense of the luxury. Restaurant service at Shamiana was horrible. Souk is most of the times closed. New year event at the Ball Room was pathetic with zero service and overcrowded without any planning and arrangements."
"1)Every thing was nice except miscommunication about complementary facilities applicable for my package. 2)My rooms was already booked,next day again got the mail, we do't have the room. We are not in position to book the same. No alignment found between various booking channel."
This hotel continuously lives up to its hype - it is just the most amazing place to stay in Mumbai. We had a room facing Gateway of India - what I liked the most is that the rooms seemed to have retained its character and not become too modern with its furnishings etc. The hotel itself is just pure class and the staff and management are the best you could ever wish for. Each person from Hotel Manager to the Bell Boy greets you personally and you just want to keep coming back here.
A luxury hotel with excellent service. Nice room. Beautiful garden with a large pool. Very good gym. Good and good breakfast included. The two dinners we ate in the garden restaurant did not meet the price.
"As we didn't specify non smoking rooms for our stay, we were greeted by a foul smelling room and corridors on our level.   When we discussed this with the duty manager, action was taken immediately. We were upgraded to a gorgeous room in the heritage wing.   Superb facilities and immaculate staff.   Breakfast was amazing!  "
"My stay at the Taj Mumbai was incredible.  The service  impeccable.  The staff's attention to detail was amazing.  The hotel décor, cleanliness and amenities were exceptional, but it was the staff who really made the visit ""over the top"".  Whatever I mentioned, even if not a direct request, they provided.  I was sick and without my asking, a humidifier and Vicks vapor rub appeared in my room...along with two bouquets of flowers and a pillow stating ""get well"".    A MUST:  If you stay in the hotel, you must book for the Palace Building.  Do NOT stay in the Towers, that is a whole different ballgame and liken to a normal hotel - no point in staying at the Taj in the Tower Wing.  I had a three room suite which was amazing, but you can also get smaller sizes.  The three bedroom"
"The perfect hotel I sincerely believe. The Golden Dragon Chinese restaurant and the Wasaabi Japanese restaurant are excellent and it is great when you have restaurants of this level within the hotel.  The rooms are well thought with spacious bathrooms and well laid out and attention to detail with snacks, fruit platters and tea/coffee facilities within the room.  The highlight of the hotel has to be the staff! We were spoilt rotten and I would definitely go back very soon."
"Supposedly one of the highlights on our culinary tour of India and often compared with the Savoy. Our experience was far from it. The staff were poor, the service chaotic with sandwiches being served after scones. No plates to eat off and several requests for water and tea ignored with Beauty, one of the waitresses, who clearly wasn't happy when we complained and moaned at one of her colleagues. A real disappointment! You certainly don't need to bother going here until the GM sorts the staff out or trains them! Only good point was Larry the pianist who was the one professional in the hotel experience we loved! Such a shame! "
"We booked a night at the Taj to save the drive home after having a meal at the Taj's Japanese restaurant. Despite my guest changing his travel dates at the last minute the Taj was more than happy to alter my reservation on on the day without cost, it really did feel like nothing would be an issue there and post visit I can say that is how they do it at the Taj.  When we arrived by way of an apology for keeping us waiting during checkin our room was upgraded to a magnificent suite in the old part of the hotel (you have to stay in this part not the tower wing) that was bigger than my first apartment!  Everything at the hotel from the service to the attention to detail in the room was fantastic and we only wish we could have stayed longer.  The meal at the Japanese restaurant, all"
My second time i stayed at this iconic hotel; typical Taj hospitality and efficiency.Cuisine to suit all types of palates on offer. The location of the hotel in Colaba area allows easy access to the KalaGoda chowk and Colaba Causeway. Also a great place if one wants to get away for a day to Alibaug or Revdanda by ferry from the Gateway and then again get  back into Mumbai at the Taj. Iconic places like the Leopold Cafe are just five minutes walk away.
"We booked in the tower but were upgraded to the palace with a sea view.  Checked in early and checked out late for no extra fee.  The service was fantastic and the room brilliant.  The housekeepers added sunglasses cleaning clothes, bookmarks to our guidebooks etc.  Well worth every penny - thank you"
"We stayed at the Taj over New Year. The hotel was very busy but apart from the lack of sunbeds round the pool it was just lovely. The staff were great. It was our wedding anniversary while we were there and our room was decorated with balloons, flowers and a huge chocolate cake was waiting for us.  The hotel has managed to retain it`s old world charm and is furnished in a beautiful traditional style while offering all modern conveniences. For a special occasion where a little romance is required this hotel is perfect. A great location too."
"Awsome! Who ever comes to Mumbai he/she visits this hotel ones. It has all things from spa to multi cusine restaurants like- ZODIAC GRILL, SEA LOUNGE etc. It also gives the view of GATE WAY OF INDIA. It is the best place for 31st New Year Party. birthday_cakewrapped_giftChristmas_treeparty_popperpine_decorationclinking_beer_mugsbeer_mugtropical_drinkwine_glasshot_beverageshortcakedoughnut"
I have stayed at many top hotels around the world but the attention to detail here was just spot on in my opinion unbeatable.  A hotel for anyone looking to be pampered in the most opulence surroundings a must visit.
"First of if you're going to stay here I'd highly recommend a Palace room preferably going for the full Club Room experience.  The rooms a delightful and of course you get the history with it too.   The staff are all first class and the little 'details' are lovely.  these range from a glasses cloth placed by your glasses case to, in the case of my young son, being given a WWE jigsaw (housekeeping had obviously seen the WWE annual he had on his bedside table) - they've certainly gained another generation customer there!  All the food we had was faultless and breakfast is a gem.  There's all the standard 'western' fare (done better than most of even the best hotels in the UK) along with some great Indian additions e.g. Parsi eggs, idli etc and of course they're happy to take an"
"The flagship hotel standing stately opposite the Gateway of India and defining the coastline of Mumbai will humble you with it's discreet service and personal touches.  Taj Mahal Palace really knows how to 'care' for its guests and make them feel wonderfully looked after - just the way one would be at home.  The space and the rooms themselves are fabulous and world class standards. One wouldn't even expect them to be otherwise, but it is all the little touches that made the difference.    The refreshing lemonade quietly left in the room post a work-out, my laptop and other gadget wires all neatly coiled and  taped together with velcro, the staff at Shamiana knowing on the second day how I like my coffee and knowing I'm in a rush, giving it to me in a take-away glass are just a"
"Everything in this hotel is great, it's indeed luxury hotel with terrific service. It's a heritage hotel with long history behind. Beautiful interiors.   Great pool area. Restaurants are the best in India but you need to book in advance.  Location is great, you can not find better- close to the sightseeings, opposite the gate of India from where you can catch a boat to Elephant caves.  We were really impressed by the hotel."
"This is one of the most breathtaking hotels I have been too. So much history; some good, some bad..A drink in the Bar is a must as is the buffet breakfast; you are most certainly attended to as royalty."
Excellent hotel Good Staff Room are Good nice food good cleanness  Nice Location we received good rate from Taj Hotel every hotel of Taj was very good my memory with always this hotel when i return mumbai i want again stay in this hotel
"The Taj Hotel is the most fantastic building, its a bit of an institution. The service is organised chaos, its a massive hotel, but out of the chaos the staff seem to know everybody's name.. no idea how they do this!  The food was great when we ate at Wasabi on the first night, but on the second night at Masala Kraft it all when a little below average. (It was NYE, so we'll put it down to been a crazy night in the hotel) They did knock this off the bill.  The Breakfast and Lunch's were excellent.   If you're in Mumbai you have to stay/ visit the Taj Hotel.   One down side is they lost one of our daughter toys, which naturally caused a few issues. However they didn't really do anything to solve this problem! A little bit annoying."
"Me and my partner traveled from goa to mumbai just for this hotel . It was a dream of ours to stay here but we were so disappointed   .  What the hotel fails to advertise is next to the amazing main hotel it a high rise block of flats ... this is where we stayed, the standard of which was no better than a 40pound a night travel lodge .  The hotel grounds are amazing and everything we could have imagined but the hotel room was less than average . .. not at all what you would think for such a grand hotel   . I also believe that as we stayed in this part of the hotel that the staff behaved differently to us , an example of this was that once we we shown to the room the staff member asked if that was all, I asked if we could order a bottle of wine (it was needed after the"
"one of the best hotels we have stayed in. I had booked this hotel for my husbands 50th birthday and we were not disappointed, everything from reception, to breakfast, to the restaurants was magnificent. Excellent service and staff. Urmi the manageress of Wasabi looked after us so well, we felt like royalty from all the staff at the Taj,would definitely return again."
Thank you so much it was a wonderful stay and I will be returning. Love this hotel and it is a fun place to stay. I am not sure what else to say to fill this character minimum lets hope this does the trick.
"An absolutely stunning hotel in an amazing city!  We stayed for 4 nights just before Christmas in a room in the Palace wing; and had a fantastic time in every respect.  Right from the point of arrival, everything about the hotel is first class.  One thing I would definitely recommend however, is to treat yourself to a room in the Palace Wing - while I am sure that the Tower rooms are also great, the Tower is really a rather unlovely 70s tower block add-on so if you are staying in such an amazing hotel, spending the bit extra to stay in the historic part is really worthwhile.  The central staircase and the corridors to the rooms are simply spectacular in the Palace Wing and it just adds an amazing feel of history and occasion to your stay!!  The pool area and the outside"
A must visit hotel for people who love heritage sites. This hotel provides experience of rich heritage with modern amenities. The location is crowded and traffic is pretty bad around the hotel. The bar at the hotel is classy and food quality is very good. It is not the typical 5-star hotel which you expect!!
We booked 3 rooms for a family stay-cation at the Taj. Palace wing is gorgeous. Staff was lovely. Food was good. Hotel was over crowded due to some weddings and new years but service was not compromised in any way. Highly reco'ed
"The service is impeccable- the rooms are clean, large and very comfortable and the breakfast is wonderful, but this hotel is busy.   Being a tourist destination in itself makes the lobby feel crowded and chaotic, combine that with the size of the hotel and the number of guests it holds and you have a very busy hotel.  The amenities just are not quite sufficient to keep up with this.  There is no ability to lounge in the lobby, the restaurants are quite full and the pool is a busy place.  This is wonderful for a flavour of India, but not if you want a restful experience, so really, it just depends on your desire.  If you want a beautiful stay in a historic building with wonderful service in a convenient location and like to be in the action, this is your hotel; if you want a more"
"Location: This hotel is located at the Gateway of India. This hotel is Iconic, one of the oldest hotels, yet modern and has its own class. You would feel the vibrance of this hotel in the lobby itself.  Staff: Very friendly and would ensure you have a great experience  Rooms: Nice and clean. The rooms in the tower wings are small.  Food: Multiple restaurants located inside the hotel that offer variety of cuisine."
"This isn't really a hotel, it's a glam movie, populated with international travelers in all manner of indigenous costumes, speaking a UN range of languages, with a staff  magically intelligent. The restaurants are scary good. The bars are infinitely perfect. The spa is ridiculously just as it should be. Stayed in a corner suite in the palace part of the hotel. I wouldn't recommend the high-rise tower rooms."
"Would highly recommend if visiting Mumbai.Good food,drinks and rooms! Fantastic service,staff wonderful,especially around the swimming pool!! Hotel tour excellent. Tips if visiting-diet Coke in hotel £2.50,shop just outside 30p,big savings for a family of seven over five days. Local Pizza Express and Subway a five minute walk and a welcome find. Use the hotel to book tours,fantastic company's.Don't pre book before arriving,as it's a lot more expensive and plenty of availability at short notice. Harbour bar has Happy hour daily 5-8 pm,excellent cocktails!! Thank you to all the staff who are so eager to help and please!!  "
"Opulent experience in luxurious colonial style surroundings.  Faultless service from welcoming staff. Suites in the original building have beautiful wooden floors and beautiful marble bathrooms.  Nice touches everywhere with flowers, tea in the room, etc. Probably the most luxurious hotel and pampering experience ever."
"great hotel, thinking about everything, we came with 3 children and we have games for them at the room it was great.  thank u for everything, the breakfast also was great, the pool was wonderful. so thank u thank"
"Our stay was to celebrate a special event. The staff made everything absolutely perfect. Going the extra mile to treat us like true VIPs. The room, facilities and staff could not have better and we would recommend this hotel to anyone."
"We looked at photos before we went to Mumbai and wondered if this was really the best hotel in Mumbai.   It is.  Sure the St. Regis and Four Seasons are newer and have flashy skyscraper rooftop bars where the glitterati hang out, but that's up the suburbs away from the actual city and the real culture of the place.  The Taj is the original and the best for anyone who wants to get a sense of old world Mumbai in first class style. A fantastic hotel."
The palace is located right opposite to Gateway of India.  We spent good couple of hours and had lunch here. The food was amazing and service was little slow. Staff was extremely professional and overall experience was great.
"It was the best service I have ever experienced in a hotel, from checkin to the daily staff u meet, all have that extra enthusiasm to be the best in what they do. I feel the Taj Mahal palace is way better than other hotel like the Taj Boston & the Taj colombo and Bentota. Really happy and lucky to get the room upgraded from tower wing to heritage wing for all the 3 rooms we occupied. The breakfast was very wide with variety and the egg Benedict was face_savoring_foodface_savoring_food. Will I return to this hotel again, definitely and have already thought about Christmas 2016. Hope to c the Taj again very soon."
"It is one of the best hotel in Mumbai , Its a great Monument of Mumbai we all proud of it and suggest every one to visit this place once, i had great experience , i was past working in one of the Pharmacy there in campus"
"Good. The Ma'm accompaying me while I checked in told that my credit card will be blocked for Rs. 10,000.But, at the end I knew that, it was not blocked. I presume that she lied, which is not acceptable behaviour."
We checked in at the Taj Mahal Hotel  Palace  on a second stay after .....fifteen Years. What a change! First thing we noticed was  the minutious  security check. We felt more  comfortable  reassured as we were hesitant on our choice of hotel taking into account the tragedy that occured some years back.we  reached at 6 am much earlier than Normal checking time.We were tired and needed sleep.  We were nicely  surprised when  the reception staff immediately  arranged for a rest room with shower for us. We felt very much at home.The staff are very  polite and ensure that guests feel at home. We enjoyed  a buffer breakfast with a an array of food from continental to Indian or european food.... so much choice. Well we have been spoilt with so many goodies in our room. We have lived
"Spent 3 nights here. Excellent location and view. Staff are polite. Stayed in room 707,abit outdated bathroom - hope that's gonna be upgraded as well.  In dining was sumptuous. Will definitely stay there again.  "
"Superb hotel in great location overlooking the bay.  Friendly staff, great food and beautiful rooms.  Excellent restaurant and private guest bar with afternoon snacks for residents. Spacious lobby.  Interesting shops."
"Stayed recently at The Taj Mahal Palace.  Very very very very good hotel, had a wonderful stay.  Everybody is very polite and best of the services.  Wow is the word.  Spent two nights and had a memorable stay."
"The taj is excellent hotel that provided my family and i with a sun lounging pool, a great view from the room of the gateway of India and a great selection of restaurants and bars in and out of the hotel. Staff were attentive and welcoming, they booked our taxis and did our online flight check in. A really great hotel for couples, families and groups."
The beauty and majestic presence is so over whelming. I had to keep reminding myself that I really was there. The symmetry and detail is difficult to comprehend because it is a work of genius. We went early morning to avoid the crowds which was a good move. We went back later in the day to catch sunset but the smog overpowered the effect.  A gorgeous once in a lifetime experience.
"We had a brilliant room overlooking India Gate when the navy were performing their gate ceremony? This fabulous hotel must be one of the jewels of India. The food , the staff and the location were all outstanding."
"It was absolutely fantastic experience staying at Taj. They take utmost care of their guests and make sure they guests are always happy. They made our anniversary extra special. They had arranged for a cake. But they surprised us with room decoration all with balloons, flowers, bouquets. I cant thank the staff enough for this amazing surprise and gesture."
Stayed here recently for three nights. The hotel is beautiful and in a great location. Has been open for over 100 years now. Many dining options within the property. The staff are fantastic and no request was a problem. Highly recommend a visit. The sea lounge is particularly wonderful for an afternoon drink or light meal.
"This hotel is consistently excellent - the staff are outstanding in anticipating and satisfying one's requirements. I have  returned regularly for many years, and even though there are more modern hotels in the city, I would always prefer to be at this one.  The facilities are great, with a good choice of restaurants, and a beautiful pool area and excellent spa."
"Fantastic hotel.     Grand, efficient , lovely staff.    Fantastic beds.      Pool area is lovely - but pool not heated - just too large I guess.     Breakfast was fantastic.      Great location.    Would recommend to anyone.  Drinks and restaurants expensive.   Nice shops also.   Staying in colonial section was best.   New tower is not a bad second option. Loved it."
"I reserved a room last minute via the website and notified them that it was my daughter's 15th birthday. When we arrived, less than 24 hours later, the room was decorated with balloons and roses. They also brought in a birthday cake and chai. My daughter felt so special and it was an experience both of us will remember forever. Thanks for creating such a great memory.  Outside of the birthday surprise, the hotel smelled amazing and the room was a welcome vacation from our vacation. After roughing it around India for 10 days, we pampered ourselves on our last night, and it was the perfect end to a once-in-a-lifetime trip."
"Picked us up at the airport at 4am and welcomed us to the hotel with a nice cup of tea.  Went on ""the early morning Mumbai tour"" that started at 5:15am.  Fantastic and highly recommend.  Rest of the service and stay was great. We are coming back in a month."
"Our first Visit to India & we couldn't have stayed anywhere better. Extremely friendly & efficient staff.  Very Good International Buffet breakfast, plenty of choice for our eight day visit. Excellent Location with good restaurants & shopping within walking distance."
"- Welcome: The welcome from the hotel staff was exceptional. The hotel has a certain degree of ambiance and beauty.When you enter the hotel, you sense that the old world charm of the days of The Maharajah meets the needs of a modern world. There really is no fault to this hotel,"
"I am not sure how they do it, but this hotel has achieved perfection in every aspect. The service, the food, the ambience, the little surprises we found in our room... everything was just perfect.   The experience started off from the airport pickup where the chauffeur was so courteous. When I arrived at the hotel I was greeted and shown to my room and did not have to go check in myself.   Compliments to the chefs in the hotel. Every dish we had was amazing. "
From the time that we walked in until we left for the airport the hospitality and service provided by this hotel was world class.  The hotel itself being a landmark was a definite highlight and the impeccable standard of this hotel is fantastic.  The staff are the friendliest I have experienced at a hotel and they are willing to help with anything to make the stay more pleasurable or simply provide a welcoming smile.  The breakfast buffet was phenomenal with pretty much anything you could think of on offer.  The pool facilities were also wonderful and the extra touches in the room made our stay unforgettable.  I would highly recommend a stay at the Taj to make any trip to Mumbai special.
"Shabby, outdated, damaged, damp smelling rooms.  Average (at best) service.   Nice breakfast albeit very slow inattentive service for items not on buffet.   Charged £45 for 2 days of wifi on check out. After picking up our jaws from the desk and asking for the manager, the rude lady refused to remove the charge and explained that it was our fault for selecting the 'premium package'...a complete disgrace...after sternly explaining how unhappy we were, they reluctantly removed the charge. £300 for two nights and they still want to charge £45 for the privilege of having broadband internet.   Last but not least; there were building works going on directly outside our window and building going up and down the outside. This made things slightly awkward when my we were getting changed."
"I don't know much about the history but I think this is the oldest five/seven star hotel of Mumbai ,situated just across Gate Way of India ,The hotel is having old wing stay in old wing with long balconies and super services .WiFi was super fast ,daily they gives complimentary fresh fruits,and one thing do not ask any staff about the 26/11 incident ,that is sad story and they do not want to discuss about that. Check in and check out was very smooth and include breakfast in your tariff as it is super in Shamianya the ground floor restaurant.Ask them for Sea view room"
" Staying at the Taj is a exceptional and unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived in a chauffeur driven hotel car and the warm welcome that was awaiting us on arrival we could not have wanted for more.  Our room, in the older part of the hotel in the palace wing, was very impressive and extremely comfortable. The hotel's facilities are generally excellent, there are plenty of comfortable lounges and a wide variety of restaurants that cater for all tastes. There is also a beautiful spa that offers steam and sauna rooms, a gym and a range of therapies. A wonderful pool that sits in the old courtyard of the hotel surrounded by lush gardens. The tour of the hotel starts a five pm every evening from the palace wing reception, will appraise you of the hotels history and is"
It has only improved consistently since my first visit here 50 years ago. Have stayed here many a times and may be a little biased in my assessment. The service and attention to details is what makes it one of my favorite hotels. You are guided to your room when you arrive and all details explained. Regular Rooms can feel small but articulate in its finishes. We had a superior room. Beds are very comfortable and all luxuries are included including Breakfast and free wi-fi.  All what may expect from a luxury hotel including personal attention is afforded by a very diligent staff members.
There is nothing you can complain about this hotel. It has history the best location in Mumbai and lives up to the standards you would expect from a luxury hotel. Do not miss the daily tour of the hotel to find out some interesting details.
"All the staff are very friendly & professional. Staff are keeping smile & offer the best hospitality. Very clean at all the facilities. Despite very busy hotel, but be quiet in the room. Cuisine is very delicious and make the food in not so long. Laundry is so well done with care."
"We did not stay here but visited for afternoon tea which was superb.  We had seats by the window with fantastic views of the harbour and Gateway to India.  The food is buffet style but the waiters kept bringing us plates of goodies until we were absolutely bursting, could not eat anything else for the rest of the day.  Particularly good was the street food which I particularly wanted to try and the desserts were out of this world.  There is also a formidable list of included teas and coffees!  Afternoon tea is excellent value at around £35 for two people inclusive of taxes and service charge, would highly recommend it."
Not many hotels can boast about the efficiency of the staff in all outlets. Extremely friendly and polite and helpful in all matters. the hotel has its own charm and makes you feel a VIP from the day you check in. The buffet breakfast is well spread out and meets your taste buds in every which way.
"We were shocked, in the best possible way, when we entered the place. And it became better and better all the time. The hotel is absolutely great! So elegant, so clean so unbelievable. We spent a weekend in a dream!"
"One of the best hospitality we have ever experienced...  My wife and me selected Taj Mahal Palace Hotel for our first wedding anniversary and the decision was absolutely right.   From the time we come out from the airport, the hotel staff have shown utmost generosity and care.  We arrived early morning and the room was full ready for our arrival with all our special requests. We stayed for 5 days. We highly appreciated the extremely friendly, helpful and professional staff s in Taj Mahal Hotel.    The Breakfast in Shamiana Restaurant was delicious; all staff was very much helpful and pleasant.  Masala Kraft and The Souk were other Restaurants with great tasting food and very good service. (Never had a chance to try other restaurants)  On every vacation trip the accommodation has"
"I stayed here as a single female tourist and have never been made to feel so welcome and at home. Where do I start the hotel is stunning inside and out a real piece of history. What makes this hotel though is the staff, everyone from check in through to the restaurant staff are wonderful, they make u feel like a regular or even family right from the start. The travel desk work wonders on helping you. I absolutely loved my stay here it was at the end of 4 weeks in India and what a way to end my holiday. I can't wait to come back and I will. Come to Mumbai if only to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace it a very special place indeed. "
"When in Mumbai, and can afford, Taj is the ultimate experience of great Indian Hertiage well prserved.  Great property, great staff, excellent food, immaculate service !  Taj is an experience others emulate to reach. Location, luxury and the aura is amazing !!!"
Stayed at this property on numerous occasions and this weeks stay was no exception - just superb.  Stay in the heritage wing.  Eat at Golden Dragon or Wasabi.  Avoid Masala Kraft - very disappointing.  Sea Lounge is consistent.
"Taj Mahal Palace has absolutely beautiful common areas and generally good staff.  However, the room was very small and dated.  Our ""king"" bed was two twins pushed together, with separate sheeting on the two.  The room and bathroom were small.  The shower lacked a proper plastic curtain, which meant either flooding the room or angling the water awkwardly at the side wall.  Wifi was slow.  Overall, not worth the hype and cost."
"We arrived from the UK after a long flight. It has always been on my bucket list to stay in the Taj Mumbai after backpacking in India in 2001. The hotel was amazing, staff are fantastic. We arrived and were taken for a cold fruit juice and then got checked in from our room, no standing about. The hotel pool is such an oasis from the crazy outside world in Colaba. They sent a gift of jigsaw and teddy to our room for my 5 year old daughter which she loved. The rooms are beautiful and all of the staff say hello. The breakfast was absolutely fab and the views over looking India Gate was beautiful. We did not want to check out. Can not recommend this beautiful hotel enough, completely in awe and is without a doubt my favorite hotel in India. Thank you Taj, can not wait to come back."
"Right from the entry to checkin to getting into room to food to checkout, the entire stay at this hotel is an experience in itself that everyone should experience. When in Mumbai for business or leisure don't think twice just say Wah Taj by staying here....  Truly, an iconic hotel that despite over 100 years is Luxury at its best"
"We had our best hotel experience to date at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. We really appreciated the extremely friendly and professional staff who did everything possible for us before and during our stay.   We were delighted that they upgraded us to one of their suites, which had an amazing view of the Gateway of India and the sea. It is hard to believe that this kind of service still exists. We highly recommend staying at this most wonderful hotel. It has been an amazing experience."
"We arrived at Taj Mahal Palace after backpacking around India for three weeks.  Naturally we were exhausted from this.  The hotel provided us with an extremely clean and pleasant environment to relax.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  The rooms were clean and spacious, we spent many hours by the swimming pool amazed how nice this hotel was.  Would defiantly recommend, a lovely treat."
"My husband and I stayed there on our honeymoon and it was the perfect place to be! The staff was helpful and warm, the hotel is beautiful and clean and the food was divine. We stayed at a number of 5 star hotels during our visit around India and the Taj was by far our favorite. I recommend getting a room overlooking the water. Fun fact: there is a hotel tour at 5PM that is a lot of fun."
"We had our best hotel experience to date at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. We really appreciated the extremely friendly and professional staff who did everything possible for us before and during our stay.   As it was our anniversary, we were delighted that they upgraded us to one of their suites, which had an amazing view of the Gateway of India and the sea.  They went above and beyond our expectations, decorating the room with 3 rose arrangements and rose petals.  Later, during our first evening in the suite they surprised us with a cake that they made especially for us for the occasion!!   It is hard to believe that this kind of service still exists.  Truly, we do not have the words to fully express our gratitude for their most gracious service.  We highly recommend staying at"
Impeccable service and amazing hotel in the heart of Mumbai. No reason to stay anywhere else. We stayed in the old building which is beautiful and stunning. The staff were excellent. We had an amazing experience.
I visited the Taj Mahal hotel after the Mumbai Attacks and believe me the place has matured. You will not feel that it was a victim of such an incident. The view from the hotel is spectacular. It has everything you can wish for. A sea facing room added to the experience.
"I stay there with my partner a few times. We stayed in the original part of building and it was fairly nice. I like this place but I like Taj Lands End in Bandra more.  They have nice restaurant like Wasabi, Golden Dragon and also have Sea Lounge serving various tea. But I didn't really enjoy their food. In Taj lands end, There is a restaurant named Masala Bay serving best Indian food in Mumbai. And Atrium Lounge in Taj Lands End serves Kopi Luwak which is not available in Taj mahal palace.  Moreover Taj mahal palace is not friendly to Taj membership guests. I tried to use coupon I've got from member team but they don't really reply me back, and gave me hard time. I couldn't use it at all.  I can tell you Taj Mahal Palace is nice but Taj Lands End is better."
"My husband and I spent our last 2 nights in India at the Taj Mahal Palace. We were treated like royalty, with a private check-in, and escort to our upgraded room in the old section. This is the most beautiful hotel we have stayed in, from the lobbies, restaurants, pool, and the royal treatment."
"we didn't stay at the hotel but having lunch here is quite the experience since it also allows you to explore this mesmerizing hotel. The food and presentation was excellent, as was the service. Wandering down the hallways you see totally amazing things, including displays of famous visitors, President Obama being among them. The lobby is nothing short of breathtaking and or lunch room offered views of the harbor and the Gateway Arch (just a few walking minutes away). As you may recall, this hotel came under attack in Nov. of 2008 by Islamic Militants based in Pakistan; 6 explosions ripped through this hotel. The attacks extended way beyond this one and was covered world wide at the time. "
"amazing hotel , friendly staff amazing location  with sea view and India gateway view full services with best price I will return back  for this hotel,this hotel for is the best hotel I had expert ever."
People here are amazing - friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is similar to other hotels in terms of amenities. But the staff makes it different and makes it an amazing experience. Always available to help and guide you with a smile.
"staying was a nice experience except for the feedback described above. The nicest courtesy at walks of the Hotel, interactions with the staff and officers of the hotel and attending to the customer. I would like to repeat my stay whenever in Mumbai and suggest to friends and relatives accordingly but never to give credit card no. in advance."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is like no other, nothing comes close to the Excellence on every level.  The Opulence left us breathless.  The Staff were extremely professional, and very courteous at all times.  We spent 7 glorious nights at The Taj, and will visit again real soon.  Our trip was booked with BA.Com, with a 7 nights stay including Breakfast.  However, when we arrived, we were checked in by two Beautiful Ladies to be told that we were being upgraded to their Premier Room overlooking The Gateway of India.  This included lots of complimentary additions which was very welcome, and we were very grateful. The Food was excellent in all of their Restaurants, and if something was not on the Menu, it was ordered for us by the chef on our next visit.  Breakfast was a whole experience"
"We stayed in the Palace wing, bay view, for 4 nights, arriving after a 24 hour travel day. We were welcomed warmly, and checked in at our room (privately, not at reception ) . Activity in front of the hotel takes place all day and night, including boats and ferries. The view as exquisite. The hotel was totally refurbished 8 years ago and every detail was done superbly. And it has been well maintained since. Butler service was attentive. The many restaurants offered a variety of excellent cuisines. And the breakfast buffets were the best we have seen in India over a two week trip. The hotel is still preoccupied with the events of 8 years ago and it was a bit disconcerting to think about what may have happened in our room. Security into and in the hotel was excellent. "
Stayed here for 4 nights and paid extremely high prices. Pool only had seats for Whites and even the Indian pool boy wanted nothing to do with Indians  Staff was very attentive except the concierge which were once again looking after White customers.
"My husband and I stayed at the Taj just one night… but we wish we could have stayed longer. It is the best hotel in Mumbai, without question. It is the perfect starting point for a short vacation in Mumbai as you are right in the center of the historic district. We got a room with a view of the Gate, and it was magical. I highly recommend to have high tea in the hotel, as it is a decadent experience, and one I will remember for a long time. Also, drinks by the pool at sunset… If you are considering going there, do it, you will not regret it. We hope to stay at the Taj soon again."
Staying in a palace in the heart of a metropolis sounds fancy enough but that was only the beginning. Add a sea view room and some extra-ordinary hospitality and you will have what staying at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai feels like. The Breakfast was not as great as everything else but that apart it was a fantastic experience.
"Checkin is a problem. Helpful & Courteous Team Members Neat & Clean Hotel Nice Ambiance Slow in room service & Housekeeping  Departure is Fast  Also, there is delay in the room service facility and the housekeeping. Although team is very courtiers and helpful and I specially like Priyanka who gifted some toys to my son and clicked a photo at the reception. I spent some good moments but it could have been better if at the initial stage things has been taken care of properly."
Amazing value with regards to room rate including gourmet breakfast buffet for a 5 star property.  I have been to some very high end places all over the world. This old elegance and impeccable service. Highly recommend.
An ideal first stop to relax a really beautiful Hotel staff very attentive making your stay memorable. Our  room was very comfortable.The pool area was good can be a little noisey depending on the traffic outside Thoroughly enjoyed our stay
"Had a terrible experience at the Taj. We booked in Jan 15 expecting great service for our honeymoon. The hotel lost our booking, we had to chase them and chase them. Then they tried to charge us the maximum rate but but us in a lesser room. On arrival the room was so dirty I had to ask for pieces of furniture to be changed. They didn't put any of the special request I asked for, simple things, in the room. Then the bath filled with what looked like sewage to me, although the hotel promised that it wasn't. Which made me worry about what we showered in. My partner has been ill, ill since! All in all they ruined the start of our honeymoon."
A great experience to spend time in one of the greatest hotels in the world! The room and en-suite were beyond criticism; The service was excellent but always discreet and available if called for; The Concierge had the answer to every possible question or request; The in-hotel restaurants are world-class; The ambiance was peaceful and relaxing. Only criticism? The stay was over too soon.
"Oh wow! what a fantastic stay we have just had at this hotel. This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in and were so lucky to have been upgraded to the Old Wing. Our room was just perfect with a great view of The Gateway of India.  We loved the electric mirror in the bathroom, never seen that before, so was good to put on the tv whilst cleaning your teeth. The staff are friendly and can not do enough for you. The breakfast is a lavish affair with so much choice. We ate in the Indian restaurant and the Rooftop Lebanese restaurant. The food in both was excellent. The pool area is a relaxing place, and was just what we needed after 10 days in various tiger reserves. We had a great time watching the practice for Navy Day from our bedroom window, the helicopters came really"
"I feel as if I have entered a different world, a better one, at the Taj. I leave feeling refreshed and somehow a better person because all the refined, elegant and thoughtful treatment at the Taj is trandformative. It is my idea of a perfect place to stay, dine, and rest."
"I always wanted to stay in this hotel and finally I spent my birthday there. I went there to celebrate my birthday. I must say, this hotel has a great property and that too in a great location. View of Gateway of India from Taj can never be compared with anything. Hotel staffs are really caring . The moment we reached at hotel, we came to know that our room has been upgraded from Tower Wing to Taj Mahal Palace, without any extra cost. I was very excited that time but that doesn't last for more than 10 mins. Hahaha!!! We got a city view room in Palace and the view was not at all good. Anyway , I don't blame them for that. Rooms are well furnished and comfortable .We had lunch in Shamiana and dinner in Golden Dragon. Both restaurants have world class ambiance and served really"
"Amazing hotel, Amazing location, Amazing food, Amazing tour, Amazing attention to detail. Forget the Four Seasons and the Mandarin Oriental. This takes it to a different level. Security was incredibly polite and amazing too."
"What can I say.  Of all the hotels I have ever stayed in, and there have been many, this is probably the best.  I stayed twice between trips to other Indian cities for some social events.  I know Mumbai and the hotel well but had never stayed there before.  Everything about the experience was good.  Firstly, for both stays I was ungraded to the heritage wing.  There seemed to be some renovations going on in the tower which may explain why I was diverted to the lovely old part of the hotel but whatever the reason I was thrilled.  The check in experience is managed in a way to make you feel like a special guest and all other encounters with staff are handled the same way.    On both occasions the rooms were lovely.  Lots of marble in the bathroom, careful touches like an"
We were at the property to spend our first night after our wedding... The property was brilliant .... Epitome of luxury but what made this property even more special was the staff and the service they provided we celebrated our wedding first night there and their team made sure everything was so well set up  I'd like to mention their guest relation manager Priyanka and Zena who went out of their way to make this one of the most memorable experiences  Everyone at the hotel was so positive that it was infectious  We also were given an inside tour of the hotel which was wow  
"I have always wanted to stay here and glad we did. However first morning we could not get into the nearest restaurant, Sea Lounge, for breakfast and has to cross the hotel and go up a tower to another cafe where one was not clear what food was available and service for very poor. We ate three breakfasts, two lunches and one dinner here during our stay and while food was excellent service could have been better for this class hotel."
"My girlfriend and I had the most incredible time at the hotel, the service was impeccable and the rooms were immaculate. The breakfast is delicious and we recommend staying in the main old hotel in order to experience the authenticity. We wished we could have stayed for longer but it was worth every single penny. "
"I was there for a representitation from one of the company in Spain . The Hotel is beautiful and very serius Hotel but very nice I saw the rooms and they are big and confort , the food in our metting from the Hotel was also very good you have of course spicy and you can get also not spicy ,also the área I thing it is one of the good places."
"We arrived in Mumbai after 3 weeks in India staying at both Taj and Oberoi properties. This was our absolute worst experience. Check in was rushed and rude. We were not allocated the room we had booked and basically had to lump it. apparently we had booked a special room that included free drinks at happy hr, free afternoon tea and free cognac and chocolate at the end of the evening. No one bothered to tell us this we just happened to find out on the last evening when  we were having our mini bar checked and the young man who was doing this told us. I agree with previous reviews re trying to have your deposit refunded. I paid my bill in full and was told my money was being ""held by a bank and it would take 14 days to refund "" I, of course protested as this is an absolute joke"
"Just wanted to say thank you to Taj for their amazing guest services staff.   They made my fiance & I's stay so memorable. After not being together for 7 months, I surprised her for her birthday with a night in Taj in the Palace wing - she has always spoken about staying there.   Upon contacting Taj they went over & above. Balloons, Roses, Cake and a nice photo collage with poem greeted us when we arrived in the room.   Their service made our stay so much more memorable that I just had to share the experience and say thank you."
"super best servise is excellent , this hotel is india 's best .room is best , securty is strong but best , may fevrt is taj hotel , my fist vizit to hotei , location is propar , value best , staff is very best"
"A different kind of high tea where you help yourself to an Indian style buffet tea on top of being served with sandwiches, scones, clotted cream and jam. Service was second to none with different kind of tea's and coffee's being offered. You won't leave wanting more as there's plenty of food!  Thoroughly enjoyed the experience with the added bonus of a window view of India Gate. Definitely recommend."
The hotel is flawless in terms of quality of the accommodation and service.  They fulfill every request and anticipate your needs.  I have traveled a lot and this was the best hotel experience I have ever had.  It is expensive but you will NOT be disappointed.
"The rooms are beautiful, the staff very helpful and efficient in carrying out their normal ""functions"", the food is very good and the location fabulous.   So why am I rating the TMP one atar? Because of the inability of its staff, from reception staff to deputy managers to deputy catering manager to the general manager of the hotel itself to respond to and deal with a customer problem/complaint.   The hotel staff advised me that a jacket or tie was required to dine at the Zodiac Grill, which has a ""formal"" dress code. So I bought a jacket, as I didnt have one. I was pretty much the only person wearing a jacket. When I complained to the reception that had phoned to check the dress code, I asked them to escalate as I wanted to know what management were going to do about this. Two"
"We had an amazing experience here. We were here to celebrate my birthday and our late honeymoon (we called it this as it was expensive and treat and used honeymoon money gifted to us to afford it). We told the Taj and the magic started. They upgraded us to a suite, they filled our room with balloons, a cake, flowers, foot soaks and a rose petal bath. Such a nice treat.  The afternoon tea, cocktail hours were fun but too tempting. We had to skip dinner we were so full.   The service is friendly and formal and not too full on.   The decor and surrounds are amazing. One of the nicest pools I have ever slept in.   Value- it is expensive if you want to do club level and in the palace wing, but totally something I would do again. "
"Stayed here in November when visiting friends. They had arranged for a stay in the Palace wing that is totally incomparable with any other hotel that we have used all over the world. The service in the rooms, bar area and restaurant are second to none."
"We (wife and me) traveled to Mumbai to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We had booked a Harbour view room in the Tower wing. Once we reached there, the room allotted to us did not have a harbour view. Payal at the front desk called us and offered us a free upgrade to the Palace wing. Thank you Payal, that made our trip extra special. The hotel is superbly maintained, to say the least. The staff at the hotel was very courteous; and they looked after us really really well. Breakfast was an absolute delight, even here we could experience the staff courtesy. The place can get very crowded and yet the staff will pay attention to each and every table. They came and talked to us and made us feel so welcome. You really feel pampered all through your stay here. There are a number of"
"An excellent  hotel in magnificent surroundings, providing an  exceptional level of service. Staff are attentive to the needs of their guests whilst respecting their privacy. The quality of the food is excellent, especially breakfast. Can also recommend the high tea."
We loved our stay here. The beds were super comfy and the breakfast buffet was wonderful - especially after travelling throughout India! The staff were helpful and always there when you needed them. This is an expensive hotel but worth every cent!
"i have been with my family there, amazing experience from historical legacy ..to warm hospitality all was simply amazing. staff was too courteous and sensible they took extra car to ensure our sty remains most memorable thank you taj to make this a cherishing experience"
"Hotel Taj you cannot describe in words, it is best everyone must experience once value of TATA brand ,fantastic location ,best service, good food, clean rooms, warm welcome very helpful staff, and on top of that heritage building of Hotel and surrounding,"
"Rarely will you be exposed to a hotel experience to match the Taj in Mumbai. It is without question an exceptional experience in elegance, history, luxury and matched by a superb line of services that are sincere, helpful and at no time an intrusion. It is a wonderful experience from the moment you pass through the revolving doors until your luggage is assembled and packed into a waiting car or taxi."
"This was a business trip and so unfortunately I didn't get time to use many of the facilities at this wonderful hotel...from the moment I stepped into this hotel, the staff treated me like a Maharani....I was first given a ""Heritage"" room which is in the original hotel built in 1903...my goodness it was fabulous! Elegantly furnished to a high standard with marble bathroom and a separate large bath......my second trip back was in a ""Tower"" room (part of hotel built in 70's) which wasn't as spacious nor as opulent....however, comfortable. Breakfast within the Tower suites was served on the top floor (19th?) floor and you got a breath taking view of the Gateway to India....(see pic) With regret, I didn't get a chance to really take in all of this lovely hotel......I would love to"
"I arrived almost midnight, my room is not ready but the staff take care us by provided access to the lounge for waiting. Taj upgrade our room and breafast at the Sea Lounge is just perfect to see the gateaway india and delicious food"
Taj Mahal Palace is a great place to stay for one to two nights. They excel in their ability to arrange for cars and other amenities; although restaurant service leaves some room for improvement. The food is great; location great - across from the Gateway of India. This is a good place to stay!
"Wow ! This hotel is so luxurious and beautiful that is hard to describe in words...  Is the perfect place to visit while in Mumbai . Is offering a very strong contract of Mumbai its self!  You can have a very nice dinner over there , with perfect service but I must say the prices are a bit overrated...!"
Really good service and food. Beautiful Pool area.  We stayed in a club room and I can really recommend. Great complimentary afternoon tea and evening drinks and snacks. Great to have a view of the Gateway. Free evening tour of the hotel well worth doing.
"In over 30 years of business travel, I cannot remember a better level of service in a hotel.  The staff were extremely friendly without being obsequious, the service was efficient without being intrusive.  Other firms (not only hotels) should send their executive to see what good service really is.  It is a large hotel but feels like a boutique.   Rooms 10/10 and the food was outstanding especillay recommend the Souk for Middle Eastern food"
"We checked into the heritage wing of Taj. The sheer entry into the heritage wing is like you are into some palace. The rooms are awesome, courteous staff is another plus.  It was my daughters birthday and we decided to go to Masala Craft. I have been to this place in past but this time it was a complete turnaround. From serious, snobby and arrogant staff from my previous experience, this place had a 180 degree change. All smiling and very courteous staff. They not only celebrated my princess birthday but all the staff including kitchen staf and head chef  had come to wish my daughter! Not just her but everyone in our family's day was made. It was a pleasure stay!   I would love to visit it again! "
We had seen the TV programme in the UK about this hotel and were keen to stay in it. It was a wonderful experience. We stayed in the old palace part.  It is the most beautiful building and we never tired of looking round and admiring it. We wanted to see the ballroom and a member of staff kindly took us round to show it to us. The staff were kind and helpful. We arrived late in the evening after a long and delayed flight. We were tired and needed to have some dinner and a drink. It was all a bit confusing and we were so grateful for the understanding help and advice given by Rahul Singh in the Club Lounge. We saw him several times afterwards during our stay and he went out of his way to make us feel welcome. Breakfast in the Sea Lounge was wonderful with views of the Arabian Sea
"I have been around the world but this experience was an amazing one. It is hard to explain how professional it is run but in simple words: I felt as if I am the ""KING"" and each and every one of the staff treated me as if they were the owners of the hotel trying to please me in any possible way."
"We decided to splurge and stay at the Taj at the end of our recent tour / holiday to India , staying in the Palace part of the hotel .We are so glad that we did ! We really do recommend staying in the Palace over the Tower if you can stretch to it , from what we saw its a very different experience . The hotel is amazing - the detail applied to absolutely everything from the cleanliness , staff appearance and service is superb . As others say the amazing staff seem to know what you want before you do anticipating everything ! The hotel is an oasis of calm after the madness of Mumbai and literally as soon as you exit the hotel and cross the road to the Gateway To India you are absorbed into the melay ! The hotel is a very short walk to the famous Leopold Café ( worth visiting for"
In last week of November I had visited Mumbai to do bulk booking of rooms and Banqueting. Since I wanted to celebrate Anniversary of my parents. I stayed at Trident Nariman Point and really There are no words to express the happiness that they gave me and on one evening I visited Taj Palace Mumbai to see as another option if liked but I was surprised to see sad and mourning faces of security staff and reception staff at hotel. I felt like 24/11 Terrorist attacks are still fresh in the minds of staff working at Taj palace. The hotel people think everyone who enters the property are terrorists and when I wanted some information from reception for every enquiry there was answer as NO. The Attitude of staff is very arrogant and discouraging in nature. Finally I decided to cancel the
"the huge Mahal surrounding with the Indian Ocean and Gateway of India. Really great view from inside and outside both.I've been there with my mother,we really enjoyed the lunch.its a royal place to stay there. Wonderful!!!!!!!!"
"The best hotel I have ever stayed at, a truly beautiful hotel very clean and spectacular views! With lots of food verity to choose to eat and shops to browse if you need anything, pool spa and facilities it's hard to go out!  Highly recommended !"
"I will never return to Taj Mumbai. In spite of settling bill upon departure, I have received a call saying that, my bill was outstanding. I need to sent my bank statement as a proof to verify that, I have paid my bill. Very disappointed with service quality."
My wife and myself stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary; all I can say is the experience was truly amazing and the hotel nor the staff can be faulted in any way at all. They have impeccable attention to detail and make the experience very personalised. I will most definitely be staying at this hotel again in the future.
Spent 3 nights at this stunning icon. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the original part ( not the Tower) and had a view over the pool. An amazing oasis to come back to after very hot days playing tourist. Being next to the Gateway of India was a plus with all the central historic locations of the Raj nearby. Safe walking locally as well. The staff were exemplary . Warm and accommodating with all requests. The choice of restaurants makes it easy to stay in house. The pool and pool area are divine. Once again sooo welcome after a long hot day. Go for it and treat yourselves!!!
A throw back in time and truly exquisite. The foyer on first entering is unbelievable and breath-taking as are the views from the rooms overlooking the water. Afternoon Tea and Breakfast were especially memorable in superb elegant surroundings. The service was exceptional. This is one  special and remarkable hotel that lives on in the memory.
"Cannot praise enough! Staff, location and facilities are amazing. We stayed there 4 nights and enjoyed every moment from spa to food. Excellent. We were even given the recipe for our favourite dish. Pool area is wonderful and staff could not do enough for us. We will stay there again!"
"We we're warmly welcomed & taken straight to our room. Not the biggest but with a great view. We took drinks in the club room which was a beautiful old room & visited it a few times over our stay.   We ate in Souk restaurant the first night & thought the food was excellent & fresh tasting. We tried Indian wine & it was really enjoyable. Breakfast was nice with lots of choice.  The second night we ate in Masala Kraft, lovely food shame the decor doesn't quite match it, rather bistro in style.   The pool area is stunning, we even sat out at night, the hotel from the back looks beautiful lit up.  Overall attentive & kind staff. Good cocktails too! Worth the visit. "
"I surprised my wife with a weekend break in the Taj Mahal Palace for her birthday, the whole experience from arrival to departure was excellent, the staff were extremely hospitable, the food out of this world and the pool was a joy. We will certainly be back."
"We booked after seeing the TV series and were not disappointed.  Breakfast selection extensive and service exceptional, total pampering. House keeping do an amazing job must visit the bedroom several times a day with little touches. Our only regret was we booked for two nights only and wished we had stayed a lot longer. Incredibly expensive to eat in if you are on a budget but lots of places to eat locally. The pool is wonderful at 6.30am gives you an appetite for breakfast, not that we need any excuse."
"There are 5 star hotels and then there is the Taj Mahal Palace. Nestled seaside in Mumbai, It's ambiance is royal in a way only a true palace can be. The security is tight getting in and that gave me a feeling of comfort knowing its troubled history. Our sea view suite had a private butler and fresh flowers and treats every day. The grounds were not expansive, but luxurious in that every chair and lounge was plush with the finest details. The pool looks at the posterior view of the hotel and has an old grandiosity that takes your breath away. Looking up at the towers there are always a hand full of Ravens flying around adding to that mystical feeling of being back in time or  living in another life.The executive lounge features a posh afternoon tea as well as evening snacks and"
"It felt like I was stepping back in time, to when people really knew how to treat guests, everyone greeted you with a smile and genuine pleasure to see you.   To be taken straight to your room was a delight and bypass all the usual check in procedure. It was an honour and a pleasure to have been to the Taj"
After23 years we decided to visit Mumbai to celebrate my birthday . Taj mahal palace was the best choice 20 years ago and in my opinion it is still the best in Mumbai . We booked two rooms one was for us through the booking.com another room was for some guests  booked by calling the Taj reservation office.both were perfect and up to our expectations . The prices are excellent as we have booked two different room categories . We also booked 4 different rides through the concierge service and they were perfect . Airport pickup by a Jaguar with an english speaking chauffeur who gave us information about the places we drove buy . A Toyota 4wheel took us on a 4 hours tour around the city with a very nice and knowledgeable chauffeur. As we were celebrating a birthday the hotel were so
"It is the most pleasant and fascinating hotel with great hospitality offered during each and every visit !  In addition to the physical outstanding facilities provided this hotel : TAJ Palace has the most talented staff who are truly well mannered and highly efficient in serving the guest....it is always a memorable visit !   i shall return back to soon...in fact on 1st January, 2016 with the Chief Rabbi from United Kingdom !!!

If you come to Mumbai and stay in this area you have to stay here.  It's just so grand am sure it hasn't changed in 100 years (apart from air con maybe). We were lucky enough to be in the Palace wing and if you can stretch your budget then absolutely do so you can stay here.  We didn't see the newer Tower rooms but you would certainly lose some of the experience if you didn't stay in the older Palace wings. Just steps away from the Gateway to India and right on the sea front its a perfect location to explore this side of the city.  Took us an hour in a pre paid black and yellow cab from the airport (INR 700) and about the same back using Uber (via the Sea Link) but this was at a weekend.  Could take a lot longer am sure. Breakfast was lovely and was served in a few places but we
"Taj Mahal Mumbai is excellent hotel, iconic pace in entire city, true experience of India and superb service. positioned in historical Mumbai gives you opportunity to explore the main sights of Mumbai in mater of couple of hours,  I recommentd this hotel, business or leisure will fit to any type of visitors...."
"Obviously it goes without saying that staying at this hotel will be an unparalleled experience for guests.  The other reviews and reputation speaks for itself;  I just wanted to write a quick review to call out some exceptional service provided by Pradeep S., Manager of the Sea Lounge.  Pradeep and his staff went out of their way to ensure we had a marvelous experience during breakfast and High Tea at the Sea Lounge.  Great times!  Also, you have to try Morimoto!"
"To be sure, its hard to beat the Taj Mahal Palace for an amazing hotel experience.  From the airport pick up, hotel entrance greeting, registration in the room (no waiting at the front desk) and personalized service we were blown away with the sincere caring and concern for guest services.   Even though we took the least price room , we were treated like royalty. Restaurant food was amazing and reasonable priced for a hotel of this class.   The Concierge was truly a professional. My wife wanted to by saffron and asked for advice. He went out of his way and had a hotel driver go and pick up his recommendation and had it delivered to our room.    Without doubt, its the place to stay and such a great location near shops and the famous Gate of India. To be sure, its a bucket list"
"We visit india regularly since 2004. Our stay at the Taj Mahal Mumbai Palace is one of the highlights of these trips. Excellent service, superb rooms, lovely outdoor terrace with huge swimming pool, quality food in the various restaurants, and prime location in the most desirable shopping area.   We have never been disappointed, and each time we notice new improvements to make our stay ever more satisfying."
"Everything about our stay in this iconic hotel was outstanding - beautiful rooms in the Palace wing, exceptional service, great restaurants and bars. The staff could not do enough to help, and the location made it easy to walk to many of the major attractions. It was a delightful stay at a wonderful hotel."
"there is nothing to dislike really good old fashioned standards with 1st class service , if i had to look for a complaint it would be drink prices but then it is same with other 4/5 star hotel prices in mumbai , just seems strange a double gin and tonic equals a days wage for a person in mumbai but thats india !!"
"If possible try staying in the older part of the building, it is fabulous, and beyond comparrison. The staff go out of their ways to help you, but then this is what you are paying for. Even if you do not stay at the Taj a visit is well recommended. The resteraunts are brilliant and the staff make you feel special."
It's the Taj Mahal... enough said! :) A trip to India must include a visit to this magnificent building! One of those rare sites that exceed your expectations. Worth going with a GOOD local guide to explain the history for those of us who aren't history buffs. 
The original Taj Mahal Palace is a destination in itself. One can rest from the hurly burly of intoxicating but exhausting Mumbai.  Elegant rooms and the graceful manners of the staff contribute to the true pleasure of staying here. It must be said that it is essential to book into the traditional part of the hotel as the new tower is bland in comparison.
"Never got reply no for any requirement we had. Top level service.  Good food, Options, Good quality housekeeping. Must have an experience with Taj. In future also will definitely stay.   Value for Money."
"Booked the hotel with huge expectations but sadly they were not met completely, The rooms were quite small. The best part was the location and the view from the room of Gateway of India. But apart from that there is nothing to carry home about. The buffet breakfast was good and well laid out but that was given thing due to the brand of Taj. But I feel overall the hotel did not provide the Value for Money."
"This was my first time stay at The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai with family. We were welcomed with 'Tilak' and 'Tulsi Mala'. The check-in was quick and we got complimentary juice after enter the room. It was the most wonderful stay I have ever had anywhere in the India. Everything about the hotel was beautiful, elegant and wonderfully presented. Stayed in a Tower room in 18th Floor, overlooking The Gateway of India and Arabian Sea. Sunset and sunrise absolutely stunning! Every day at 5 pm there is a 45 min tour of the hotel definitely not to be missed. Staff were all amazing and really friendly. Will definitely recommend to anyone traveling to Mumbai for life time experience. Pricey and worth visiting if u are fan of legacy."
"Stayed recently for one night and was definitely impressed with the interiors and ambiance. I was in the palace wing, so definitely the design and architecture was impressive. Room was nice and spacious and the food was also good. The only negative was the initial impression at the time of check-in which took almost one hour. We were not being informed about any such delay but the staff could have handled this better as we did not see any queue at the counter and even though we were seated in the lounge, the whole process was very time taking especially for the sequential check-in for the four of us. And the wifi network was also very bad, but the other good things kind of compensated for that."
"I suggest to avoid the CLUB section of the hotel. No worth it.  Chose a room with breakfast included instead.  Also if you can, go out for diner and lunch and avoid drinks, over priced.  Also very crowded.  If you look for intimacy and privacy not the place.  That being said if you have lot of money to spend for not much and the pleasure to say that you stayd in the famous landmark, no problem go for it.  There is other TAJ much better then this one."
"There's nothing original to be said about the famous Taj Mahal Palace. We'd been looking forward to staying there for the last few nights of a holiday in India. It's a superbly maintained institution, with a well-deserved reputation for customer service and attention to detail.  We stayed in the Tower, rather than the historic original building, and while the rooms here are comfortable enough, they don't offer particularly good value. They're on the small side, and the bathrooms seem particularly cramped.  Our room, one of the Tower’s top storeys, had a commanding view of the Gateway of India monument and the sea beyond.   In-room facilities are perfectly adequate. and while the daily cleaning routine is faultless, it’s not always carried out early enough. The WiFi signal was"
"Thank you for your hospitality at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.  I had one of the most memorable experiences at the hotel.  Having breakfast at the Sea Lounge and being pampered by Mr. Pradeep Singh serving us on a daily basis Indian Breakfast and having every day a new breakfast experience.  Also Mr. Pradeep wants to make sure that everything is available and comfortable while we are having breakfast.  Furthermore the housekeeping manager puts a few touches in the room like flowers that makes us enjoy coming back to the room.  Moreover the driver at the Taj Hotel, Razak, was very friendly and pleasant.   What made the hotel really stand out are the pleasant shops within the hotel that made us feel part of the country and not tourists and especially Joy Shoes.  Joy Shoes shop go"
"We stayed for three nights and me and my fiancé have never felt as spoiled as we did during that time. At arrival we were upgraded for free to a suit in the palace wing where you get floor butlers. Our butlers where Rahul and Adrian and if I ever get rich enough to hire a butler, these guys would be on the wish list because of their excellent manors and helpfulness. The breakfast is in a class of its own and served by very kind people. We ate at the Masala Kraft, one of the many restaurants and it was an food orgasm. This is a place you miss from the moment you leave and you want to go back. It is worth every penny!"
"the new wing is hopeless. no sound proof window!!!! when will they renovate fully this wing?   concerning the old wing, a bit over priced. but service is good indeed.   we took the club rate, giving the use of the club bar. cosy and excellent service."
"Worth every penny.. All the services were par excellence. From check in to check out. Didn't have any issue.. They upgraded our rooms for no extra charge.. From the newly renovated rooms and bathrooms to the hotel facility, We had no issues in service and thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
"The five star property is associated with the spirit of Mumbai as much as it is about the quality of the fine diners and eaters. From the tea room to the expensive paintings gracing its walls, the Taj Mahal Palace is one of the landmarks of modern India. The view of the Gateway of India from the rooms is fantastic as is the services. Nothing to say on the amenities except that they are top notch."
"It's the best hotel I've stayed in. Grand, iconic, with wonderfully helpful staff.   After a while in a city like this one, it's wonderful to be able to escape from the bustle and heat, and step into the cool comfort of the Taj, with all its facilities.   This story illustrates how good they are. Without realising, I left my iphone at the security check. Somehow, the security staff traced me, and delivered it to my room."
"After watching Hotel India on the BBC me and my family wanted to see the property for ourselves. Unfortunately we arrived pretty late in the evening, however the staff were very helpful. We had dinner at the Indian restaurant at the hotel where the food was amazing and super yummy!  What made my trip to this hotel wa meeting Indrani at the reception and she is so humble. "
Got an opportunity to stay at one of the finest places of the Taj group  couple of years ago..fantastic Hospitality...great food in room service as well as the shamiana restaurant. Good ambience. Well maintained rooms..butler service at each floor..
I've always wanted to stay here since first visiting India in 1979. So after a 2 week trip to Rajasthan we decided to relax for a couple of days in Mumbai and the Taj Palace seemed the obvious place.  Its certainly different and in many ways unique; the staff smile and say hello and the check in was painless even at midnight. We were also upgraded from the tower room we had booked to a heritage deluxe in the main hotel - fantastic. The morning view of the sunrise over the Gateway of India was worth the room cost alone.  Food was fine - buffet breakfast but freshly cooked eggs and certainly no complaints about the quality. Snack lunch was fine otherwise we ate out.  Concierge services very helpful in advising how to spend our 2 days and in making bookings.  Clientele seemed to be
excellent service heaven location and superb positive vibrant liked very much. Its also nice when you go out from hotel as it is facing sea side really feels very good. do not MISS  to see CST  V T STATION  AFTER SUN SET. Can also reach movie theaters in very little time. so enjoy
"Upon arrival I was faced with an unusual dilemma an upgrade to the Palace accommodation or keep our tower room on the 3rd floor with an amazing view of the harbour and Mumbai Gate from the balcony. What a great decision to have to make. It was the Palace room and we weren't disappointed the level of service was exceptional even my slippers were laid out on a mat beside the bed during the evening. The swimming pool was beautiful with complimentary fruit kebabs and water and staff came to spray mist on our faces. A unique experience. All this before enjoying the wonderful location close to all tourist destinations, as well as museums and art galleries not mentioned in our guide books"
"No other hotel can give an intrinsic satisfaction that TAJ can provide. It was luxurious, grand, beautiful, majestic. One goes back to history with the Historic walk. The staff is extremely courteous as they themselves feel proud of working at this hotel. When you have so much pride and history attached to a place the experience has to be magnificent."
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Taj Mahal Palace - I was expecting excellent service and the hotel lived up to my expectations.  I tried really delicious Indian food and was delighted by he High Tea in the Sea Lounge - offered tempting tidbits by the staff I ate 'street food' from Mumbai and in the Marsala Craft restaurant I had a 'tiffin' that was simply delicious.  Everyone was kind - going that extra 'mile' to make sure my first visit to India went well.
"I've recently come back from India after a 6night stay in Mumbai at the Taj Palace followed by a short stay in Jaipur.   We arrived around 8am on a Friday and the hotel by 9am organised an early check in. I cannot begin to say how immaculate the service was during our stay from the timely deliveries of orders, to arranging a reliable blouse tailor, taxis and even customised meals in addition to the fantastic breakfast buffet- I owe the young lady Ritika a special mention for looking after us so well every morning at breakfast. She had ""nihari"" and ""paya"" made for me on special request. On top of this, the light dinners of dhaal and rice I ordered for my 2year old on a number of evenings was provided complimentary by the hotel chef. Oh, and how can I forget the lemon refreshments"
"As a 68-year-old seasoned traveller I experienced the best hotel experience of my life at the Taj Mahal Palace this November. ""Ask and you will receive"" seemed to be their motto and by interacting nicely with the staff my wife and I had the most polite and perfect service we have ever known. Beyond memorable."
It was a very good experience and Taj made our stay so special. They take care of you so well. The heritage tour in evening is must. The rooms at palace was too good. Feels like royalty. One should look forward for staying here
"I stayed in the Towers (new wing) i=on a business trip. The Hotel looks regal and is well  maintained. The overall service levels are very good, though there could be more consistency. Spacious rooms, fabulous view and fantastic food. As my stay was brief, I cannot generalize my experiences, but the Taj continues to be a stately and ageless property."
it was a excellent experience. the Taj hotel is a one of the best i can say. the ambience is superb. i was really enjoyed the stay. also looking for more visits to Taj.i really experienced the diffrence in Hospitality of TAJ  n other hotels.
its one of the oldest and most exuberant luxury hotel in Mumbai. the old palace wing is not comparable with the new tower. the old wing which is claimed to be haunted is beautifully done and if you have an eye for  things you would appreciate minute details for more info the in house residence of old wing can join free walking tour which takes place every day 5:00pm in hotel lobby.  the only thing which i would say they can improve is the breakfast spread.
"The place was very comfortable and staff very professional  and helpful. The food ,specially the breakfast was excellent Was slightly concerned about the security ,but the  security at the hotel made me feel comfortable"
"Brought my company VP and the head of several European companies here for meetings in Mumbai.  I invited everyone for drinks at the hotel bar, but we were refused service because my VP was wearing sandals.  We were all in collared shirts, jackets and slacks (no shorts) and the sandals in questions were fashionable leather ones, not flip-flops.  Humiliated doesn;t begin to describe how I felt when I had to make other plans and take everyone out of the hotel for drinks."
"My favorite place is this place and my favorite part of the stay is the in house restaurant shamiana,  the pudina prawns are my favorite and I keep visiting this place for this food. The ambience,  the service the staff are best in its class."
"The Taj certainly lived up to its billing, what and excellent stay. We wanted to stay in the Taj but given the stay in Mumbai was part of a tour of Southern India we did not splash out on a room in the original hotel but were accommodated in the Tower Wing.  We certainly did not feel second class citizens and we had the most wonderful view over the bay and the Gateway to India, plus a lovely room.  Breakfast was excellent and the staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. We ate one evening at the Indian  restaurant and the food was superb. We used the pool throughout our stay and what lovely environment this was as it was around the area adjacent to the pool for drinks and a meal.  A top class hotel and an outstanding welcome to Southern India. "
Imposing hotel with third rate and indifferent customer service. No one is bothered once you check-in and it seems the hotel's servicing has gone down- right to the point of not acknowledging the birthday of a checking-in Inner Circle Gold member! Completely spoiled my birthday experience. Not a patch on Oberoi service and absolutely no value for money.
The finest hotel in the city that provided royal treatment to its guests - starting from arrival till departure. Enjoyed the heritage tour that of the hotel which sounds quite patriotic. The staff are very cordial and pleasant smile makes your day. Enjoyed the dining too and wished if the facility can be extended out there. Overall an excellent stay that we enjoyed.
"I had business on the other end of the city (BKC district), but I could not go to Mumbai without staying at this iconic and historic hotel. I was not disappointed. Indian luxury hotels pride themselves with their top notch service standards, but the Taj exceeds even these standards. I was particularly impressed with the driver who drove me back and forth to the airport: he went out of his way to accommodate the stop I needed to make on the way back to the airport. The vehicles they use have wifi in them so that you can stay connected on the drive to and from the airport, and have water and other refreshments available as well. The meal I had in Masala Kraft was one of the best meals that I have had in India. The rooms were well appointed as well. General all around experience"
Wonderful stay with the best service ever. Like a little own sweet quite world in the busy Mumbai. Rooms like small paradise. Beds like sleeping on clouds. Friendly! Wasabi an experience beyond eating.
"This hotel must be the place to stay in Mumbai and glad we did but it is a huge hotel and lack the intimacy of the other hotels we stayed in during our trip. We stayed in the Palace wing which is the original part of the hotel with lots of period features such as the amazing grand staircase. I think this is a better alternative than the Tower wing. We had a club roon which gave us access to the club lounge with afternoon tea, cacktails and cognac and champagne, all of which we enjoyed. There are lots of restaurants, most of are quite or very expensive. The service was excellent and very professional. Worth staying here for the experience of a world famous hotel."
we booked a stay for the first time at the taj for our second marriage anniversary and had a wonderful time. would love to return to the hotel! the most amazing part of out stay was the view! thank god we booked the sea facing room!
"I had been here with family for a night's time and also enjoyed lunch the other day at the zodiac grill. Such a marvellous piece of art and architecture with over 500 rooms and lots of magnificent pillars with historic value. Professional staff and expertise in all areas with no complaints whatsoever. Zodiac grill is legendary with muted decor, stunning ceiling and an excellent piano artist. Defines ""fine dine"" in the true sense"
I had to attend an official function and I arrived early. So decided to taste some pastry cake and a cup of coffee. My selection was their signature choclate cake. The coffee was doable however the cake didn't taste anything special.  I won't recommend the cake to anyone. I hope they work on their bakery
"One of the beautiful and most important hotel of the world. A must have when you are in Mumbai with every corner that breathes history. Not only a 5 stars hotel: it's a regal service and staff all around you, from the welcome of the first day till the check out of the last one. Be a part of the story: visit it and enjoy your journey in this amazing Mumbai."
"I with my friend attended a business meeting at TAJ Mumbai. At the entrance itself i said WOW .THE GRAND LOBBY with a big flower vase in the center and the hotel is completely air conditioned. The marble flooring and the beautiful cascading waterfall on one side were mesmerizing to the eyes. there were different luxury stores inside the hotel, the views from the room were stunning u could see the gateway of India and the sea with little boats passing by through .the staff is well behaved in every way with a pleasant personality and courteous as well.We had a lovely meal .Tava murg,paneer makhani, baby corn in tomato gravy,dum aloo and naan. All dishes were absolutely tasty and tasted different from each other. We could not find one complain and enjoyed the day giving 10 out of"
"The Taj is a great hotel and a great experience - always. I opted to stay in the palace wing this time although I think next time will continue to stay in the tower wing as the rooms are newer, airier and service is quicker"
"This is a fantastic hotel which I recommend everyone to visit - at least once.  Generally most of the staff are absolutely excellent... A special mention goes out to the staff in the Palace Lounge who went way beyond the normal call of duty to keep us plied with refreshments.  The food in Souk, Zodiac Grill, Masala & Golden Dragon restaurants were to die for.... Beautifully cooked and presented. Excellent attentive staff too.  A special mention also to the Pool Staff / Attendant who took wonderful care of us.  My main issue on this occasion was our room.. We booked 2 X Club Rooms - city facing in the Palace wing for us and our friends.. The embarrassment came when one room was considerably larger that the other... Making sure that our friends had the superior room we complained"
"I have reviewed a lot of places on TA and rarely if ever have i given such a perfect score. Do, if you can, stay in the old heritage wing; it is wonderful. And if you can stump up for a club room overlooking the sea, so much the better. But what really makes this place so special is the service. I don't know how they do it, but absolutely everyone was outstanding."
"Myself and husband stayed here for two days. It is amazing we stayed in the palace the staff, food etc is second to none' and no problem is too small.  Mumbai itself is not my favourite place it's dirty and full of beggars, but I would defiantly say to anyone do it even if it's just once"
"Had a alumni dinner at Taj Mahal restro in Mumbai. A heritage place, a monumental hotel to be visited by every Indian.  Had a great dinner, quality, service and perfect ambiance.   Tip - Dont forget your way or its a Maze."
"I have traveled the world and hence stayed at a lot of hotels, some I remember, some I dont. But Taj Mahal Palace Hotel has to be one of the experiences that will remain with me for the rest of my life and I will make sure I visit this hotel again with my family even though it is at one end of the city and hence very far from the city attractions but still soooo worth it!"
"I don't understand how people are raving about this hotel as if you are speaking on a comfort level, a 3 star hotel has the same amenities. The room which was a deluxe with view on the gate and the sea was outdated,smelly and in serious need of renovation. The same went for the bathroom. Closet space was ridiculously small with 4 cheap hangers in there. The room cleanliness was below average. I only had breakfast there so I won't judge the quality of the restaurants other than the breakfast was ok. Check your bill at checkout as I got charged for breakfast when it was included in the package I had. They also charge 4 times (yes you read well) for two transfers at the airport. I emailed the hotel and still did not get an answer from anyone or credit on my credit card. I put two"
"This is an excellent hotel. the service, cleanliness, food are all impeccable. I enjoyed my stay very much. The location of the hotel is great. We were very much pampered at the Taj Mahal. I will come again."
"We stayed in the old bit of the hotel, the Palace bit and so got a room that smelled musty, to me. Changed rooms but the second one was no better, and I guess it's because they don't open windows and it's very humid. And maybe my nose is more sensitive than others. Anyway, some of the staff try really hard and are lovely and others are a little over the top, almost toadying. When I eat a meal I am happy for the waiter to serve me to begin with but if I wish for some more, I want to serve myself. How can they possibly know how much I want on my plate?   It felt as though the hotel was very much more geared to business people than to tourists and I felt a little uncomfortable being in a hotel who's shops include Versace, Dior and other expensive places. Mind you, it was fun to see"
"After staying in some of the best hotels on our travels form Delhi, The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, was the icing on the cake. Cannot fault anything with this world class hotel. Stayed in the tower overlooking the Gateway of India, with a sea view, and also in the Palace. Both memorable, but the Palace really is exquisite. Would recommend to anyone, and will go back again."
"I stayed at the hotel for two nights.  I had not stayed at the hotel for some time.  The venue is close to the Fort and Nariman Point area.   The hotel has been newly renovated. I stayed in the Palace wing which had lovely rooms.   Breakfast was available in two restaurants - the nicest was the Sea lounge which has a lovely view of the Gate of India. There appeared to be some other lovely restaurants to choose from in the hotel.   Whilst the quality of the service was exceptionally good, I felt that as a business traveller the hotel was too touristy.   Further most business travellers must be men - the toiletries were limited (although more could be ordered) and the hairdryer has no power (things which are important to female business travellers). "
"The Taj Mahal Mumbai is something which can not be describe ,The excellent hospitality guest rooms Restaurants,  but this fabulous hotel needs to provide dental kit and shaving kit to every rooms, thanks"
Will recommend this property ...Only missing is a Jacuzzi in health club. Otherwise the hotel has the heritage charm bulit in and off course the TATA ensigna all over. A 100 year old hotel which maintains its looks  and services... Will stay again
Was in Place Building . It's like a place in heart of city . If you want to be like a king for a day it's place in Mumbai to be in . Excellent service great view from room . You must try place wing when you checkin . You have wide range of option for Resturant to choose from and not to forget king size breakfast.    
We ended our trip to India here. We stayed in the old part of the hotel. This is a true grand dame of a hotel and the service and standards were top notch - faultless - living up to our expectations. The pool area is the perfect place to relax and unwind - a million miles away from the hustle and bustle of the streets outside. Our room did have a bit of a musty smell and they did everything they could to get rid of it with a humidifier and oil lamp - they did offer to move us to a different room however they all had the same smell -so we stayed where we were - I think they just need to open the windows and let the room air. If you get the chance to stay here do - you will not be disappointed.
"This was a 1001 night experience in architecture, taste, service, food and smiles coming from the heart. We certainly will be back next year and I only can recommend this hotel as a once in a lifetime experience."
"Stayed 2 nights here and have nothing more to say than it was amazing. The surroundings, the staff, the palace room (overlooking India Gate) all of it so beautiful . We arrived at 7am in the morning and the staff provided us with our room by 9am, normally its a 2 oclock check in for no extra cost and nothing was too much trouble. Its a definate repeat visit hotel. If nothing else just to tick off your ""have done list"""
"Stayed here a couple of times and felt like Royalty. Had one of the club rooms overlooking the gateway of india. It was the first time i was able to watch Tv while having a shower - loved it. There is a butler on every floor to help you, the rooms are spotless. Its a magical experience and well worth the cost. A great escape from the madness outside the door."
would have been even better if had made been made aware of the club package entittlements. The introduction on arrival/checking should have been more and clear informative. The staff were polite and courteous. the tour of the history was excellent and presenter Ms Sougatha was outstanding
"We travel extensively and widely and are lucky enough to be able to stay at many of the worlds best hotels. For our trip to India we chose to stay for 4 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai before travelling onto Goa for 5 nights at The Taj Exotica.  The Taj is expensive (although far from being the most) but perfection costs and it was a small price to pay to just savour the magic that the Taj conjures up. Dont count the costs - just go and enjoy!   We stayed in the original building and the hotel at our request gave us an excellent sea view club room on floor 5. Just perfect. The view of the sea/gateway was amazing. All rooms are good but its worth paying extra for that view.  Highlight was going to the ""Souk Restaurant"" at The Taj (top of the tower) and by pure chance"
"excellent and updated services in an historic establishment, astonishing and very posh shopping area (target only for very stuffed visitors...), fantastic pool and garden area, staff helpful (for room services, check in and out, pool and gym), good breakfast with plenty of choice, room just in front of India Gate (a surprise.), but a pity not possible to open Windows..."
"A two week holiday in India staying in some of the best hotels, and ending the holiday with two nights stay at the Taj. Beautiful location, with the best experience ever. Cannot fault the hotel in anyway at all. Ten out of ten in all sections."
"My husbond and I recently had a 2 night stay in this beautiful hotel. As I had emailed and informed them that my husbond had turned 50 earlier in the year we were given a free upgrade into the palace wing. This hotel was amazing, all guests were made to feel so special . The hotel did a walking tour at 5 pm every evening which was very informative and very interesting. During our stay we had the high tea overlooking the Gateway to India which was well worth the money, the host brought us all sorts of street foods and explained all of the ingredients to us. Staff were all very friendly and appeared to genuinely enjoy their work and talking with the guests. The memorial wall was beautiful and we were so glad they had commemerated the life of the dog as well as all the people that"
"We stayed here for two nights after a hectic Golden Triangle tour.  The hotel staff were fantastic, taking time to show us round the hotel, making us feel at ease immediately.  We were in the Palace with a sea room, which I cant recommend enough."
"Staying in Taj Mahal palace mumbai is an experience. Luxurious rooms, old world  charm, super efficient staff, amazing food, Beautiful ambience. Best hotels I have  stayed so far. Highly recommended. Must stay if you are planning a holiday in Mumbai. Bravo Taj! "
"Having seen the BBC series called the Hotel India twice and having a raised expectation, The Taj Mahal Place Hotel did not disappoint! - I have never been so impressed with their thoughtlessness and friendly staff service right across every discipline; the outside security guys, check-in staff, room cleaners, elevator guys, pool maintenance guys and not least Akshay and Pradeep from the Sea Lounge who every morning made me tester plates of Indian breakfast. What an experience it was to be a guest at the hotel, they really made our first trip to India a very memorable one, thank you so much!"
"A first class Hotel among first class hotels,expensive but definitely worth it .A Unique experience and the most professional staff you can find. A haven of tranquility and style in Mumbai,excellent location and facilities."
"I stayed on Nov 20, 2015 for a night. The room was wonderful bang opposite Gate Way of India, with its amazing view from room. The food was good at rooftop eatry. The Indian restaurant at lobby level was also wonderful, food was superb. The breakfast at coffeshop was also good. At all three eatries staff was very helpful and humble. Housekeeping was also good.   The only glitch was while checking inn and checking out. The front office staff was very casual. It seems they are only keen to attend celebs properly and they themselves were behaving like celebs.  All in all good experiance. Highly reccommended when in Mumbai."
"If ever one decides to visit this maximum city of MUMBAI, then one cant miss TAJ . here too I will recommend palace wing. the hospitality standards of the staff is so high here that you actually feel like heirs of raj era.  great room , great view, good pool, convenient location and extremely beautiful  heritage hotel.  must experience once in life."
Stayed here for the first three nights of our 17 day vacation. Excellent stay in the Tower with a fantastic view of the Gateway to India. First class customer experience from all of the staff without exception. The only place to stay in MUmbai!
"This is absolutely an ""oooh-aahh"" hotel - the historic wing is utterly gorgeous, the staff are great, the pool is spectacular, there is a room of free num-nums and breakfast comes with a view of the Gateway of India.  Stepping into the hotel is like stepping into a cool, calm, in-laid marble and orchid-riffic oasis... and doesn't feel like you're in the middle of a city of 22 million at all.  Highly, highly recommend!"
"Beautiful high end hotel. Super busy area. If you're not staying there it's an okay sight to see, if we did it again we would've stayed at least a night there to make the amount of traffic we had to sit through worth it."
"This hotel is thought of as the best in India, it is up there with the savoy, claridges and George V. It most defiantly is. A few highlights:  - sumptuous breakfast  - half price cocktails in the Starboard bar every eve between 5 and 8pm - a tour of Mumbai with the hotel driver from the airport to the hotel. - highly attentive pool attendants.   If your a five star person then this is the Mumbai hotel for you"
"Mix quality of staff. Mostly untrained, Breakfast service is very poor and selection is very limited compare to Leela or Hilton. Senior age staff has attitude issues. Room toilet are well below 5 star level. We were lucky to find one good Asstt. manager who was very helpful during the stay. In my opinion it is overrated."
"Loved this grand majestic hotel. Large spacious rooms with great views of India gate and the bay. The service was really tip top and we were made to feel very special. Plenty of choice of restaurants from casual poolside dining to a very formal restaurant. Beautiful pool and excellent spa treatments, I had a 'champi' ( Indian head massage.  Perfect location for sightseeing, shopping or business.  Large shopping arcade is very good. Joy have beautiful ladies sandals at very reasonable prices. High end designers here  also."
"Taj Palace, Mumbai hospitality that lingers in mind for months and I enjoy some privileges that comes with being a regular in this Edwardian Hotel which is in the heart of the Island City, very close to the Gateway of India, in the White City of Mumbai. What is a White City? You have to ask those who know Mumbai. The iconic Taj Mahal Palace & Tower hotel was built in 1903 and has accommodated everyone from royalty to common folk. Its structure is striking and has many chandeliers, archways, domes, and turrets. As far as luxury hotels in Mumbai are concerned, the Taj Palace & Tower is in a league of its own. The hotel is an unsurpassed architectural marvel that brings together Moorish, Oriental and Florentine styles. It also offers fabulous panoramic views over the Arabian ocean"
The best place to stay in Mumbai. This is located right at the Gateway of India and has an amazing view. Service is out of the world. Great restaurants. It just cant get better than this. Great memories of this place - Always...
"Staying at the Taj was definitely one of the highlights of my trip to India. From the location, to the amazing service of the staff, the architecture and design to the food and incredible breakfast buffet: everything was exquisite.  We stayed in a palace room overlooking the back courtyard. Wonderful room, silent and welcoming. Very comfortable bed."
"This is the place to stay in Mumbai and overall it didn't disappoint - but we did have some issues.  First piece of advice is that if you are going to splash out here then stay in the old part and not in the tower - there is a completely different atmosphere and the palace part is much nicer.  We had a club room king with sea view - very nice.  Comfortable bed, great bathroom, own butler.  We ate twice in the Indian restaurant (Masala Kraft) - excellent food, informal atmosphere - and the Chinese restaurant (Golden Dragon) - equally good and better atmosphere.  We tried to eat at the Souk - but see below about table reservations. Nice pool area but it can be busy.  OK, so what about the issues?  One lunch order mix-up (everyone makes mistakes), queue for breakfast at both"
"Even in a very short stay , I could sense the heritage flavour at Taj Mahal Mumbai.  The selection of  artwork and  music that is played in the lounge at the heritage  added  to the rich heritage experience at Taj. Also the  energy shown by Mr Nelson at Wasabi was amazing. He made my first visit to Wasabi a memorable one. The person at Shamiana  truly symbolizes a proactive service and someone who cares..."
"Hotel is good, service is good but need to improve in lot of things, After paying 20k a customer needs more amenities like Jacuzzi etc . People can try at least once to stay at that hotel. Also use the swimming pool. its good"
Location is pretty convenient though bit crowded and congested outside on the road. Hotel Lobby ambience is pretty good and variety of breakfast is reasonably good. Availability of WIFI was an issue inside room. It did not work.
"the best Hotel in Mumbai, clean, service very good. Food stupend..Pool quite and very nice. Rooms are very large..everythinks is working well. I raccomend to go there. People are very friendly and Honest"
Stayed here twice and really like the place.  The room in Palace wing are designed to give a feeling of living in a palace.  The amenities are great and the restaurant great to.  The bar was good to.  Anyone who want a experience of a Maharaja should not miss this hotel.
"I have stayed in the historic wings of the hotel twice.  On each occasion the whole experience was memorable.  The rooms were fresh, clean and impeccably maintained.  The butler service was unobtrusive and of the highest standard.  Highly recommended for a luxury stay in Mumbai!"
"As said, best hotel in mumbai, for location, quality, food, service... The building represents an historical piece of art itself, the pool is amazing, the people working there are the best profesionals i have seen."
You can not describe or review this one. Great location. Greater view. Grand architecture. Royal interior. Humble staffs. Heritage ambience. And lots of histories. The hottest backdrop for selfies near Gateway of India.
We decided to celebrate our anniversary at the Taj and could not have asked for a more perfect weekend.  The little touches and exceptional service were incredible with our every whim and desire taken care of.  We could not have asked for more.  Absolutely incredible!
"Wonderful experience..!! Had a stay in Taj lands end too but the experience here is far above...Service is awesome, food is awesome, wonderful hospitality.:*:*:* Its a life time experience..staying in such a master piece of luxury..."
"Mumbai was the first stop of our India tour, and we decided to stay at the Taj Palace for 1 night after reading some of the reviews on Trip advisor.  We used the prepaid taxi service from the airport, which took us about an hour before we reached the hotel.  Even though we arrived before check in time at the hotel, the staff was still able to accommodate us and even gave us a free room upgrade with a great view of the Arabian sea.  The hotel is immaculate with beautiful, luxurious grounds, outdoor pool, spacious rooms, and several restaurants to choose from.  Plentiful breakfast buffet, bottled water, and WIFI was included in our hotel rate. What I loved most about this hotel is the wonderful hospitality from all of the staff members who did not hesitate to provide assistance"
Its a really awesome place i hv ever been..the food and everythng is really good..specially non-vej items..and its well maintained..i will always prefer going to taj in future and ill advice every1 to cheer the moments in taj
"I have visited this hotel several times over the last 25 years and have never been disappointed with the wonderful service and the fantastic staff who really make this hotel. The location is very central, easy to walk to lots of attractions, restaurants and shops. I was upgraded this visit which was bittersweet as if it had happened on my last visit would have been so much better but an upgrade is an upgrade! I had a fabulous suite. It is worth splurging a bit and choosing Taj Heritage rooms as so much extra is included- the wonderful club lounge, inclusive hotel wide wifi, breakfast, an airport pick up and the lovely rooms. There was an issue with the pool which necessitated it closing which was very disappointing but the hotel arranged use of a sister hotel 5 mins drive away"
"Staying at the Taj Mahal in Mumbai justifies its standing as one of the world's great hotels. The hotel has it all and is an architectural masterpiece. The public areas are amazingly beautiful, the rooms are lovely; and the food, ambience and service are excellent. The location is outstanding, right across from the Gateway to India arch, and the waterfront adjacent to the hotel is a great place to take a stroll - day or night."
"We came here with our two young western girls who had never been in Asia, Africa or the Indian subcontinent before. The hotel is incredibly secure, with a stunning view and wonderful staff and amazing restaurants. We strongly recommend getting a room with club access. It makes you feel very much at home, vs being like a visitor. Masala Kraft!  OMG! Most fantastic meal ever. And the children were stunned by the chance to wash their hands at the dinner table! The restaurant invited us into their PRISTINE KITCHEN to see them make naan in the little round oven. What a treat. Easy place from which to wander out into your first moments in India."
Brilliant hotel and and great service even though it was sooooo busy. Staff were brilliant and made me feel at home. Waited on me with care and attention and most of all they were all very humble. This hotel was packed yet staff made me feel like I was the only guest there and made sure all I needed or requested was met and done  Thank you all  Jag 
"We live in Mumbai and wanted to break free from the routine. Staying at Taj Mahal palace was also something we wanted to do for a long time. This time we didn't wait for any occasion and we are so glad we did that.   We found the staff at the hotel extremely welcoming and warm. It reflects the rich tradition and legacy of both Taj, Tata and India. The stay was not an ordinary hotel stay but a trip down the memory lane."
"Beautiful building, the best service, great food, wonderful rooms, lovely pool area... Everything was just perfect! (We were there with small children for five nights.) There are rooms in both the old building and the more new tower, something to think of if you prefer any of it. "
"Everything about the Taj Palace Hotel was wonderful, a beautiful room with great attention to detail.We found the staff polite and helpful. This was a glorious building to explore, with its great artworks and stunning architecture."
"Great hotel ,you are staying in a national monument which is a very unique experience.The hotel is faultless in every respect. It is also in a great and historic location overlooking Inda Gate.  The hotel pool and reception are stunning and the  general ambience is opulent and relaxed ,it is not overpriced compared to hotels in London"
"The Taj Club level room and services are excellent and inviting.  The service is friendly, prompt and very helpful.  The history and location of the hotel are exceptional.  This hotel is not inexpensive, but all things considered, it is well worth the money."
Having backpacked for several weeks this was the most amazing experience to have at the end of my holiday. My bicycle and I were looked after extremely well and I wanted for nothing. I loved being provided with the iced water and ice cold flannels when I was by the swimming pool.
We stayed in a king club room for 2 nights and lets just say the service definately exceeded our expectations. All staff whether at the resteraunts or  housekeeping staff in the corridors are extremely polite and never fail to say a hello with a friendly smile. They kindly decked our room with balloons and presented us with a cake for my birthday which absolutely delighted my son. The only suggestion I would have is to perhaps reserve the palace lounge club for club guests first. We were told that the general public are allowed to use this too during the cocktail and canapes hour in the evening.This lounge was full on both the nights we went in and had to wait for a seat. I think if you are paying a premium for the room then the club guests should get priority first. Thank you
We wanted to splurge during our final 2 nights in Mumbai so we picked the Taj Palace Hotel.  We struggles with whether to stay in the old section or the new section.  We picked the new section and think we made the right decision.  Our room was on the 10th floor with a direct view of the India Gate.  The room was large with such a comfy bed and pillows.  We also had access to the older section of the hotel so feel like we missed out on very little.  The breakfast buffet busted my diet with a wonderful selection of everything we could have hoped for.  Service in all areas was expert.
"This hotel doesn't really require a review from me. It was there long before I was born and will be there, I hope, long after I'm gone. And that is what makes this place so special, a sense of history. We stayed in the palace, on the top floor, in a beautiful room with a perfect butler. The pool is sublime and having breakfast beside it a privilege I won't forget. I knew I had to stay at this hotel after reading about the courageous actions of its staff during the terror attacks. The commitment of the staff is obvious and their commitment to their hotel guests having a wonderful experience feels genuine and personal.  More than a hotel, an institution."
"My wife and I had a room on the second floor of the Taj. On one night of our stay, a very noisy party directly below us kept us awake. After we complained repeatedly, we were finally taken in our bathrobes up to a fourth floor room, leaving our luggage behind.  We were offered apologies but no discount on the room rate.  This total disregard for the comfort of guests is disgraceful."
"The Taj speaks for itself but everything about this place is off the hook, even upon arrival you are greeted by a very personal service which is often lost in big hotels.  The decor of this place blends Raj era with the new modern so well that you cannot fault it.  On our floor we had our own butler that attended every need and can organise anything (literally anything).  The restaurants are all world class and i only wish i could have eaten it all of them. Location is perfect, right on the waterfront and in the thick of it.  With only a 2-3 minute walk you are in the real Bombay and the hustle and bustle.  Cannot wait to go back.."
"The Taj Palace Hotel history has to be read before visiting the Hotel. Upon arrival the guards dressed in white with matching turbans will extend a wam welcome. The Hotel consists of the old wing and the new tower. We were wisely advised to select the old wing where you can savour the bygone life whilst still enjoying every modern luxury. The choice for dining is so extensive it's a delightful problem choosing which restaurant to go to. We had a special dinner, with a very special friend in The Zodiac restaurant which I can honestly say was  one of the finest dinnersI have enjoyed. The ambiance, cuisine and service were better than any Michelin star restaurant I have been to whether 3 stars or below. Sadly this restaurant is soon to close...miss it at your peril."
"Stay at the Taj, the service makes business better. The back up from the guest services makes having cars and reservations taken care of easily. The Coffee Shop provides good atmosphere of both meetings and dinning. Made a short trip really worthwhile. thanks."
a fantastic hotel - second to none -  the service and the staff is excelent the pool area in the center of Mumbai is a dream a hotel i have stayed at more than 100 times and will always stay when in Mimbai !
Probably one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.Excellent in every respect.One feels like a Maharaja the Staff looked after us very well.We were also informed by the management that we had left behind one of our item which will be sent to us for free. Keep it up.
"Excellent hotel in all ways : an historical monument, a very good location, a very nice place, real good food with a very wide choice, an excellent service. Great pool area.  ""The"" hotel of Mumbay to be. A real must."
"I had seen a documentary series in the UK about this hotel and was intrigued. I kept checking the hotel website and eventually found the Diwali rate which is much lower than normal. I requested a non smoking high floor room. On arrival on 8 November 2015 I was greeted by the Concierge Irfan who took me through the passport formalities. I was then greeted by Zeena who I believe is an assistant  manager. She placed a garland around my neck. By now I was feeling rather special. I was allocated room 1912 which is  the top floor of the Tower and designated Deluxe. It was a well appointed room. As part of the Diwali rate I was invited on a tour of the hotel conducted by Zeena. It was very informative and whilst it is a rather ""dry"" subject it was enlivened by Zeena's humour. Later I"
"When you want to feel home far away from home, when you want to receive royal treatment, when you want to have the luxury choice of classy new style Mumbai majestic rooms or beautiful classic Maharastri rooms, please book a room in this hotel.  The staff is excellent, well trained, extremely polite. This hotel is a true example of high standard treatment..."
The experience was outstanding from the moment I entered the hotel. The check in was very smooth. The rooms are excellent and luxurious. Food was outstanding and service true to Taj style. We were fortunate to be taken for heritage walk within the hotel. I think the hotel is a symbol of the entrepreneurial spirit and pride of every Indian. Hats off to the Tata group and all its employees. 
Stayed 5 nights in late October 2015. Exceeded all expectations. Booked standard room but got upgrade for free. Arrived early at 730am and got access to room by 10am. Coffee served in our room as a free treat. Breakfasts were excellent. Pool area was fabulous. A real piece of heaven in a city of 22 million.
"this is the best hotel to stay in South Bombay. in terms of location but more importantly in terms of the service. Even if you encounter something to your dislike, they try to take care. I have stayed a few times to great memories always."
"It was the most wonderful stay I have ever had anywhere in the world. Everything was so nice from inside out. The hotel and the room was beautiful, the bed and pillows were so soft and comfortable, the bathroom was beautifully decorated. The service was beyond attentive. Also, dinner in Masala Kraft restaurant was excellent! I literally have nothing negative to say about my stay at all.   Before I went I thought it was quite expensive to stay here, but after checking out I thought it was worth the money I spent.   Tip: I recommend you to choose a room in the palace side, it is so charming."
"The Taj Mahal Palace.. wow it's really palatial to say the least.  And the trade mark hospitality puts you at perfect ease.  The hotel has 2 wings the Tower and the Palace as they are popularly known as. Parking has been restricted to drop and pick up after the 26/11 incidents. The interiors are as plush as one would like them to be with each nook and corner spic and span even to the last washroom.  We attended a conference in the Crystal Room and each facility was world class be it the acoustics, the refreshments the service et al. The view from several ledge /windows and rooms of the boats moored near the gateway is breath taking. It read the hotel had done 110 years.. I am sure it will do many more."
"Stayed in a Tower room right across from the Gateway. Sunset and sunrise absolutely stunning! I didn't see any of the rooms in the Palace wing, but I have no complaints at all about mine. A few quirks like being greeted with flowers, escorted to the room by the receptionist and a bathroom mirror which middle never fogs up made this a very special place to stay. They offer a tour of the hotel for guests every afternoon and it is a fantastic introduction to the hotel and its services. Don't miss it. I highly recommend this hotel and would certainly stay here again on another visit to Mumbai."
Having seen a lot about this hotel on the BBC series ; i can seriously say it is pure old school unique. The admin side is a little chaotic you think when you first receive emails that someone is personally looking after your stay and then you receive other emails which do not coordinate this theme continues throughout as you are bombarded with people at your service which may not coordinate with others at your service. This in fact resulted in an amazing experience as most of the offers were great in their own right .  It was a significant birthday and I received no less than 3 cakes on the day! One i think was in total error along with champagne but the hotel apologised for the error and let me enjoy it at their expense!  Dinner at the Zodiac restaurant was fantastic where we
We stayed here on a recent trip to Mumbai. It is a great looking hotel surrounded by great landmarks. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The staff were helpful. Would definitely recommend it.  My suggestion is that this is not the only hotel you stay at if you are visiting Mumbai as a tourist since the hotel is so beautiful and the environment so nice that you want to stay inside. The interesting thing about visiting Mumbai is everything that is going on outside.
"Taj hotels set the standard in terms of service in India. During our last trip we stayed at both the Lake Palace, Udaipur and here. On this trip we spent two nights in The Taj Mahal Palace. On our previous stay we had a tower room which rather took the shine off the experience. This time we took a good sea-view room in the main hotel. We did not experience any undue on street noise as noted by other reviews, but we did marvel at the fantastic sunrise over the sea each morning. (Also pleased to find that wi-fi is now free at last!) The service is without parallel; leave an untidy iPhone charger lying around and it will be perfectly coiled and secured with a velcro strap; leave a guide book open on the desk and return to find a Taj bookmark thoughtfully place upon it. Dining"
"I stayed in 2 Taj Hotels during my business trip to India, the first was in Delhi and I think I was a little spoiled, as the hotel was located in a very quiet part of Delhi and the bedrooms were very modern and luxurious. The Taj Mahal Palace is an older hotel, it's located in a pretty lively part of Mumbai (opposite the Gateway to India) and I felt the bedrooms were a little less luxurious than those in Delhi. I was very concerned that the road noise was going to be a big problem at night, however, I was very pleasantly surprised when it completely stopped about midnight! I was delighted to return to the hotel one evening to find a complimentary foot bath placed in my room, filled with rose petals... a lovely lovely treat! The hotels bars and restaurants were first class as"
"My husband booked us here as a treat for my birthday. I can't rave enough about the service. Our room was upgraded and we had an incredible view of the Gateway of India. Room was decorated for my birthday and was surprised coming back from dinner with a cake! Business centre staff were exceptionally patient and assisted us with obtaining an Indian sim card (process was more complicated than anything I had experienced before in obtaining a sim). Nothing was a problem for the staff. We had a very late train leaving Mumbai and we were able to make use of the facilities (including showers) until we left that night. Room was clean, bed was comfortable and all was very quiet. Breakfast was wonderful and staff were efficient and ensured we were aware of our options. Take the historical"
"Taj never disappoints where service is concerned. Staff is very courteous, helpful and very very considerate. Amenities are what one would expect at this level. They upgraded me to a room with an excellent view. I can't wait to get back."
"The title says it all. Couldn't have been better - if you're considering a stay it's most definitely worth it! It's a step above the rest, one of Mumbai's most famous institutions and it manages to retain a friendly and warm atmosphere."
"The Taj, overlooking the Gate of India, is a beautifully restorative place to stay after you've been traveling around the country.  Though it's crowded and the breakfast line was unacceptably long, the room was lovely and the spa treatments outstanding."
I stayed at the Taj Palace Bombay for almost 10 days and cannot be more eloquent about the quality of service and the warmth exuded by every employee at this heritage property.  The hotel is well located and is ideal for both business and leisure travellers.  The room tariffs are very affordable and I highly recommend this hotel to everyone who is a visitor to Bombay/India.
"We stayed at the Taj Palace for 3 nights. This is a large urban resort property, with a historic wing and a newer tower. For a large resort, you never get the feeling of a number as at every amenity there are at least 2 or 3 attendants waiting to assist you, offer you water or guide you. This can be unnerving at first,  but it is genuinely solicitous, never unctuous.   There is a great spa and fitness center. The treatments are a little expensive, but offer a good value. The fitness center has multiple machines of every style so there's not much chance of not getting your preferred equipment.   Breakfast array is extensive - the best we saw in India - with several custom options and , as mentioned above, attentive staff.   On-site restaurants serve a great variety, all high"
"A heartfelt thank you to the management and team for making my son's 18th birthday unforgettable. From the meticulous planning involved in having eighteen people at strategic points to hand cards/scrolls to my son as we made our way through the Palace wing to the fabulous suite bedecked with balloons and the birthday cake and wine and flowers, you really surpassed our expectations. Thanks too to the housekeeping team for the rose petal baths, the foot spa and the gifts and to Palace services who all contributed to a memorable stay. We received the same wonderful service on returning the following week. We particularly enjoyed the high tea in the sea lounge, with its views over the Gateway of India , the ambiance of the pool area (we highly recommend the crab in filo pastry at"
"I am frequent Globe traveller and stayed in most of the big 5 start hotels. But nothing compared to The Taj Mahal Palace. I did stay in Taj Lands End and other properties in India.   This was my first time stay at The Taj Mahal Palace with family. Glad that I been upgraded to Palace suite. Had to previlage to use the Palace lounge and did dine at 2 restaurant (Souk and Golden Dragon) during my 2 night stay. My original stay plan was for one day and later after seeing the service and ambiance, I extended my stay for one more day.  Staff were too good. They pamper the guest so well and make them feel so important. I can give full point and mark towards Customer Centricity.   Me and my wife, would like to thank all the staff, whom we interacted.. to name a few, who left a lasting"
I have been coming to the Taj for 30 years. First we were back packers and went there for anight of luxury. Now we make sure each time we come to Mumbai we stay at teh Taj at teh end of our trip. i tell everyone it is te best hotel in the world and I wil continue to do so. We see staff we haev seen for yerars and it feels liek we know it so well. We did find it had changed as you cannot have breakfast outside by the pool aymore which is a shame.
"This hotel is one of my favourite worldwide. I have stayed at the Taj Mahall Palace many times over the last 6 years.  The atmosphere and the staff is the best! If you want a feel for being in India, and not just any hotel, then this is the place to stay."
"This was my first trip to India. As a solo female traveler, I  chose this hotel because of its location and 5-start rating. The hotel was beautiful, with many high-end stores and a good selection of restaurants. I hired a private tour guide but did venture out of the hotel on my own during the day. I stayed fairly close to the hotel, doing some shopping. I felt comfortably safe but did not go out at night by myself. Overall, great hotel in a good location."
"Stayed at the heritage wing for three nights. Fantastic visit  - staff were fantastic hosts - good breakfast, would recommend getting a spot by the window overlooking the Gateway - Masala Kraft offers some fantastic Indian food"
My husband and stayed here for a couple of nights at the start of a tour of India. What can I say the hotel is wonderfully luxurious and the service the best I have had anywhere! Nothing is too much trouble. After all the hustle and bustle of Mumbai the serenity you feel when you go through the doors of the hotel cannot be surpassed. The pool is wonderful and the restaurants we ate in could not be faulted. The only small and I mean small criticism I would have is that the hair driers are not of a quality that matches the rest of the hotel. This is not a big issue though!  Can't wait to come back to this hotel.  We ate in masala Kraft which was out of this world.
"My wife and i were lucky enough to stay at this beautiful hotel for or week end away. Everything about the hotel was beautiful, elegant and wonderfully presented. The staff were all helpful and unobtrusive, whilst always providing standard that is well above that of many over hotels at this level. I could write a complete article on the joys of staying at this hotel, but it is easier to just say START HERE IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY whilst you are in Mumbai.  If only for one night, STAY HERE."
"We stayed for three night’s en-route from London to Goa.    As on our previous stay, we had a room on the 12th floor of the Tower overlooking Gateway of India. Rooms are comfortable, ours had a small terrace although the mosquito mesh on the outside of the terrace detracted slightly (and also prevented us taking decent photos from our room). The range of bars and restaurants appealed. Aquarius was great during the day, an open air poolside bar also doing light meals. We particularly liked the more secluded seats and tables on the east side.  Our room rate included buffet breakfast in the all-day Shamiana restaurant. The Harbour Bar is the place for an evening drink, with tables overlooking Apollo Bunder and the lit horse drawn carriages passing by. Don’t miss the signature"
"I have traveled to the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai hotel on a number of occasions, mostly for business purposes for attending conferences.  Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai is undoubtedly the best hotel I have ever been to. The quality of food and service is absolutely impeccable.  If you want to have a lazy afternoon high tea, then Sea Lounge on the first floor is the place to be. What an experience it was, much so due to the amazing service from the personal butler."
"I spent three nights in the Taj Palace, and was not disappointed. The attentiveness of the staff, the luxuriousness of the facility - all equaled or surpassed what I'd heard. The hotel itself is exquisite, maintained in loving detail. I particularly enjoyed the very relaxed sitting room feeling of the Seaview Cafe, where breakfast is served on the Palace side. It's intimate and exclusive-feeling, and I found myself lingering over coffee, new newspapers, and the view.  My room was well-appointed and well-tended. I slept well.  I can recommend this hotel heartily. However, if you're a business traveler do be aware that the Taj Palace is located in the south of the city, and traffic is gridlocked. So be sure that you can get to your meetings in reasonable time from the location."
This hotel totally lived up to its reputation as perhaps the best hotel in the world. Anyone can book a stay in this hotel blindfolded and will not be disappointed in any possible way! It is unbelievable how well this hotel has recovered from its trauma over 7 years ago.
"Lovely hotel, super comfortable bed and fab service.  Have high tea buffet in the sea lounge over looking India Gate and indulge in wonderful indian food, sandwiches and scones and tasty house blend tea.  Wander through the corridors on an heritage tour to discover the history of the hotel and then chill out by the beautiful pool.  Truly is a wonderful place"
"Every time i come to Mumbai I cannot go past the Taj. The service is fantastic and the locality is perfect for what I need. I come to Mumbai 2 times a year and for a women traveling on her own, I feel safe in this hotel"
"Taj mahal palace hotel is very awesome. it beyond my expectations. I thought it will be very old hotel with old facilities.  but in fact it is not.  all the things is five star.  big room,  beautiful toilet with its beautiful marbel and strong flush of shower.  water temperature easily controlled.  quiet air conditioning, comfortable bed and it has  so many electricity outlet. the service is outstanding, from the reception until the restaurant waitress.  I enjoy Taj mahal palace,  sure will come back for my next visit to Mumbai. "
"Beyond expectations from the moment we were met at the airport to when we had to leave. We opted for a Taj Club room with a sea view and got upgraded to the Maratha Suite. It goes without saying the suite was stunning, but more importantly the staff were beyond incredible. The care and attention shown to us was so appreciated. Our luggage had been lost by the airline and the Taj staff did everything they could to make our stay comfortable by providing toiletries and pyjamas whilst trying to contact our airline for us. Every detail was thought of, so many surprises were left in the suite for us, from balloons for my birthday to wine, cake, petals and even foot scrubs!  Breakfast by the pool was beautiful with a large selection of food. On the last day we had breakfast in the Sea"
"My sister in law and I visited and stayed for four unbelievably wonderful four days. Everything about this hotel is first class, from being picked up at the airport to attention to the smallest detail during our stay. Nothing was too much trouble.  We felt like we were being welcomed into part of a large and wonderful family. Staff tend to have been there for many years. All genuinely appear to love what they do and to exhibit great pride in working here.  The food is wonderful with something to cater for all tastes. The rooms are extremely comfortable as are the beds.  Wifi was included and worked very well and was fast. The business centre is open all hours and had computers available for those not carrying their own technology.  A quick stroll,over the road is the gateway to"
A Mumbai institution! A must to stay at when in the city - slightly disappointed that the pool was closed but i suppose these things happen. Great service though - they really are al their guests feel special and welcomed.
"We arrived at the Taj Mahal palace straight from the airport. They were extremely polite and helpful. I had my baggage lost at the airport and they took at the details and told me they would deal with it all for me. They even provided me with silk PJs to sleep in. The room was beautiful with a wonderful view of the gateway to India and we were welcomed into our room with welcome drinks. The only down fall and it is so minor is that at breakfast (which gives you the biggest selection you've ever seen!) you had to use the same spoon, knife and fork which isn't great if you've had curry then need to use the same knife to butter your bread. All in all I would highly recommend!  "
"This place was the classic Bombay Hotel. Great full service, well trained staff and absolutely delicious food. Especially the breakfast buffet and high tea served each day!  Loved staying in the older section and an upgrade to a suite also helped!   Dinner in Marsala Kraft was a treat as was simply enjoying the ambience at the pool side.   Decor was old world and impeccable. Diverse clientele made it so fun! Room 263 has a partial view of the Gateway of India!    I will return!"
"Taj Mahal, wonderful solution for a stay in Mumbai also for a business trip. Good position, excellent service and the best way to recover after a working day. Excellent range of restaurants in the hotel with many solutions for food."
We had a lovely stay and were upgraded to the Palace rooms (thanks!). The bed was really comfortable and the room lovely. Breakfast was superb and the pool provided a restful break at the end of the day. Staff were all amazing and really friendly. The hotel is well located for the major sights and there are lots of good restaurants nearby. 
Recently visited The Taj whilst on business and the facilities and helpful staff were above 5 stars in  our opinion. Truly accommodating rooms on the 6th Floor. Fantastic views overlooking India Gate. Afternoon tea was always in my diary. This Taj Hotel is worth visiting just to see their flower displays alone fresh everyday. I could eat their breakfast every day 24/7.
"In my opinion and have traveled a lot. The Taj Mahal is the best hotel I have stay at. Not just because of the location and deco, which are excellent. But because every single person of the staff  is more service minded, respectful and positive."
Excellent and attentive service - pretty much faultless - and a great room - we were given a 6/F Club room which was exceptionally comfortable - breakfast in the Sea Lounge was very good - dinner in the Golden Dragon extremely good. High marks overall!
"The Taj in Mumbai offered a service that could not be surpassed. The staff is not happy until they have catered to your every wish. The rooms were lovely no matter where they were located. We needed laundry service and a tailor. The response time to getting everything cleaned, pressed, and sewed was a record breaker and The end result was perfect!  Sandeep was at the concierge desk who helped us with a huge problem and his persistency and results were wonderful!  Location was fantastic for this property overlooking the water. A place not to be missed!"
"My mother, friend and I,  had afternoon tea at the Taj Mahal Palace today.  The sea lounge was a beautiful room, the service was very good. This hotel is beautiful and must be visited. I would definitely stay here if I was to visit Mumbai in the future. The food was delightful and so much of it. "
"Taj Mahal is big name in hotel industry. One expects something outstanding. First, me and my business colleagues were given rooms at Taj Mahal Towers wing. We were shocked, size, furniture and facilities are of 3-4 star standard. We asked Hotel management to find better rooms for us. They gave us rooms at Taj Mahal Palace wing - rooms bigger and better. One thing coommon to all rooms is the ols and stained flooring carpetthat needs be immediately replaced"
"from check in to check out  absolutely excellent customer service ,  we were offered to sit in palace lounge during check in offered drinks and snacks our request for interconnecting rooms was not possible instead we were offered 2 club rooms next to each other side sea facing ,attendant took us up to our rooms personally and told us about  the facilities of the hotel, children were given soft toys and board games mad them feel special. Breakfast was divine so much to choose from most of the dishes made to order , waiters all so ready and willing to help but not hovering around you to make you feel uncomfortable"
"Fantastic communal areas, especially in historic palace, with huge choice of restaurants. Food and service excellent. Massive security to get into hotel, which is reassuring after horrific terrorist attack in 2008 ( of which there is a moving memorial in the lobby). Front of house service excellent. Room a disappointment, our corridor was being refurbished, and the note to say to say was for a future benefit  was a bit galling, as unlikely we will pass that way again. However overall an outstanding hotel."
I had to cut short my stay and the staff that handled the request were very understanding. Good amenities. Gorgeous surroundings. No order was too hard and no request was difficult for staff. Parazad was very warm and understanding in his communication.
"Yet another wonderful stay at this discreet but luxurious historic hotel. We had a club room on the 6th floor, the service was superlative, the room beautiful with a lavish white marbled bathroom. The staff are so well trained, polite and look after all your needs. We dined in the hotel, food and service again excellent. The true mark of an hotel is how it helps its clients in an emergency. My friend who I was travelling with suddenly had a problem with his back, on our morning of departure and could not walk. The room butler immediately organised a wheelchair, the travel desk arranged wheel chairs at the airport and with the airline, A taj representative met our car at the airport, checked us in and arranged all formalaties. That is what I call service. Well done Taj and thank"
"A three night stay was really good once a few teething problems were sorted out. Arriving at 0130 after a 9 hour flight it was lovely to hear that we had been upgraded.  What a nice surprise.  Except that we hadn't been as we were put into the room level we had originally booked.  This, coupled with a few housekeeping and cleanliness issues, meant that we were actually upgraded to a beautiful suite after the first night.  Service was amazing and delivered in a personal and truly caring manner to ensure everything was as it should be.  It is a truly beautiful building and still earns its iconic status."
If you have to be in Mumbai then this is the best hotel.   Lovely rooms in the old Taj building.  Service was excellent.  Good choice of restaurants in hotel. Have stayed here many decades ago and still the best..fond memories.
"This is the most known hotel of india, most luxurious hotel and very old established ...very nice river view ... well maintained , well built , 11-sept some unacceptable incident was happen , rest in peace , my dream is to stay in this hotel"
"Stayed in the hotel after a long gap and it was a very pleasant experience to come back again. Excellent location and view is the big advantage. However the rooms needs renovation, even the new wing. Food and hospitality is beyond comparison...excellent as Taj as always been."
"Fantastic hotel , rooms immaculate staff brilliant service can't say enough good things about our stay.the service was top notch , food well prepared good restaurants in house as well as the tea room , brilliant sea view over looking the gateway to India."
•	Taj Mahal Palace hotel looks very impressive and the superior room we had was in the Tower with a great view over the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea. We were surprised that we have had better rooms or equivalent in other hotels around the world however the bed and pillows were the most comfortable ever and the breakfast was the best we have experienced. The hotel is elegant and beautifully set in the lounge and pool areas and the breakfast service and overall cleanliness is very good
"I have reviewed this Hotel before but this time I stayed in the Palace wing as opposed to the tower. Fantastic. I just cannot fault this amazing Hotel, it was my treat at the end of a 15 day trip round Gujarat state in India. Just had to fly back via Mumbai to stay here again. Situated right at the gateway to India, sea views and great shopping, Must come back again."
"Had always wanted to stay here after previous visits to the hotel shops / restaurants in previous visits to Mumbai.  It was well worth the splurge.  The location in amazing, but the hotel is so incredible that be warned; you may never want to leave the hotel.  And be sure to eat at Masala Kraft - it's a meal to remember!"
"Superb hotel by all measures. It has history, splendor, uniqueness all combined to give patrons a wow feel.  We were put up in the heritage wing - and I would encourage everyone to ask for a room in the heritage wing and not the new tower. The room had a high ceiling, was spacious and very well maintained. It was our anniversary and they filled up the room with red balloons and a cake which was to die for. The servers were polite and wished us which was a good touch.  Otherwise, the tour of the hotel was unique and interesting. The breakfast buffet was a slight let down by the high standards but only because it was a busy weekend and staff was at wits end trying to accommodate everyone.  All in all a great experience, and will definitely be back some day for another swing. Kudos"
"This is a superior hotel offering peace and quiet with excellent service. When entering the heat, noise and stress instantly fall away leaving you cool, calm and collected. There are several bars and restaurants all with a very appealing atmosphere. The food quality was excellent in those that I tried. I was lucky enough to have a room with a view of the Gateway to India which was an added bonus. I was there for only three days but it was a highlight of my wonderful two weeks in India."
excellent hotel overall!!  There was some mixup with rooms! There were 4 couples checking in at one time and there was a mixup with rooms and it seemed difficult to alert the front desk about the confusion;  ultimately this issue was resolved
"this stay saved our complete india trip - after many disappointments, we needed some really good service! every request was fulfilled, everybody was really nice and made us feel welcome. and what was the definitely a plus were the scent/air refresher used."
"This is our fourth visit to this lovely Hotel and certainly will not be our last. The charm of the Hotel is endearing, the staff are a credit to the Taj and its owners. You must try as many of the restaurants as you can, the food is quite excellent. a must is to try the special Harbour 1933 cocktail, you will want a second that's for sure."
"A really lovely hotel - lots of atmosphere and history. Impeccable service. Nothing was too much trouble and every member of staff was unfailingly charming.  A good location for the ""old town"" and all the sights"
"It was the most incredible hotel experience of my life. This colonial style hotel is full of old world charm. My husband and I were treated like special guests from the moment we stepped onto the property. The security at the entrance was understandably tight with an airport style xray machine (no doubt after the historical terrorist attack on the property). However, the turbaned doorman and security guards greeted us with he utmost respect.  The check in was smooth, although I found the lady at reception to be a bit cold and arrogant. I loved the beautiful silk sarees that the ladies at reception wore. We were shown to our room in the old wing of the hotel and found it smelled musty and felt damp. We were told this was inevitable due to high humidity during the monsoon season"
"The place, the people, the food and the mood were so welcoming and close to the heart that I didn't feel I was a stranger to these people. The decoration of the rooms put you at ease to rest comfortably, The outlets are always ready to serve and the food had in many instances the WAW factor. The butlers showed they were realy YOUR butlers which added to the effect of this feeling being at home."
"It does justice to its name ""Palace"" - apart from being an architectural marvel what makes it class apart is the service! The staff puts in all the effort to make the stay the most memorable one for its guests. I had a Taj Club room and the added perks are worth spending a bit more. Personalized check-in , Palace Lounge access, evening complimentary drinks and much more. I found the room a bit smaller than expected. All in all its picture perfect!"
"It was amazing to see this place up and close. Have been to bombay so many times but never went inside taj. It is beautiful. There are a lot of places to eat here. The pool is amazing. And the hotel has a very good view of the gateway of india. If you're in bombay, do drop in for the experience. "
"this is one of the best experiences we ever had. Beautiful hotel, fantastic rooms, excellent personnel. Perfect location as well, right at the Gate of India. Tip: breakfast is marvellous. The swimming pool is a must try. Nice bars and restaurants, very goor food."
"The Taj is a great hotel, luxurious, food is great. Rooms are quite large compared to the Taj in Colaba and comfortable. Food is good with a good spread at breakfast. Also located close to South Bombay business areas"
"TAJ Hotel has been fully renovated in the past few years and it now seems even more luxurious than I remember. the lobby bar was very empty and remained so till we left. The service was OK and drinks were still overpriced, but bearable during happy hours."
"After seeing the BBC documentary about the Taj Hotel, we decided that the next time we go to India, we'll definitely stay there. It just so happened that within a year we were off to India. So I booked on line, well in advance and the rates were quite reasonable. When we got there, we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a room with access to their 'Palace Lounge' which gives complimentary afternoon tea and snacks and evening beverages and hot canapes. Which we did and it was well worth it. One of the best Hotel Lounges I've been to and something that the Hilton could definitely learn from. Anyway, my wife and I have now sworn an allegiance that we'll always stay atleast one night at the Taj Mahal hotel when ever we come to Mumbai!!!"
I have stayed at this hotel 4 times in my life . And I look forward to staying again . This trip they upgraded me to the palace . I booked thru Expedia and would not expect a upgrade . $140 a night for a 5 star hotel and the service you get . One day they said the duty manager has a message for you . They wanted to know if I would like to change my room because there might be noise from a party . There was no noise but I aperate the offer .
I stayed one night in my way to pune. on arrival in Mumbai international airport 2 smart guys came for puck up. they treated quite professionally and quite classy. upon riding on the car they offered a set of cold drinks and a cold towel to freshen up my skin.  the check in process was quite uniqe. a very polite and beautiful lady came with a welcome drink and after usual greetings she led me to my room and even didn't  bother me for normal check in process. check in process was completed in the room . the room was clean and beautifully designed and with a direct view to the gate of India.   in Mumbai you normally don't feel safe but this hotel completely changes your opinion about the city.  the hotel consists of a tower which is newer and a palace which ages back the 19th
"It's just an outstanding hotel w great hospitality and wonderful staff. On different levels staff tries to exceed ur expectations. I was most impressed by the gentleman who was cleaning my room. So much dedication, devotion and attention to detail I have never experienced before. Highly recommended"
"THIS wonderfully luxurious hotel is a must anyOne travelling to that part of the world who is interested in a truly luxurious and plush stay. GREAT spa. Wonderful food. Excellent caviar. Wonderful views. Access to yachts. Personal butler at your beck and call 24/7. If you are a fan of true luxury with history, then this is the place for you.   Shops in the hotel - Christan Dior. LV. Mont Blanc. Gold and diamond jewellers (specifically Kapil Malhotra).   I stayed on the penthouse floor of the heritage wing which is the more luxurious wing and involves private check in."
"Only an over night in the main hotel, our stay was wonderful, we enjoyed our evening meal outside  by the pool , later had a swim in the beautiful large pool very refreshing with the chill just taken off the water. The room I  could not ask for better we had the best nights sleep. Smooth airport pick up and lovely welcome on arrival."
"Heritage property ..Rich History  The Taj palace needs no introduction everything is just awsome First that serene view of the sea with heritage site Gateway of India around and the staff -our overall interaction with staff was superb - specially Guest relations. They were courteous, smiling and genuinely concerned about our comfort. my Kids actually had fun and the staff were sweet enough to provide some games for them to play, palace rooms are great hot tub, bubble bath the works ...Would definetely want to stay again especially with the same staff."
"Excellent Staff, Nice Welcome, good arrangement made by Guest Relations team. Very Good arrangements being done by the Hotel for my Son's birthday.   Delicious food, nice hotel, nice ambience Would recommend every1 to visit and stay ."
"The Taj Mahal Palace, hotel where I stayed no. of times and have always excellent experience. this time I stayed at Tower Wing on higher floor facing sea/Gateway Of India.it was GREAT view. room was clean & calm with all required amenities. choice of restaurants and food is unmatched here. Food quality and choice was excellent at ""Masala Craft-Indian cuisine and also at coffee shop."
The Taj Mahal Hotel Hospitality is World Class. Its location is also too good and sea side view is very fine. Food is very fine for the moderate taste. It's a Heritage Building with Modern Facelities. I had stayed in Executive Suit.
A great place that makes you feel like a royalty and pamper you royal and spoil you. A wonderful experience that you should experience and it would be only then you know what kings and kings of bygone eras and head of states of current times experience.
"Place of silence in this buzzling city. Top service by top-trained employees. Old heritage wing is ""must"" and comfort/benfits of the club rooms the cream on top. Only onê small thing which could be improved is the cocktail selection in club lounge - other than than close to perfect."
"The iconic hotel building is famous world wide and no need to intro. I was in Executive suite and that was a memorable experience for me, such a huge suite with large bathroom, dining area, study room, living room and obviously a big bedroom... fantastic...... Breakfast was also gr8 at Sealounge."
"Stayed for two weeks on business in October. The Taj is in a great location with great views and prides itself on its' service, however in this area it seems to try too hard, they seem to have a fixed idea of what good customer service is, which may not be to everyone's tastes:  When I arrive after a long overnight trip, I just want to be checked in as quickly as possible and get to my room to relax and freshen up; I don't want to spend 15/20 minutes sitting around while various people come up to say hello.  At breakfast, I do not want to be pestered after every mouthful by various people to ask me if I want eggs, I didn't want them when the last guy asked, nothing has happened in the last 23 seconds to change my mind; I do not want a running commentary about whether I've had a"
Taj Brand embodies excellence and this visit did not disappoint. I was fortunately upgraded to an amazing view overlooking the Gateway - I felt it was like looking at a majestic painting. The pool is one of the best in India. The staff were courteous and the hotel didn't seem too busy so overall was a very comfortable stay.
We have started our great indian journey and we chose this hotel We travel a lot and this is one of the nicest places I have stayed . The staff go out of there way to be helpful.Hotel is really very well maintained.
"After staying at the Oberoi in Gurgaon/ Delhi, this property comes as a disappointment. The pros are many: remarkable location overlooking the bay, delicious breakfast buffet, and extremely attentive service everywhere.  But my room was definitely showing its age with very dated decor and a bathroom crying out for a face lift..  Perhaps it is not fair to compare the two as the Oberoi relatively new and the Taj is not.  But this hotel did not provide a five star experience for me."
"Though it was a business trip, I enjoyed staying at Taj Palace.   One who wants to stay at a Palace with full of history, I recommend them this is the right place.   Hospitality to the core, courteous staff, good food, cleanliness, value for money, everything you get at one place.  Just opposite to the Gate of India,"
"You would expect the Taj to be special but this was one of those defining experiences that shows how Hotels can operate.  From the welcome at the airport to the greetings at the Hotel, from the way staff who would inter-act and with genuine courtesy ask about your needs the service was exemplary.  The rooms were well appointed, the restaurants just amazing and when my partner was having her Birthday they arranged flowers and balloons for her. The breakfast was excellent and again staff quickly knew your name and you felt more of a friend or family member. We ate in the restaurants two nights, had drinks outside by the pool and the quality was excellent so was the value  From the thoughtful - your leaving early so we have packed a breakfast box for you - to the delightful - its"
"The hotel is at par and there is no match to its ambiance and feel. Rooms and all are very nice, but the food being served is losing its Indian touch. The food in all the restaurants are prepared looking at the taste for foreign tourist and so the richness and spiciness of even Indian foods are compromised"
Great experience all around. Staff are terrific and exceptionally helpful. I travel a lot and this is one of the nicest places I have stayed. The staff go out of there way to be helpful. We ran into an issue with our tour operator and the hotel arranged the tour in 10 minutes and at a lower cost than we had arranged on line in advance. Again the service here was exceptional and this is only one example.
"Outstanding service in a superbly maintained hotel in a prime location. We were impressed with the staff at all levels in terms of their efficiency and friendliness. Our room was very well appointed, clean and comfortable. The range of optional tours arranged through the hotel were impressive, well conducted by highly knowledgeable guides and provided us with a great overview of local history, architecture and lifestyles in the surrounding region."
"There are two types of people in this world - those who have stayed at Taj and those who haven't. I crossed over to the former group recently and discovered the fabulous and mesmerizing things that make people return here again and again. It's not the comfortable bed, the great view, the fascinating history, the alluring palace interiors, the best pool in the city or the delicious food at one of the umpteen restaurants/bars in this place. It is is the surprising personal touch that you are often subjected to from every person who works here that turns you into a lifelong fan. The person who drops you to your room and introduces the place to you, the housekeeping which adorns petals in your bathroom, the guest services which always addresses you by your name and fulfills almost"
"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in October 2015 while attending a conference at the same hotel and I had a great time. On arrival my reception was very warm and I was immediately upgraded from a city view room to an Ocean view room in the Palace wing of the hotel overlooking the Arabian sea. Awesome view! Courteous staff! The room was clean and the bed extremely comfortable. The surroundings by the residents only poolside restaurant are absolutely amazing. Indian food at the Masala Craft was really good and the Jiva spa at the hotel is a must try for spa lovers.  On check out however, the lady at the reception said I was yet to pay for my room when I had paid for this with a debit card on arrival. I immediately brought out my receipt and this was resolved quickly but I"
"If you want to visit Mumbai in a luxurious way, the Taj is probably the place to be From reception to diner and the room, everything is perfect. All comfort available. A choice is available between several restaurants. Lunch area at the pool reminds you of the old English days. The pool is large. Also there service is offered on simple demand. The room was not the biggest ever but it contains all you need. The bathroom has everything. Small minor point is the internet with limited speed."
"A truly great hotel experience. We stayed in the old part of the hotel. Beautiful building, fine art, atmosphere, acoustics, fantastic service! Worth the trip to Mumbai in itself. An oasis in the middle of the fascinating and incredible Mumbai."
"This beautiful, historic building was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The ambience and service was spot on.  We took a room in the palace wing. I am not sure I would have been quite so 'gushing' had we booked for the Tower. But who knows?! Our sea view room overlooked the Gateway to India. Like just outside of our window - not a speck in the distance! The room was spacious, and the bed extremely comfortable. The crisp cotton sheets were the height of luxury. So many excellent touches. Little surprises left in the room - bath oil, rose petals.....and  a birthday cake for my husband. We had not informed the hotel of this celebration - impressive how they must have picked up on this. Nothing was too much trouble. Service was delivered in a quiet genuine manner.  The"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a wonderful hotel. It is kept in superb condition and all the staff are friendly, well trained and knowledgeable. We visited another 5* hotel for dinner one evening and whilst it was beautiful and the food excellent it just didn't have the style of the Taj Mahal Palace. I have no hesitation in recommending it. Thank you to all concerned for a wonderful stay."
"Amazing hotel where every little details is solved with efficiency and care. The surroundings are simply amazing, and the hotel building is like a dream. As a guest everybody takes care of making every single moment special serving and caring you with attention and love. Restaurants and shopping centers are great and the spa yoga classes are amazingly special and intense."
"5 star all the way....truly an iconic luxury experience! A true palace with the finest service you can imagine. The service impeccable, the room well appointed, eye candy everywhere...and the best surprise was at turndown they had framed a picture of my dog back home and left it on my nightstand....incredible details!"
"No doubt about the reputation and services. One of the best in class and tradition. Good care and comfort in stay, staff  Well caring and helpful all the time. Thanks to Mr. Jagat at front desk for making our Trip memorable for our children. Will certainly look forward To stay here if time permits. No doubt a good value of money"
"It was my husband's birthday and I decided to gift him a stay at Taj. I booked a room in the tower and got a complimentary upgrade to the palace wing. We were welcomed with 'Tilak' and 'Tulsi Mala'. The check-in was quick and we got complimentary juice and fruit basket. Room was quite well done and plush. We had a view of the swimming pool. We also attended the 45 minutes heritage tour of the hotel. Every inch of the 100-year-old property had a story to tell. With M.F Hussain's painting to the grand staircase to intricately crafted ticketing window, every piece of decor had some significance. The staff was also sweet to arrange for a balloon decoration in the room, a complimentary cake and flowers. Buffet breakfast by the gateway of India at sea lounge was also amazing. Overall,"
Everything since we arrived until we left was perfect. It is the best hotel in Mumbai for both leisure and business. The hotel is beautiful and the service outstanding. The location is perfect too. Will definitely recommend to anyone traveling to Mumbai.
The Taj Mahal Palace is a must Hotel to stay in Mumbai it takes you to another place of perfect service and very professional and welcoming staff.  The Food is wonderful in the Dragon restaurant and as well breakfast by the side on the Marine drive is really nice.  They take of little details such as when we were leaving to the Airport they have put different temperature water bottles to suit all of us :) . This attention to details has really made this experience amazing.
"The Taj is an iconic hotel.  Just staying in it is a pleasure.  The design, architecture and decoration make you feel good as you walk around the hotel. The staff however upstaged the hotel.  They were fantastic, so attentive and aware when they could step in and improve the experience.  I will never forget he girl in breakfasts reply to my question,""how did you know my name"".  She replied, because you are a very important person! My colleague and I had a great stay, enjoyed the cognac and chocolates in the Palace lounge and will bore people about it for years."
Outstanding hotel.  Excellent security for anyone concerned give a few years ago.  Clearly a 5 star in every category.  Rooms were beautifully furnished and lavish.  Restaurants were excellent.  Attention to every detail as expected.
"The Taj hotel its truly world class and stands above most places ive had the pleasure to stay. The service levels are second to none. Wonderful experience. The lobbies, restaurants and staff make the place to stay on any visit to Mumbia"
" The entire place is majestic, opulent and just wow. I was directed to the lounge and given a guava mocktail while waiting to be attended. Thereafter I was brought to my room and had my check- in processed at my comfort. My room has been upgraded! The front- desk was attentive and friendly, likewise for the housekeeping and concierge staff. I had asked where I could get a lip balm for my chapped lips and he offered to send one to my room. I was in awe when I saw this gift on my bed. Love the words ""At The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai our greatest treasure is to make our guests smile. This is why we have specially packaged the perfect blend of kokum butter and honey to soften and hydrate your lips. We hope this in itself gives you reason enough to smile."" Well, I am sold. smiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyessmiling_face_with_heart-eyes For"
"Although I have visited Mumbai many times in the past this is the first opportunity I have had to stay at the Taj. An outstanding hotel with excellent food and facilities, the staff are extremely friendly and nothing is too much trouble, very high quality standards. It is also located in an ideal location to be able to wonder around Mumbai and see this wonderful city. I look forward to my next visit."
"one of the best hotels that i have stayed in till today. I think i have been there thrice and i never get bored of the place. the reason is that that place is so nice, You should take a room in the middle floor which also has the outside view and the outside view should be the sea. you can enjoy in room in the evening with a drink and looking at the sea and enjoying its beauty"
What can you say it it the best hotel the service is an absolute joy the staff were attentive but not intrusive I cannot think how they could possibly make it better. You must choose one of the heritage rooms so you are in the main hotel.
"On request I was allotted a Sea view room at the Palace wing, hence enjoyed a beautiful view of Gateway of India and the Harbour along side, Excellent Room service, Grand Hospitality very Polite and Helpful Staff (full marks to them) Food at Masala Kraft was OK, but that is due to the catering of International Guests too, In short a day spent there is an Affair to Remember."
we had a beautifull room with a view on the gate of India. The hotel is very comfortable and clean and the service is very good. Prices are high but the quality is fine. The staff is a bit formal but very helpfull. Very nice restaurants and shops...
"The staff were very helpful, it is not cheap but we treated ourselves as we were on our honeymoon. The hotel upgraded us to a room overlooking the bay and they had decorated our room with balloons and rose petals, and when we got back in the evening the team had left a very nice chocolate cake for us.  The Taj is genuinely amazing, a welcome respite from the city outside!"
"I have used this property for so long that I seem to have forgotten exactly, how many years it is.I recall having dealt with atleast half dozen GMs!There is an enduring charm about the place which makes one over look the absence of drive way or indeed the huge lawns which some of its name sakes have.I have witnessed changes in some of the restaurants;moving of the Business Lounge to the ground floor and more.In each case it has kept pace with the times elegantly."
"I enjoyed the stay very nice well kept hotel, friendly staff and delecious food . what else you want from a hotel like Taj. i will strongly recommend to stay and enjoy hospitality and it is opposite  to Gateway of India  ."
"We stayed here for two nights at the start of our Golden Triangle tour of India. From our arrival until our departure we were made to feel very special, nothing was to much trouble for the staff who went the extra mile to make our stay comfortable. Having seen many photographs, and given its history we expected the hotel to be 'special' .However, photographs do not do the hotel justice, it needs to be seen to get the wow factor.   The room was exceptionally clean and well furnished, there is an extensive breakfast menu however, to avoid a queue at breakfast it is best to go early as it gets very busy!  The food in the restaurants, as one would expect, is exceptional.  The pool area is very pleasant oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Certainly a must visit hotel if"
"As usual and for ever and ever TAJ IS TAJ - No comments and no comparision.Its a LEGACY. The Ambience , Service , Warm Welcome , the view both city and the sea excellent. The joy in service with a friendly + humble touch makes us cool"
"I didn't stay here but was there for 2 full days on 28th and 29th Sep for a Convention. This was my first visit to this Hotel and I was simply awestruck with its beauty, its Grandeur and everything about it to which I had an access as a Convention visitor. I had the privilege of spending time in their ""Crystal Room"" for Convention and ""Ball Room"" for Dinner. Great experience and hope to stay here one day."
I suggest everyone to have experience in this hotel. You will understand what is customer delight from the stay there. make your stay comfortable with out any fuzzy calls from the front desk or too much of noises
best hotel in mumbai best location.food is great amazing interiors and perfect rooms.staff is very friendly.i stayed there for 3 days and everything was just perfect.its like living in a piece of history.once again amazing food 5 stars.
"We stayed here for just one night to celebrate a special occassion. We live in Mumbai yet staying at this iconic property was on the bucket list & am glad we did it. Our room was in the new wing on the 18th floor with a mesmerizing view. The rooms look a bit dated and could do with a renovation but that is not a big concern. We had lunch at the Shamiana & also at the poolside lounge. Missed going to the Sea Lounge for high tea, have to go back for it. We also used the babysitter one evening and our son was very happy to stay with her."
"Amazing staying at the hotel. including the great staff and the quality of the facilities. The food is very good, but not value for money. Very good experience to end the trip to India at the Taj Mahal Palace!"
"Stayed with family on the occasion of my wife's birthday.. Room is good & all other services are also good.. But big disappointed in terms of F&B staffs Services & attitude. We had a Dinner at Shamiana around 9:30pm (3 pax) after that my friends came to celebrate my wife's birthday.. we were all together 12 pax.. 8 adults n 4 children.. we once again entered @Shamiana Restaurant around 10:45 the lady n captain told us.. wait for 30 mins as they don't have table for 12.. there was some small tables were available, we requested them to join the table.. but they refused and suggested us that "" why don't u try Sea Lounge"" although in Shamiana half the section was empty. When  told them to open that section the manager or.captain told me there they have done paiting so that section"
I could not have asked for better during my 4 day stay. The very caring and personal service was very much appreciated. Well done to all the Team at the Taj Mahal and I would have not hesitation recommend you and will certainly stay with you when next in Mumbai.
This hotel was the perfect location.The hotel was clean with a really large room and very comfy double bed.we stay here for Two nights. location is perfect for family vacation.The hotel was beautiful and the view was awesome.
"If you are on a visit to Mumbai this has to be on your list of places to stay, you will never regret that decision. The hotel is iconic. Its combination of old world charm and impeccable modern facilities and service cannot be bettered. The hotel stay are a delight and there is nothing that is too much trouble for them in making your stay exactly what it should be. Id upgrade to the club membership as the benefits are well worth the extra outlay that will make your stay truly memorable."
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel has an excellent location and the building is very nice but smaller than expected. The strong points include a comfortable room, excellent housekeeping, a very good breakfast buffet and generally attentive staff. The breakfast staff in particular are excellent. The hotel also arranged a car for me to go to Bandra and the car and driver were both very good. There was a walking tour too although the guide didn't seem to know much about the architecture or history of the buildings and mainly told anecdotes. The downsides were first of all I was booked onto a floor where they were doing construction/maintenance, and when I tried to take photographs in the building I was hassled by security and regular staff on two different occasions. It was particularly"
"This hotel is just amazing.  We visited a few years ago.  We only spent one night there because their pool was closed when we visited and we really wanted a pool.  The manager was very accommodating to us and sent us to one of their other hotels and provided the transportation.   We thought this was excellent customer service.   We explored all around this hotel, there is so much beauty to see and so many beautiful rooms and halls. The rooms were nice,  a little smaller than we thought,  but so nice.  A short walk from the hotel there are many shops and street vendors so that was nice to walk around there and do some shopping.  "
Made to feel like a princess from the time we were fetched from the airport..all the way to the Taj..n the royal traditional welcome the moment we stepped into Taj..our room balcony opened to one of the best views ever.. The Gateway of India..watched the changing colors of the sunrise on it every morning..the staff greets u with a smile n makes u feel so at home..breakfast at Shamiana felt like walking into mum's kitchen..awsum..!! The travel desk particularly Mukesh assisted me in booking train tickets..loved the heritage walk organised by Taj..our guide Jyoti was witty n made every step we walked worthwhile..the piano recitation every night at the lobby was like walking down memory lane..from the security to the duty manager upon our check out..i was made to feel like a
I have really enjoyed staying in Taj Mahal Palac. The staff were really kind and welcoming. their security measures at the entrance really made me feel safe in staying in the hotel. i will stay with them again next time i visit Mumbai.
"This is definitely the best Hotel I have ever stayed in. I was upgraded to the Palace wing  which initially I was not happy since i wanted a sea facing top floor. But once I was taken to my room, I changed my mind. I still had a view of the sea AND i was on the historic Palace wing. This place has been completely refurbished after what happened some years back ( the infamous terrorist attack). The staff in the Hotel were so nice. I just did not find any flaws. Maybe the only flaw I can think of was the pool water which was bit milky and not clear..but certainly not dirty. The 30 meter pool was a dream for a serious swimmer like me. All in all a very enjoyable 2 night stay. A sad thing happened on my check out. I had bought some chocolates which I had picked up in NY for my son"
"One of the best hotels in Mumbai and India, The TajMahal Palace and Tower is a plush 5-star hotel that offers world class amenities, classy architecture, matchless comfort and a regal style. It provides an excellent option for business and leisure travelers who are looking for superior service and hospitality. Situated at the water's edge at Gateway of India, Mumbai; TajMahal Palace and Tower is close to some of the elite business areas of Mumbai, while also providing access to the rest of the city. One of the finest boutique hotels in the city, the TajMahal Palace and Tower offers a regal ambience and spa facilities to its guests. Banquet services are ideal for holding social as well as corporate events. The hotel provides round-the-clock room service, front desk and security"
"My Mum and I stayed at The Taj in September during our 4 night stay in Mumbai. The Taj Mahal Palace has such an amazing reputation and history - we didn't really consider staying anywhere else - so we were very happy that it lived up to our high expectations!  We were made to feel very welcome the minute we arrived, despite it being the middle of the night after a long flight, and were delighted when we were told we had been given a free room upgrade to the Palace! The staff, in general, are faultless - every single one will greet you as you walk past and nothing is too much trouble. The little touches of personalised surprise gifts and having a new flower arrangement everyday in your room is what makes this hotel so special; you're made to feel like the guest of honour. Also,"
Ecellent from every aspect of view.  Very courteous and friendly staff.   Cleanliness is top.  Flower arrangement in room is something I have not experienced in any other hotel. I do not have 200 characters to describe the quality and service in this hotel.   Saying excellent every where describes everything
"Summer of 2003, I set my foot first time in Maya nagari n was amazed with the architecture of The Taj; guide just kept telling us all the lies n myths n facts ; that day I decided to visit The Taj. Yes, it took me 12 years; though I wish I shouldn't have visited The Taj. Heart broken to say that my stay was not at all aligned with what I had thought of.May be I had expected too much from them or The Oberoi people had raised the bar so high that The Taj people were not able to meet or that system glitch which changed my room I received booking confirmation for .  I was assigned city facing club room instead of sea facing , n it took 5 hours untill I checked in to the room I paid for. The duty managers concluded that assigned room was as per my booking untill I sought help of "
"The stay was comfortable , staff is co-operative , some entertainment  zone was  missing , quality of food is good  but  little price higher as compare to  other hotels location is at the end as have to travel a lot from air port  take at least 1.30 hours  from airport"
This is best hotel in india.when i was visited this place.that was a best experience  in my hole life.people are so nice.staff also very obeying.i adivse to every one who goes India visit this place at leas one time....
"From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave, the lovely hotel staff will ensure that your stay is up to the standard you want and even more.  The staff are very friendly, always saying Good morning, hello, how are you etc ( very well spoken english)   We opted for the deluxe room which was on the 17th floor overlooking the Gateway of India. As we visited this hotel for my friends birthday, i was in contact with the hotel way before our arrival asking if they could offer anything complimentary for her birthday. They set the room out lovely by adding in a foot spa, rose petals on the bed, cushions saying congratulations as both of us were celebrating graduation as well. They also made my friend a cake and offered a complimentary Mehndi session to us both.  The room itself"
"It is hard not to be impressed by the history and luxury of this landmark hotel.  On arrival I was given an upgrade to a Taj Suite which was a pleasant surprise.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the butlers who were fantastic.  My only negative was the quality of the wifi as it kept dropping out and not automatically reconnecting.  Other than that small issue it was a wonderful stay."
"My wife and myself stayed at a sea facing club room with club lounge facilities from the 11-14th September, 2015.   The service everywhere was absolutely brilliant, the best we have encountered at any of the Taj properties.    Breakfast at the Sea Lounge was fantastic.  The quality of food was top notch as was the service.   The Zodiac Grill was unique with Dominic and Castro outstanding.  Souk is excellent as is the Golden Dragon.  Masala Kraft serves food from different parts of India in tiffin form or ala carte or a set menu.  The buffet brunch at the Shamiana was a bit of let down.  Perhaps our expectations were too high.   The club room we were in overlooked the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea.  We could watch the sunrise every morning.  Amenities in the room were"
Booked 3 nights to stay at this hotel.  Service was fantastic. Breakfast at sea lounge was first class. Manager Pradeep Singh made sure we were looked after each morning. Room was beautiful. Attention from staff awesome. Experience so enjoyable we booked 3 extra nights. Would highly recommend this hotel.
"What a great hotel! Location, service, elegance, history, restaurants etc... Definitely one of the best hotels I have ever stayed.   Even the hotel has suffered a tragedy back in 2008 it is a wonderful place I will certainly return to."
"After over 35 years of traveling all over the world for school, work and leisure, my wife and I discovered what is the best hotel in which we were paying guests.  While the rooms in the Tower Wing were good and the facility is in good shape, it is the staff and how they take care of us that made the real difference.  The hotel's Jaguar with both a white gloved driver and the airport representative was waiting to greet us upon our arrival into Mumbai from Bahrain.  Our hotel greeting was very personalized with the room prepared very well for our one week stay.  The food choices were excellent and we enjoyed many of the bars and restaurants while at the hotel.  We also took advantage of the spa and salon services...as well as the pool.  Also, we utilized the hotel's car fleet to"
Stayed here for 2 nights and got a magnificent view of the Gateways of India and the sunrise. The hospitality shown by the hotel staffs is second to none. The Heritage Trail organized by the hotel is fantastic. My only grouse is that the bathrooms could do with a little modern look. A hand held shower and a bidet would have been perfect.
"All over experience during the stay is excellent, the quality of food is awesome, The staff is very supportive an helpful. the sea side view of the palace is quite good rather the city view. allover the experience is awesome"
Thank you very much for the wonderful experience.  Everybody made our trip memorable and look forward to returning again soon.  We were upgraded to the Palace room which was exceptional.  Highly recommend this hotel to all.
"the hotel is perfect, very good location, delicious breakfast. we arrive early in the morning and and we where given a room strait away, and they made us and upgrade to a wonderful room in the palace wing. The garden and swimming pool is very welcome in hot days."
"My experience at the hotel was majestic! The regal architecture, rich decor, luxurious linen, tasty food, professional staff and lemon scented air delighted all my senses. The view of the Gateway of India from the palace is spectacular. I highly recommend winding down at the pool side in the evening listening to the bustle of the city - it's enchanting."
"We stayed for a week at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai, a decision we made after watching the BBC documentary. The hotel was a true 5 star luxury experience. From arrival at the airport where the chauffer was waiting to take us to the hotel, until we departed a week later. The staff were attentive and could not do enough for us,and had exceptional customer service skills. The room was amazing the food in the Zodiac Grill was a true dinning experience. We loved this hotel would definitely recommend a stay there and we will be returning next year."
"The Taj Palace Mumbai is for me, still the best all round hotel in Mumbai - the history, the staff  and quality are excellent. I've stated in a few other properties before and after the terrorist attacks and this remains my favourite Mumbai hotel. Yes, eating in the hotel is expensive compared to outside, and there are fantastic restaurants elsewhere; but you are paying for the setting and service etc. The swimming pool is in a beautiful garden haven, and up to 10ft deep. SPA down steps from pool. An example of the little touches from staff - my book and specs were left on the bedside table in the morning, I returned later to find a bookmark and specs cleaner cloth beside them. Recommended !!"
Had a well spent vacation. Totally enjoyed the stay and the facilities.  Well maintained swimming pool and had a great breakfast .Room service was excellent. Butlers and room service managers were ensuring we are comfortable with the stay and if we had any complaints.
Stayed at the taj palace over a weekend for a day to day break .  The most royal way to get away from the rush and grind  of Mumbai without leaving the city !!! Would also recommend the Tajin at the souk
"A stay at the Taj Mumbai Palace is to stay in THE lap of luxury, best experience ever.  I feels like being at a family residence, staff are fantastic, location in the middle of the action.  Can't wait to get back!!"
"We ate at the Indian specialty restaurant yesterday and it has been a terrible experience.   The staff never smiled, hardly acknowledged us. We decided what to eat and after we ordered 2 times 2 assorted starters, the waiter said it would be too much for us, we were 4. The price of the appetisers which these were, was absolutely ridiculous, being priced at 2000+ inr per starter for the non veg.   The service was slow, even though the restaurant was practically empty. The waiter pushed the chicken dish about 3 times but didn't care on checking whether we liked the food.   When we told him whether he could serve the yoghurt we ordered for going by the naan bread earlier, it still took 5 minutes to make the yoghurt...   As my colleagues and me are working in the f&b industry, we"
"it is good,i saw only from outside as i was having an appointment still if a person can recomend it from seeing it outside than if i would get an opputunity to see it from inside i would  say it is heaven"
This is one hotel one would look forward to stay. It has a history and the ultimate Indian hospitality to match that great history. The exquisite location across gateway of India and the monumental building is the hallmark. However I had a bad experience. In my room I could hear the snoring of the person in the next room and that disturbed me throughout the night. Ensure you do not take up a room which is a Family twin room set turned into two separate room which does not offer you even sound privacy. Rest of the stay was excellent.
"The iconic Taj Mahal Hotel is located in Bombay opposite another landmark, The Gateway of India, facing the Arabian Sea. If you are in the hotel, a meal or coffee at the coffee shop called The Shamiana is a must."
The hotel provided us a complimentary upgrade  in rooms and  the breakfast we had was amazing with great service. However food is liitle bit overpriced. The hotel is located at a prime location. It was a memoriable stay
It is rare when a hotel blows your expectations out of the water but this is exactly what happened at The Taj Mahal Palace. We stayed in a club room in the palace wing. I would highly recommend this option. The palace wing is beautifully maintained and had a wonderful sense of history to it. By staying in a club room we had a complimentary transfer from the airport which was a great start. In room check in is most welcomed and 24 butler service puts the icing on the cake. Access to the palace lounge is also very relaxing with attentive service. All in all I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough and by spending a little more to stay in a club room itch sea view in the palace wing was money well spent. 
Fantastic location in Mumbai. A really luxery hotel. Nice and friendly staff. The pool in the evening was magic and the spa a nice place after the pool. However restaurant prices are western level although the food is very good. Taxi transfer from Airport was also western prices but ofcourse clean and with friendly drivers.
"I have been coming to this hotel since I was a child. It was the most exciting thing to run up the stairs to The Sea Lounge and be allowed to eat ice cream whilst looking at The Gateway of India.  I now eat their sev batata puri or better still their HUGE Sunday tea. All the major events in my family have been celebrated and held at The Taj. My grandparents' Golden Wedding party, my wedding night... I feel like I'm home whenever I am there.  The staff are superbly attentive and knowledgable and the Poolside is one of the most relaxing places to be in Bombay."
"Excellent hotel of this class and kept extremely clean. Front desk staff is very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast area is spacious and one of the best in a Mumbai I have experienced. Fresh fruit (strawberries, blueberries, oranges, apples, and bananas) in addition to all the other hot and cold items.   I actually stayed here for the first time and room was very nice and spacious . I'll be back to this place and highly recommend to others when in the area."
Best service I have received in a hotel in India.  I arrived 8:00 in the morning and they allow us to have early check in plus a free upgrade of the room. all the experience was excellent as you should expect from any hotel of the taj group
Ultimate experience..... Rooms are luxurious....... High quality facility...... It's costly but value for money.....amenities are very nice n memorable..... Once in life must visit....feel like heavenly......people are caring in nature....
"My colleagues and I stayed for a short while but our stay was comfortable, nice pool and patio, nice food and service, very well located to do visits by foot and take the boat to Elephanta island. Only down point is that during Ganesh festivals or other cultural activities, rooms are not well equipped and noise is still present."
the taj mahal palace hotel mumbai has always been one the best hotels on my list. the iconic hotels offers you a lot more than you must have even thought of. the peace and serenity in the complex is great. the warm staff is excellent. they hospitality is to a different level. the pool area is supposed to be the best part of the hotel. the view of the dome from the pool area is mesmerizing. all in all i would conclude by saying that is a must visit property if you are in India.
"I have stayed at the Taj many times, but this year brought my husband for our anniversary. The hotel staff fill our room with balloons and flowers, and many additional touches.  The sense of care of the staff in all parts of the hotel redefines hospitality.  I am a US citizen living in the UK.  We frequently cite the US as understanding hospitality, but I can assure you, this is world-leading."
Stunning building from afar but even more incredibly when up close so that you can see the intricate carvings. They use precious and semi-precious stones to decorate this building. It is fantastic. The gardens are lovely. This visit will not be an anti-climax. 
We visited the taj  mahal palace in Mumbai in april and stayed in the palace wing. What  a beautiful hotel and awesome rooms. Nothing was too much trouble. Will definitely be  going back. The service and food was second to no other hotel that we have ever stayed in. The staff were waiting for us to arrive and took us to a private room to book in. Definitely the best hotel in India and so far the best in all we have visited and have stayed in so many great hotels but so far nothing compares to the taj.
"Sigh..  Only had a night's stay here.. Sadly..   There are hotels.  Then there's the Taj Mahal Palace that makes everything else looks more like a ho(e)tel.   It's not hospitality, it's history you are experiencing here.    The property - Be it a walk through the property or take the fun heritage tour. You are busy trying to cram your mind with as many images and stories (because selfies would be oh so uncool here).   Rooms though small were very well laid out and mighty comfortable. The ones with the view of the Gateway are obviously wayyy better than the ones with the 'Dharavi' view.   Food was not 9 star like the rest of the hotel but was still OK.   Service - to die for (quite literally, as historians might point out)   The staff - the best..  Enough said..   Wandering in"
"Its an experience of staying in a Taj palace.  No one can beat the hospitality, friendly staff, nice location, nice view.  One of the best palaces in the world.  Strongly recommended if you are in Mumbai"
"If you want to be pampered, loved, valued, taken care . . . than there can't be none other better place than to visit the taj group of hotels. The hotel staff are highly courteous and extremely perfect in all there activities, so just check in and leave the rest to the experts to be taken care about :)"
"This is the best hotel that i have ever experienced. Hospitality was redefined by Taj as this was the first time i experienced a Taj Stay.  Seemless check in , special attention to a child guest and warm and very freindly staff  are one of the few pointers which i would like to highlight beyond the property itself which is magnificient!  Had a wonderful time....Cheers!"
from arrival to departure first class experience. friendly and very helpful staff in all the restaurants. our room was clean and the staff were attentive to our requests. we had our few weeks old grandson with us and his needs were attended to. The Chefs at sea lounge for breakfast met all our requests and introduced us to many  tasty local specialities. The Aquarius lounge and the Palace lounge were relaxed and great places to be. The Golden Dragon resteraunt was very popular with us and family.
So I have stayed here over 30 years .as child of 9 and a adult of 50 something . They go out of there way to make you fell special . The last time I was walking thru the lobby and was giving a cloth to clean my glasses .
"This is truly one of the best on the world, if not the best.  A real retreat from the crazy world outside the hotel but not completely removed from it, which makes this one of the best city experiences you can have.  Would definitely visit again and recommend to all!"
"Another wonderful, relaxing stay at our favourite hotel in the world - and I do a lot of travelling. Away from all the blitz and repetitive glamour of these new or boutique hotels, the Taj Mahal oozes colonial comfort round every corner. Its simply wonderful - staff, service, comfort and tradition."
"Truly an experience of staying in a Palace. Staff courteousness, well behaved, very supportive, making you feel like a king. The welcome itself is very special. Feel the Opulence. Food was well served, good and the spread was good.  This is a world famous Hotel and it just opposite to Gate way of India. Just outside when you step out you can find the Arabian Sea. Worth .....the feel of luxury and comfort."
"It was a pleasure to see this world famous building which is a great land mark in Mumbai, restored to its old glory after all the bad things that happened,even if you don't stay there worthwhile just visiting & looking at the place due to its historic significance."
"When you first walk in to The Taj Mahal Palace, it's the aroma that will get you hooked.  The opulence is something out of a dream. The staff are well dressed,  friendly and accommodating.  There is an air about the Taj you only see in an old black and white movie.  A profusion a flowers brings about a feeling of being in a botanical garden.  What a fantastic time we had."
"My wife, son and daughter-in law went to the Taj Palace to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday. Nothing will be more memorable. Starting witth the reception , the rooms overlooking the Gateway Of India, the complimentary champagne,the towel rolled into a small puppy , the bed filled with heart shaped baloons - all this was fantastic and will always remain with us."
"Spent a few days here and was an amazing hotel,   - service is as you would expect, but feels more - The breakfast buffet was very generous in diversity of food - The massage from I house spa was amazing and probably best I've ever had - and great value - room was very comfy and good view over the gateway of India   Looking forward to next stay at a Taj"
"I had the pleasure of spending two nights at the Taj Mahal Palace and enjoyed every minute of it. Great staff, amazing restaurants and really nice room.  I stayed on the palace side and didn't want to leave.  I would come back to this Gem the very next time I can.   staff, "
"I stayed here for 2 nights and one night at the oberoi. The facilities are amazing here, the staff very friendly and we had the ocean view was great, unfortunately I didn't stay at the old classical side. The location is very central, close to the shops and food. Alot of the famous celebrities and sport stars stayed here. Saw couple of the sport stars staying here. The breakfast was fresh and really nice. The security to get in it was extremely tight, but understandable considering the location."
"A hotel full of history well worth a visit. Mumbai now has many other newer hotels to choose from but not with is history. Rooms are limited to 2 people so we had to take a second room for our daughter, which was expensive. Good choice of Restuarants in house and prices were reasonable. Great staff with fantastic attention to detail. With traffic in Mumbai, it is quiet a trek from the airport and from the hotel back into centre of the city."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is the finest and most elegant hotel in Mumbai. The hotel has a wonderful view of the city's landmark - The Gateway of India. I stayed there for a weekend and really enjoyed the experience. The Habour Bar offers some lovely drinks. If you are looking for a hotel in the heart of the city, Taj Mahal Palace will be a great choice! "
"I have been to several Taj hotel but must say The Taj Mahal palace, Mumbai has something different in it....I was lucky to get upgraded for room in Palace wing....hotel has more then 100 year old history, its architecture & design, its rooms/facilities & many restaurants with different cuisines to offer....It is true for me that I always get value for money or I get more than what i pay...."
"It looks hotel was closed since many months or even years, the room allotted to me was having wet foul smell, whole night on the arrival day I was not able to sleep, I complaint the same to Hotel front desk and they committed to change the hotel room which was not done when I reached in Hotel in evening.  This was my unplanned visit to Mumbai and hence no prior booking was done by me that day and I feel Hotel took advantage of this and allotted a worst room in the Hotel.  I am a chronic asthma patient, after leaving Mumbai since last 3 days I am not able to join office due to respiratory problem due to wet foul smell of the room where I stay.  I humble request you to please don't allot a room in such a condition and don't play with guests health."
"Hotel location: South of Mumbai, in an expensive area, traffic is crazy around here but then again whole of mumbai has crazy traffic. Located right next to iconic Gateway of India   Hotel access : Easily accessible and go through a thorough security checks upon arrival. Lots of shopping around the area( but expensive )  Hotel staff : excellent staff, upon arrival greeted with a warm smile and all the staff around the hotel spoke very well and was very informative.   Check in process : Nice and easy, what you would expect from a five star hotel.  Hotel room : we stayed at deluxe king room with sea views, excellent views of the gateway of India   Room cleanliness : For the price you pay, rooms are outdated. Carpets looks old and the amenities are somewhat standard. Had clean"
Instantly memorable.   We will be back as often as we can afford.  Must try the old wing next and beggar the cost.  The public areas are like walking through a magnificent movie set.  Constantly expecting a Princess or a Hero around the next corner.  And the cocktail bar (and its Specials) surely has a Villain or two about to do a dire deed or so.  A Bucket-List winner.  Many thanks for the experience.
"Staying at the Taj is entering a world of gracious service. The myriad of fine dining options range will delight anyone, as will the room service that we used as an alarm clock, it was so punctual. Sitting by the pool in the afternoon provided a respite from the Indian sun, and we were greetted with a smile and chilled water at every turn. The Spa treatments are top-notch. We had a reflexology that made my feet feel like new! (at leadt for a few days) When in Mumbai, we will always stay at the Taj!"
"The rooms were beautiful, the decor thoughtfully done. The food was also great, with quite a range to choose from. I loved the fresh fruit and flowers in the room. But best of all was the excellent service from everyone who works at the Taj. Keep it up!"
"It's an experience - you have not lived if you have not stayed at 'Hotel India'. As always, the genuine lovely staff make your stay special as always. It's the little things - I ran out of rupees and the Head Concierge gave a cash out of his own wallet for my taxi to the airport. Guess I will have to visit again soon to repay this...."
The service is amazing but anything you want or order are really over priced.  Rest its a hotel like any other hotel. Must visit the evening hotel tour. The internal decoration is amazing and they spend huge money maintaining it
"A dream come true, which in itself is self-explanatory of what was on out of the world experience. From the time I called the hotel regarding our reservation to when we arrived and then, what was a seamless departure; the length of our stay and associated interactions; an ever smiling, most attentive-cum-understanding staff; and sentiment the hotel leaves you with - is unparalleled. I trust Taj Mahal Palace to remember me and ensure the same and/or a similar experience next time, too. :)"
"Upon my arrival at the hotel, I was greeted to a security gate and many guards in front of the reception doors. This is normal, I though, due to the previous bombings on the hotel. That wasn't too bad, I did feel a little bit uncomfortable though. Anyway, we were given complimentary drinks and we're assisted and informed about all the necessary information about the hotel and its stores and spas etc. The lady that assisted us was very friendly. The check in was quite a timely process,  I do understand it was peak season and it was busy but they can improve on that. The entire hotel is decorated exquisitely and is absolutely amazing. The whole hotel, which is in the hub of the city, seems ands if it's not there. In the middle of the hotel, there is a huge swimming pool and"
"The iconic hotel is fabulous combination of heritage and comfort. The location is breathtaking with balcony overlooking the sea.A and the Gateway of India. The room size are big with all comforts and maintaining the heritage. Staff is extremely courteous and polite. The breakfast is outstanding with a panoramic view of greenery, poolside options etc. The breakfast spread is lavish. An outstanding experience with value for money "
"your uniformed driver will be white-gloved, knowledgeable and wearing a cap. Upon your arrival within site of the Gateway to India archway, you will be greeted, guided through the security process and enter an absolutely beautiful lobby. Take time to stroll through it and admire the design, architecture and art pieces. I doubt here's a bad room in the place, simply ask at the check-in desk for a ""nice room,"" and you'll get one. Arrange for hotel transportation back to the airport when it's time to go. The design and finish of the new international terminal are absolutely breath-taking. I was only there for an overnight stay, and it was memorable."
The hotel is in the heart of the city with a great view of Gate of India. The Staff is very friendly. Traditional welcome by the staff is thrilling. All the restaurants in the hotel have magnificent food. You should at least try to visit all the restaurants to taste food with a drink.
"Taj Mahal Palace hotel is a perfect combination of heritage and luxury. Service is perfect, still polite and courteous. And their after departure should be a benchmark in itsself. Should be one of the best ways to enjoy Mumbai, where you step out of the hotel and land right on the portico of the Gateway of India and the bustling Colaba market. All good things in Colaba within walking distance, this Taj property makes it all possible. All other Taj standards are maintained with additional luxury of direct access to some of the best known restaurants on the city."
"Our stay at Taj was superb. We got upgraded to an Executive Suite; the club lounge amenities was lovely. The hospitality was impeccable, our butler went that extra mile to delight us. Full marks to the entire team."
"I and my family stayed at Taj Mahal Palace for weekend to celebrate my kid's birthday in suit room in palace wing , very good service for in room dinning , excellent hospitality , will remember the day always . suit room great experience . breakfast in sea lounge also very good food variety . taj hotel is truely Royal ."
Its the pride of our Nation Ultimate in hospitality and service A palace where you don't miss home Food is amazing world class cuisines A place for weddings where dreams come true The staff makes you feel like a king and are very polite and co-operative The best hot for comfortable stay where all requirements are well taken care We salute the owners and staff for all their services All My marriages in family was held here and I look forward of holding my Sons marriage here too ver soon Ashok Ahuja
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai. Traditional welcome by the hotel staff is thrilling. Location is superb and great to know the history of the hotel during the walk through of the hotel during evening time. We are thrilled by the surprise gifts for our kid and cake for us. Thanks for memorable stay."
"Beautiful hotel architecture with all the modern comforts. Surprisingly good value for money. Hire a car thru the concierge desk and get a car and driver at a very reasonable rate. The house tea (taj house blend) is really nice. The room was very clean, with simple by striking touches such. As the bright pink and gold coloured bed cover. The hotel has a mini shopping mall attached to it which is very nice. The bakery sells delicious shortbread cookies."
"We went for a Business trip we stayed there for 7 days.  The hotel has lots of restaurants to choose from the service in all of them is expectacular.  The zodiac grill and golden dragon are the best we tried.  For breakfast my special congratulations to Nitesh, made great recommendations and was allways attentive to anything that might be needed. We were first allocated in the regular wing, if you go, you have to stay at the Palace wing, is the old part and it is amazing."
"This hotel is with out doubt the best hotels in Bombay and one of the best in all of India. It is a 19th century treasure full of art, history and old-world luxury. The staff was fantastic, the restaurant and bar great and it is located in the old Portuguese section of Bombay, which still has some of the old world feel to it. It is the one section of Bombay you can walk around in and get a feel for what it was like 100 years ago. The only thing that distracts from this glorious, grande hotel is the tower section. It's design just does not fit with the rest of the hotel. I think they should have built something that would have blended better with the older, more elegant section of the hotel. All things considered, it was a wonderful stay and I give the hotel my highest"
"Great Stay, Awesome Service, particurly the Butler service in executive suite. The complementary add ons in the executive is also great. Hospitality finds its defination here.  I truely recommend this."
An amazing stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all.. Great service. Friendly staff. Good location. Good shopping. The Gateway of India is walking distance and the vibe at night is  busy . Also quite safe to stroll around freely.
"Had Organised a Engagement Function in Taj Mahal Palace,  back in January 2015,  Located exactly opposite the Gateway of India, also Declared heritage building,  One of the luxurious Hotels in the country, with huge ballrooms,  The afternoon bufett was very varied containing indian thai, chinese and midle eastern food. Attention is very good and polite. The afternoon tea was a great surprise at a great price. The room is very well devorated and charming. They have many cakes of all shapes and flavours with plenty of savoury snacks and fresh drinks (hibiscus, lemon, mango, tamarind) and the variety of tea is endless. Just go."
"Very nice hotel. Good Hospitality. The food tastes is lovely, mouth watering. Sea view from rooms add ambience to stay here. I il stay again and again when ever i il visit mumbai for business or personal trip. Staying here is good for comfort. "
"The place is beatiful and quite luxurious throughout. You can enter  and wander around with no one stoping you. The afternoon bufett was very varied containing indian thai, chinese and midle eastern food. Attention is very good and  polite. The afternoon tea was a great surprise at a great price. The room is very well devorated and charming. They have many cakes of all shapes and flavours with plenty of savoury snacks and fresh drinks (hibiscus, lemon, mango, tamarind) and the variety of tea is endless. Just go."
"My wife and I stayed in the old wing of the Taj Mahal Palace and it was pure bliss. I would strongly recommend this hotel for a true luxury experience. In the husle bustle of this concrete city this palatial property is like a breath of fresh air, it exudes the old world charm with all modern comforts. Will visit again for sure."
Wonderful service  . Outstanding food  Felt like home  One of the finest buildings of colonial india  The golden dragon is the finest Chinese food the place is worth a try   The sea lounge is a lovely place overlooking the sea and the beautiful Arabian Sea 
"Any trip to Mumbai- whether for business or leisure can only be greatly enhanced by a visit to or stay at the Taj Palace. I stayed in the Palace wing- which is absolutely gorgeous- the rooms have been newly refurbished and are truly luxurious and chic. The sense of place and legacy of this hotel is beyond words. Great place to relax, eat, sleep, spa, swim, meet, network, shop and more- highly recommend it"
"Taj Mahal Palace truly stands to its name. We had a fantastic stay and not just the hotel and the amenities, the staff were excellent and made our stay truly memorable. Our Baby enjoyed so much especially the dance at 5 PM. Right from Security Guard at the main gate till the Manager in residence, everyone ensured they had smiling faces all through and it was very clear that their objective is to keep you as comfortable as possible."
"Of all the hotels I have ever stayed in, the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is the best. Its location and style are superb and every single member of staff seems to be there to ensure that guests have the best experience possible. Where else in the world does someone put a bookmark in your book for you? Or leave a cloth to polish your glasses? One evening a foot spa had been left out for us, a brass bowl with rose petals and a little pot of spa crystals for the foot wear tourist.  The food was first class and the Club Lounge was a very special touch. Truly it was unique experience."
"While we did not stay at this hotel, our tour group spent several hours in the lobby and having a huge buffet in the restaurant.  The buffet was amazing and had a large assortment of Western and Indian food, all very delicious and so many things to try.  Also a large assortment of fruit and desserts.  If you visit the Gateway to India, this hotel is right across the street and highly recommended for a fantastic lunch buffet."
"The journey towards your destination is the best part of any adventure. It’s those little moments that join together and form a truly memorable experience. It was great experience to interact with Dinesh ji  at the sea lounge restaurant who shared his 44 years of experience at the  Taj Palace hotel.. Also the warm hospitality shared by the Taj group officials - Pradip , Chetan,  Chandresh, Shruti Daruka and Amrita Singh Thanks to all and the entire staff of the hotel for making my trip a memorable one ."
"I just completed my first and last trip to India.  I am so glad that I decided to stay at Taj Mahal palace, so there is at least one nice thing about India I can remember by. Everything about this hotel is nice. I spent most of my 3 days in Mumbai at the pool inside the hotel. I normally do not spend much time in the hotel I stay since I love to experience the local life style. But I was more than happy to just relax at the poolside for three whole days."
"Excellent three night stay celebrating 25th wedding anniversary. Upgrade room, superb food in the restaurants, convenient part of Mumbai to explore,  the staff made the occasion very special with complimentary gifts. Brilliant."
"My friend and I were backpacking for two months.  At Mumbai was almost mid-way through our trip so we decided to treat ourselves to something nicer.  Taj Mahal was absolutely a pleasant experience.  It is probably hands down the best hotel that we have ever stayed at.  We got there late at night in our crappy clothes and well-traveled backpacks, walked into the lobby, and realized that we were completely out of place because everyone else was in their fancy clothes and expensive handbags.  We've had so many free perks while staying here: free room upgrades, free breakfast, free wifi, free afternoon tea, free foot baths, great view of Gate of India from our hotel room, rooms were cleaned probably five times a day, etc."
A truly palacial experience in the midst of the Mumbai Chaos. Its a great experience especially at the palace wing and ocean facing rooms are a must on your first visit.  The restaurants are to die for. A must visit to the oldest 5 star hotel in Mumbai.
"Great stay if you like the good life. Had a room on the 18th floor with a great view. Loved the service and the warmth. The room itself though is starting to age. The paint behind the bathroom door is peeling while the plumbing was being changed during our stay. That said, the courteous staff more than makes up for it. The dinner at Wasabi was ethereal as expected and everyone wishing my wife a happy birthday everywhere we went just made things extra special. Being a Bombay-ite, I'd never really stayed at the famed hotel, and am glad I did."
"Nice place to stay just opposite to gate way of India  Nice hotel with heritage value food is also excellent  Center of the heart , in night you can also go nariman point walking distance   Excellent property"
An excellent stay in one of the best properties of the Taj group which is know to all. Decent professional and courteous staff that makes you feel like you in home. All amenities are just available as soon as you step out of the hotel.
"we had the most wonderful and peaceful stay in our life, being pampered by wonderful staff and taking care of in the best possible way.a treat for the soul! internet accesability at all places made working easy. the knowladgeable help of all the staff members made work a silk like experience. the spa is gorgeous and private, the pool huge and nicely located in a lush garden. one can hear india, see it from the toweroutside and experience it s best in this magic hotel. thank you"
It is one of the most iconic hotel in India....and the staff and service of the hotel makes it even amazing. Right from check in to the check ..oh sorry right from the driver who picks you from the airport ...I stayed at their palace wing room for three nights the view was breathtaking from the window......I was there for work but will definetly revisit the hotel with family. Vishesh at reception and mohsin at poolside cafe..great guys...it's a true TAJ property.
"The Palace is the place to stay in Mumbai,the hotel itself is an historian,the ambience of the rooms and restaurants the food the service..everything is a top notch.an unforgettable experience.in one word TRULY LUXURY."
"When I travel to Mumbai this is my hotel of choice. While the location is not centrally located for business appointments, it is convenient for restaurants and activities in one's free time. Luxurious hotel with a gorgeous setting and pool. pent 2 nights in Mumbai. Hotel staff anticipated every need, exceptionally attentive. Great attention to small details, including slippers delivered at bedtime, lemonade sent to room while exercising in gym. Concierge arranged city tours."

"This is the beat place to stay.The rooms,the ambience, the old world charm , the easy lazy luxury,the attentive unobtrusive staff . I must mention Priyanka at the Palace reception who greeted us so warmly, Ameya our floor butler, Devendra of the Palace Lounge and Simon and John at the Souk made it one of the most memorable stays in my entire life."
Been in India a couple of time and the last time I stayed a couple of days in Taj before and after hitting South  .I fell in love with its history and architecture.The rooms are very old fashioned and some people might find it not pleasant but to me was like a walk in history and a taste of class. The pool was lovely too.The only thing that did not impressed me whatsoever is the reception and host service.They seemed all the time in rush to get rid of you and jumping to another guest although not that busy.Our good friend who is also a member of Taj Group offered to take care of the reservation and payment and although he secure them he was coming over to make the full payment in person when showing the card and ID and meet us the host/receptionist still asked us to make a
"I was there with my wife in April and stayed in the Tower section.   Granted, the rooms, the hotel layout, and the many restaurants were very nice, but this is not why I rated this hotel ""excellent"".    The service was the standout.    They catered to your every whim and knew exactly what you needed (by your previous requests).   Whatever ""customer service"" process they were using... either through selective memory, keeping track of previous orders, or from just reading customers' minds, worked better than any other hotel service I've experienced (no matter the country).    It's the subtle things that stand out for us and you'll find yourself amazed at the level of service that the Taj Mahal Palace provides.   Great location as well.   Recommend a trip through Dharavi if you're"
Checked in 22nd Aug Checked out 28th Aug 2015 Stayed in the Palace Wing room 537 with my wife and daughter.  On Arrivial we quickly passed through security check and entered the Reception Lobby to be met by friendly staff who directed us to the reception counter.  Check in was a breeze and we were personally checked in to our room in under  ten mins from the time entering the establishment till walking into our room.  Throughout our stay at The Taj we were in awe of the exemplary service that the staff provided to us.  Special mention to the following staff members:  Housekeeping : Manohar and Alesh and the rest of the housekeeping team.  Breakfast was the highlight of our stay and will hold forever memories in our hearts at Shamiana.   The following staff members need to be
"Spent a weekend at the iconic Taj with the family with rooms in the heritage wing ( upgraded by the hotel before check in) - a luxurious vacation with great rooms, service,food and everything else, celebrated wife's birthday with surprise arrangements  of cake and champagne made by the staff"
This hotel is beautiful located near the gate of india. It is a top level hotel with a historical background. The old building not modern decorated but if you like this style of hotel it will not disappoint you. Beautiful lounges and areas.
It was all about James Bond so the hotel reminded us of his movie and we loved and enjoyed the whole time there.  The Zodiac Grill was excellent and the the Harbor Bar drinks were amazing. A visit to be repeated for sure.
"We had a wonderful stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai. We highly recommend to stay as it has great location and lovely staff to take care of you. The hotel is superb with variety of restaurants and many things to do locally."
An excellent end to a lovely family holiday to visit friends in India. Having seen the BBC documentary the hotel lived up to it's expectations. Just watch out for the cost of the food and the constant offering of bottled water at a cost.
A great  relaxing staycation. The meet and checkin was wonderful and all smooth. We were upgraded on arrival and had a wonderful room. After a hotel booked tour of Mumbai we came back to a bubble bath and rose petals adorning our room.  The little touches made it a wonderful stay. We will be back..... and definitely for their breakfast!
Staying at the Taj Mahal palace is more like a dream come true. The Heritage wing of the hotel is such so beautiful. My wife & I checked in for a day and dint want to leave. It's highly recommended. The service and hospitality can not be matched by any hotel. By far the best experience.
I've been to many restaurants all around India but could not figure out better than this No where in India could you experience true quality service and customer satisfaction like the Taj Mahal PALACE. Make you feel very welcome and certainly the setting and decor is just superb.   You really feel like a king in this place great rooms and restaurant service the best Indian and European cuisine too.
"The property beckons you to immerse in its 100+ year old heritage, the staff also never misses a chance to make you feel special, all the time. Unsurpassed experience at every stage - check-in, stay, dining. Clearly sets a benchmark!"
"I can very confidently say that my trip and stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai is by far the best experience I have ever had in terms service and quality!!!   The hotel and staff have far exceeded expectations, by miles and I don't think I would ever stay anywhere else every time I visit Mumbai. Every hotel stay going forward will be benchmarked against my experience here, and I am worried that most hotels will fall short.....  It felt special and nothing I write will be able to justify the feeling of complete satisfaction that is still lingering even after returning home. I don't want to say too much, except that you have to stay there and experience it! The service is what made the experience special:)))) This review wont be complete without special thanks going out to: -"
"I had been to Golden Dragon with my fiancee few days back. The food is very decilious. The service is outstanding, staff are very caring with elegant service. The ambiance is pleasant and it was an indeed rememborable day for us."
"Staying in the Taj Palace gives you 5 star amenities, old world charm, but modern rooms at a fair price. The location in the heart of Colaba and adjacent to the Gaateway of India with the prospect of evening walks along the harbour adds value.The Palace Lounge (free access to residents in the Taj Palace), located just below the Sea Lounge is an added attraction."
"it is one of the best ultraluxurious hotel in the world.words r not enough to describe.i stayed in palace wing and i think its better than new tower wing.wifi speed is ok,restaurant specially masaa craft and sea loungue are best"
"What a wonderful experience.From the moment you arrive you are wrapped in luxury. The hotel is beautiful , my room on the 14th floor had a superb view of India Gate & the sea. The room was spacious , comfortable & spotlessly clean with plenty of wardrobe space.Each morning a newspaper is delivered to the room .& each evening there is a turn down service. The choice of restaurants for breakfast is almost as large as the choice of food being served all of which is well cooked & high quality. The pool area is beautiful well maintained & with friendly staff. The spa offers a range of treatments at reasonable prices. I was in Mumbai to attend a wedding at the Taj Palace & the catering & organisation of the was second to none. A real must is the Heritage Tour of the Hotel each evening"
Nothing to say more Excellent Service & Food keep it up that excellent service Thank you all team members their excellent service they provided in my stay at Taj Mahal Palace hopefully i'll come back with my family
"We total fell in love with this hotel.  The people are amazing, the property is classic yet up to the minute.  The restaurants serve fabulous food. Value for money is extraordinary. We would recommend the Taj Palace to anyone planning a trip to Mumbai."
"Simply if u haven't been here u r missing luxury. . Its not a hotel its not a resort its your palace and you are a king here. And this is all because of staff thier behaviour, attitude ,services contains love Can't write more.... Just come and stay.....uwill know all"
"Beautiful hotel, full of grandeur, always a pleasure to stay. Good choice of food and restaurants, Indian, Middle Eastern, Asian, Chinese, Mexican etc. Centrally located close to the business district for business people, as also close to the shopping areas of the city for tourists. Excellent and Unmatched Hospitality."
"We stayed at the palace side. A beautiful room mixed with old heritage and new technology. The housekeeping is the best I've ever seen, even taking care of wrapping the chargers' cables every day with a strap! The Zodiac Grill is outstanding. Before dinner, we went to have a drink at the Harbour Bar, the oldest in town. Their signature Bombay Blazer not to be missed.   "
Taj Palace was an awesome and great experience in all respects.Every aspect was wonderful.  l would rate as the best 5 star hotel in whole of  Asia.Rooms are well maintained and huge as compared to other hotels and food quality is a delightful experience.
"Whilst I truly love this hotel , the grandeur, the great restaurants and overall facilities, there is a little but missing on service especially when you compare to the Four Seasons, Mumbai which had exceptional service. On balance though if you are going to stay somewhere in Mumbai this is the choice but make sure you book a room in the Palace wing where the rooms are much better "
"It's 4 years since we last visited the old favourite.  I took my wife for a 4 day weekend to celebrate her birthday and we were not disappointed.  This is one of the world's great hotels and where there are plenty that are grander and more luxurious, the Taj Mahal Palace is right up there with the best hotels because of the superb, caring service, the excellent restaurants and that certain something which marks out the really great hotels.  Everything the place does, it does with aplomb, dignity and confidence.  The staff are supremely well trained and perform their duties as if looking after the guest is the only thing they want to do in life.  Sure, there are some (small) shortcomings - some places where upkeep has not yet caught up; light switches which are very confusing to"
"No hotel in any big city in India has ever impressed me enough to write a review about it but this one was something else. From the moment I walked into the Heritage wing of the hotel, even before I had stepped into my room - it seemed different. Besides the meticulously furnished hallways (you cannot call them corridors), the friendliness of the staff is what you notice first. And my two day stay showed that here their first response is to say yes rather than no which is quite typical of most hotels In Mumbai.  The room was one with a view of the Gateway of India and absolutely wonderful. For what it costs, it was entirely worth it. Little touches like rose petals lining the pathway after they cleaned my room, a foot scrub complete with a copper tub to soak my feet in the"
"Since childhood  i have been listening about this place. It was in my busket list that i have to visit this place. When I went to this hotel, it was exactly the same as i had heard about it. Great ambiance, Love the interior of this hotel. Really Marvellous...!!!!"
I've had as always an excellent stay at the Taj Palace. The service food decor and location is fantastic. Their speciality restaurants are exemplary. They even have a Starbucks which is great for me to have my coffee fix. 
"we stayed at  Taj Mahal Palace for weekend with family to celebrate my husband birthday in suit room in palace wing , very good service for in room dinning , excellent hospitality , will remember the day always . suit room great experience . breakfast in sea lounge also very good food variety . taj hotel is really royal ."
Best hotel I have visited till now. The hospitality at TAJ is very different from rest of the 5stars. They care for your stay &.food. I had a very good experience. And would recommend everyone who is looking for this property to stay and feel the difference.
"It was a great pleasure for us to stay in this beautiful and unique hotel with an astonishing service. We first booked a superior room where we checked in at 6 am. There was some construction noise which bothered us a bit, they already had a note in the room apologising for that. However, when we informed the duty manager that this bothered us we were instantly upgraded to another room in the palace itself! It was very beautiful! The breakfast is delicious, the service is beyond amazing and the staff are extremely friendly. I would recomnend for anyone coming to mumbai to stay in this hotel first and foremost!!! Location is perfect too. "
"My husband and i were so delighted after our stay at TAJ MAHAL PALACE.  Yes they make you feel you are in a palace with matchless royalty prevailing everywhere starting from its rooms, its traditional dressed staff , lobby, etc. Swimming pool was exceptionally good and refreshing at pool dining. Breakfast was brilliant. must stay here once to experience the grandeur. and yes morning stroll at GATE WAY OF INDIA is a lifetime experience."
We stayed at the Heritage Wing of the hotel - from check in to check out it was an amazing experience. If you have an option to choose a hotel and your budget permits you must stay at this hotel - preferably the heritage wing!
"i had a lovely experience at taj mahal hotel mumbai excellent hospitality good service and beautiful atmosphere really enjoyed the stay.the poolside is so peacefull and relaxing. the food is good ,room are very comfortable and peaceful all in all excellent experience.  vishnu jalan"
"My wife and I had been wanting to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace for quite a long time. Although the room, service and staff were fantastic, we did face a couple of challenges. Since there were renovations being carried on, we were disturbed by knocking and hammering. When we pointed this out, it stopped temporarily and started again after a while.  On the positive side, the service was fantastic, as is expected from every Taj. When our attendant found out I had a cold, he sent over a glass of warm toddy that was just what the doctor ordered Overall it was a good experience. The pool was fantastic and refreshingly different from the standard 5 ft pools. The food at breakfast also had many European options,  we went gaga over it. But if you have a choice between Taj Mahal Palace"
service was at extraordinary level.. felt really like i was staying in real palace.. rooms were amazingly spacious.. staff makes you feel like u r royalty.. food is just too yummy.. conveniently located..
"Iconic hotel with a rich of history but which has managed to stay relevant, with modern room, top notch amenities and excellent staff. Don't forget to do the free hotel tour at 5pm and to try one of the restaurants!"
"Stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed every minute of my stay: all personnel is very helpful and give you all the feeling that you are really their guest. There are numerous possibilities for food from Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Western, a lovely tea house, nice shops with quality goods. The breakfast is unparalleled, whatever you can imagine is there, very fresh and well prepared and displayed. The service at the reception is very personal: you are taken to the room and all amenities are explained. The housekeeping is great: attentive and answering to all your needs. Check out arranged with 2 hours extra, no problem. The fitness room is very well equipped and the 2 trainers are always available to give you advice. The pool is a beauty, ideal to relax with a drink. The price quality"
"Stayed in the old wing - Club Room with a sea view. The hotel is of the highest standard, every touch from the floral arrangements to the bed linen was perfect. Public spaces and hotel rooms themselves are sumptuous and relaxing at the same time. The Club Lounge was very responsive, the prepared me canapes for my dietary requirements and had what I couldn't eat at the time they delivered to my room. Service such as requests for ironing is close to immediate, there must be several butlers stationed on every floor. All staff are smiling, friendly and welcoming without pretence. There were only a couple of glitches, a breakfast order in the restaurant did not arrive within 20 minutes and I asked for it again but it was not prepared as per my request (which is medical and not simply"
"Having stayed in 5-star hotels all over the world, it is hard to imagine any that matches the Taj for luxury, service and comfort.  The rooms are impeccably clean, the beds, linens and pillows are perfect, and the staff is attentive and friendly without being obtrusive.  To top it off, the pool is a beautiful, serene oasis in the bustling city, and the breakfast buffet is unparalleled.  Overall, an incredible stay.  I was lucky enough to find a ""low season"" reduced rate on Kayak, so it was also an unbelievable value!  Even paying full price, though, the hotel offers an experience commensurate with the cost."
"I had originally booked at the Oberoi but cancelled in view of staying at a heritage hotel and we were not disappointed. The hotel is so charming and beautiful, the service is great and the food is excellent.  Location is also wonderful in Mumbai - don't bother anywhere else this is an experience more than a hotel stay - highly recommended "
"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. We were in Goa - had enough of the hassle we had experienced and decided to up and leave and go to Mumbai. My wife has been wanting to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace so we checked it out on Expedia and whilst it was expensive it was the cheapest room. We had booked a hotel driver due to the time we were there. At the airport we are met by a representative and a driver - pretty awesome. We had emailed them in advance to say we were landing at 815am will probably reach at the hotel at 9am, and wondered if they could let us check into a room to put our valuables away. They emailed saying check in was from 2pm.  To our delight, upon our arrival we were met by a lovely gent and taken to the lounge for our welcome drink. We ended up checking in there - talk"
"Have stayed in some great hotels, not all 5* necessarily but hard too think of anywhere in a City location that matches the Taj. What an experience! We had been booked into the Tower but on arrival rooms for us and the couple travelling with were not ready. They therefore offered us a choice of 2 rooms on separate floors in the Tower or switching us to the Old wing including use of the Executive Club. Once we had seen the old wing it was a no brainer. What a place! The hotel reeks of history and it was amazing looking at the pictures of previous famous guests but that isn;t reason for this rating.  All the staff were wonderful, smiling all the time and nothing was too much trouble for them. Breakfast sitting near the pool was terrific. After dine run the club was also relaxed"
"We checked into an icon. She lived up to our expectations. Full marks on all counts. The hospitality, the food, the service, the bars, the ambiance were all AAA. A truly memorable experience. Highly recommended."
"Its a historic landmark not because of terrorist attacks but because of its magnificent architect building overlooking the Arabian Sea and the Gateway to India. It has extravagant interiors, supremely comfortable rooms and a great range of dining opportunities."
"I really only give a 5 star rating for a hotel if it is exemplary and the Taj gets my vote. The building itself reeks of nostalgia and has been maintained to the finest standards. Rooms are exceptional and the service levels go beyond what is expected. A big thumbs up, it has been a truly memorable stay and I look forward to returning."
"the hotel was fantastic, really nice the staff were extremely helpful, helped us book our cinema tickets and dinner reservations in the city. the sea lounge afternoon tea is a must staying here or not."

Words fail to express the amazing stay I had at the Taj. It has an atmosphere of elegance and ease. The interior is truly beautiful The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is an architectural marvel near Gate way of India and probably one of the most photographed building
Just visited the Taj for a function and I got my 3 months kid along and the function clashed with my child's feeding time. I loved how the travel and business center preppie helped me get a quick room for the time required. Thank you Taj. The best service you can get in a hotel in India
"It's one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed at.   Great rooms, service and food. Specially de buffalo steak.   Greatly located, beautiful view of the ocean, surrounded by culture and places to visit by foot.   What an experience! "
One should definitely visit this hotel. Amazing breakfast..ambience electrifying. . Extra ordinary food.. restaurant mind blowing. .we went there for just a day shopped at palladium mall .rooms are very spacious a bit pricey.. but overall a must visit hotel
"Words fail to express the amazing stay I had at the Taj. It has an atmosphere of elegance and ease. The interior is truly beautiful, and I recommend the tour to learn about the grand history. I took a city tour arranged by the concierge and led by a remarkable woman. The tour offered an insider view of Mumbai that I wouldn't have been brave enough to explore on my own. All of staff members that I encountered were helpful and professional. Every detail is attended to with competency and care. I hope to stay many times in the future!"
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is an architectural marvel near Gate way of India and probably one of the most photographed building in the city. Inside the hotel, beautiful decoration can be seen.The rooms are pleasant The  room service quite good .Persons manning reception are very charming and ever  .smiling.I read somewhere that Taj People don't smile but that is not the case.Ever smiling staff welcomes you every where The breakfast at Shamiyana is quite enjoyable with very co-operative staff there.Ther are number of other facilities as per requirement.In short you feel homely there and stay is quite enjoyable.This is a dream destination for a number of people despite a variety of hotels in the city.Taj is Taj!"
"Heaven for old world charm, this hotel engulfs you in its mesmerizing ambiance. Beauty to the eyes and all other senses, this place boasts of lot of firsts of the country (elevator, bar etc). If you are able to pull yourself out of this spellbinding atmosphere, there are worldly restaurants to bowl you over. Wasabi, Zodiac Grill, Masala Kraft phewwww.... its a long list.  Overall, this is a must do place which will bowl you over again and again.  PS Choose the heritage wing. Even though expensive, there is a charm to it unlike the tower which is like any other hotel."
"Wonderful, what a beautiful hotel,such a great and important history too, rooms very nice, clean, quiet, great views, very pleasant staff, several restaurants and bars, lovely authentic decor, a must do!"
Best service in the world of any hotel I have stayed at and I have stayed from Europe to Beijing. They pay attention to every little detail. Even saw I brought a keyboard and mouse so they brought me a mouse pad. They drew a bath for me just as part of the service. It was truly a very impressive stay.
"Twenty eight years prior to staying at the Palace my husband stood outside by the Gateway of India and looked in awe at the hotel wanting one day to stay there.For our 29th wedding anniversary he decided to fulfill his dream he booked a 3 night stay at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.It was a wonderful surprise for me and one which both of us will treasure for a long time. The ambiance and the history of the palace made it all the more special.We stayed in the Palace wing and were offered butler service. Manoj was excellent, he made our anniversary special with little touches such as a cake, gifts and a photo to remember our special day.The hospitality of the staff is second to none. We were truly made to feel special. The experience has made it difficult for us to stay elsewhere on"
"I generally dodge big hotels as I prefer small personal establishments with a sense of place. As I was traveling with friends, we settled on the Taj due to consensus. As a frequent traveller across Europe, Africa, South America, etc. and one who has had to host clients for business events in luxury places, I am critical of hotels.   Not the Taj. It really does exceed any and all exectations. Amazing thoughtful service that I did not believe really existed any longer. Excellent, delicious food, beautiful environment and facilities. Just everything was grand, classy, without pretention. Total class.   If you can afford it, stay. It's worth it."
"We stayed at the Taj in the beginning of our trip to Mumbai. Having high expectations of this hotel from having stayed at the Taj in Cape Town South Africa I was not disappointed. I have never experienced such excellent hospitality and remarkable attention to detail. From the time we walked In we were treated like royalty. We had a complimentary foot spa upon arrival to ease the transition after a long trip (not requested by the way, simply the hotels welcome). Our bags were lost by the airline and that night the Taj delivered a Destress  Kit to me in the form of silk pjs. Everyday little thoughtful gifts were left for me. There was no request that was not attended. Not only that it was fulfilled beyond expectation. From the concierge to the housekeeping staff there was not"
"i stayed in so many 5 stars equal to this hotel(in price),bt living in the taj mahal palace is really like mile stone.no words to describe their service.excellent rooms with all features.go for palace wing,no idea about tower wing but palace wing is obviously better.THANK U TAJ"
"Right from entering the hotel premises to leaving the hotel, the feeling has been very royal. Worth every penny spend. So many varied restaurants and activities to do within the hotel, that a solo trip never felt lonely. Would love to go back and stay with them again and again."
"The only complaint I have is that I am unable/unable to find anything to complain about. As a frequent traveller across Europe and Asia, I have never come across such helpful staff and services.  It is not just about the excellent  location or the ambience  - it is really about the smiling and helpful services rendered.  Extraordinary experience."
We are a family of 3 with a young daughter and stayed at the Taj Palace for the last 2 nights of our trip through India. What a wonderful place. We stayed in the palace wing - the old bit - and had a fantastic 3 day stay. The pool is full length and deep which my daughter rated highly. Staff were incredibly attentive and our room was both well appointed and spacious - even with 3 of us staying in it. A heritage venue so do take up the offer of a guided tour and brief talk. The food is of a very high standard and the complimentary elements were a delight eg. high tea.
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel was a worthy experience. The ambience is grand and inviting, the staff are friendly and eager to help, except the women in the sarees who seemed rather snooty.  The food was excellent and the service too."
"Visited the Shamiana with friends on 12/8/15 midnight  - 13/8/15 morning around 4-430 am, We were 6 covers. The attitude of staff towards service was really bad and good quality was also not upto the mark. Hospitality word is not being valued. DISAPPOINTED!!!. Not expected at least from this heritage establishment. "
"Still waiting for TAJ feedback mail, haven't received one yet, but I would like to provide feedback which is:  ""Thank you so much TAJ for providing such a wonderful service and offering us such beautiful moments for our kids and us.   We would especially like to thank Mr. Saksham for offering such amazing services and also for remembering our preferences withoiu providing any prior information.   Thank you for making our stay truly memorable.  P.S. Thank you again for upgrading our room from the Tower wing to the Palace wing.""  VIVEK JAIN # 549"
If you are undecided about whether to stay here - I would say just do it. Yes its expensive but the experience is unforgettable. Grand & opulent yet friendly and very guest focussed. We were so fortunate in that we were upgraded to a Palace room and it was quite honestly the most amazing city hotel room i have ever stayed in.  We sat by the pool drinking cocktails all afternoon enjoying the sunshine in such elegant surroundings.  Our only problem was that we only had time for one night there!
"We loved it. Everything. The food, the hospitality, the views. Just extraordinary. It is an extremely special place, and we felt lucky to have been able to visit.   Plus, having stayed at a couple other hotels during our visit made us appreciate the Taj's location even more.   I'd highly recommend it to anyone."
"had been there for an official event and had stayed there for a day, the service was indeed great, the hotel staff had catered to all the needs as and when needed. the event was held in the crystal ballroom. the food was awesome true to its five star mark. the ambiance of the place just gives u a high of working in a luxurious environment and definitely helps you work more efficiently :)"
"We spent a night at the taj for my birthday. There is not much to say: everything is perfect, right at the top of the class. From the room, to the view, to the food, to the service , to the pool...one could not ask for more, and the price of a room certainly shows that! An incredible experience."
"From the moment we arrived we felt we were treated like royalty, and this despite we were very obviously two middle-aged ladies travelling cheaply! Whereas most guests arrive in style we turned up in what was practically a tuk tuk. But this didn't matter, we were greeted with the same pomp and courtesy as everyone else . Nor did the fact that we couldn't get the tipping organised (not sure how much, no change etc). We are neither rich or stylish but we were treated as if we were and this really made the experience for us. The hotel itself is beautiful and suffused with history, and the food is very good particularly the varied and plentiful buffet breakfast. We were ill when we arrived, and for most of the time we were there, so we were eating poorly. The staff did not bat an"
"This stay was an absolute disaster, from the pick-up at the airport to the departure. * Pick-up at the airport - You should tell your drivers to manage expectations of their passengers. When asked how long it would take to reach the hotel, they should overstate and over deliver, not understate the duration of travel and get there one hour after the time that had been indicated as a guidance. I appreciate traffic conditions are highly volatile - clear reason to be conservative  * Room service - As a result of the driver telling me non sense about the time we would reach the hotel, I could not have lunch, as I had planned to, when I got to the hotel. Because of your inefficient service, I spent the entire day, until dinner time, without food in my stomach * Reception - As I was"
"Really enjoyed my stay here in July 2015; staff were extremely welcoming and offered a fantastic upgrade, free of charge, for no discernible reason whatsoever. It was very much appreciated, and has easily persuaded me to book again next time I'm in Mumbai."
"Stayed in the Palace Wing and had the sea facing room which i recommend. the hotel has a nice atmosphere in the lobby and the public areas, and the room was very good in the quality and decoration. service of the housekeeping was excellent and the buffet breakfast was also very good. overall, it is an excellent quality hotel that is located very well for shops in the Colaba area and the nearby restaurants."
"inspite of repeated room service and housekeeping prefrences prior to the stay, this hotel fails to provide with the same. they just want to put it down on paper and not implement it. very poor room services."
I had a marvellous stay.  The friendliness of the staff made the hotel feel like a home away from home.  There is the sense that one is living during the Raj but without the baggage of being a colonial. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
"The only place i Love to stay everytym i go to mumbai. Love the food, rooms , ambienece. It has many restaurants serving amazing food. My fav is Golden Dragon the chinese is ourstanding probably the best in town. Also, Wasabi by Morimoto is authentic Japanese which is again out of the world. Other like Masala craft,  Shamia , Souk etc are also very nice. "
This hotel seriously knows how to pamper and their guest. It was one of the most special experience in terms of service and thoughtfulness we have experienced ever. I travel alot and stay at various brands but every time I stay at the Taj it is alays memorable. Just to experience the service and their fantastic F&B is a must.
"Beautiful and unique hotel full of history and quality. Very pleasant stay. Clean and new rooms, romantic and very kind people are working there. Also wonderful shops inside the hotel. Perfect location, easy to go around by foot as well"
"Excellent Hospitality enjoyed at Mumbai, Taj Mahal Palace Hotel..Helping staff,Cleanliness of Hotel and Room View Was Superb...  Second Good experience with Taj Mumbai.. Must visit to Enjoy the Hospitality of TAJ at this place."
I was there with my partner and friend staying 1 night at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel and my partner and i were upgraded to the Bell Towen suite and other friend was upgraded to the Dolphin suite. We were speechless when the staff showed us our room. It was magical and the service is top notched. We will definitely be back.
"Being as ex member of staff many years ago, it was always my dream to come and stay here , well that dream came true in the form of a birthday gift from my wife. Everything was excellent right from the check in at the lobby to till the time of departure. what was really touching was the trouble the house keeping  dept took to even find a tie similar to the one i used to wear on duty and was presented to me as a take away gift . A Cake was placed in the room and the room was decorated with balloons..... lovely gesture, brought tears to my eyes. this was like a coming home experience which i will always cherish will definitely return."
"The hotel, history, service, location, etc etc is simply world class - we stayed for a week and cannot wait to come back - the swimming pool and spa facilities are superb - if possible book a club room and the extras are really good - high tea, cognac hour etc "
"We were at Taj Mahal Palace, Colaba few days back to celebrate our Anniversary, and were surprised by the Hospitality shown by everyone from reception to valet to doorboy.. Checkin was smooth & Room service was very quick., The Sea View room with Gateway of India a stones throw away was really mesmerising. Truly amazing time.."
The hotel is located right opposite the Gateway of India thereby providing scenic views. The hotel has a plush feeling and overall experience is satisfactory. It is far from airport so you have to budget enough time for transportation.  The restaurants are good and provide ample food options for all categories. Try to get sea view room. 
"Loved the Hospitality by TAJ Employees. Special thanks to Natasha on they way she greeted us.  Excellent Ambience, great food, feels good to see History of India. Taj palace is not just a hotel, it's a historic monument to watch for. Excellent artefact possessed by TAJ."
"If I am going to stay in South Mumbai, or I am accompanied by someone who is visiting Mumbai for the first time, this is where I stay.  Great location and good staff.  The concierge has well thought out lists of places to visit and they can arrange very good tour guides.  The lobby is great. We enjoy walking along the boardwalk. "
"We went first time to Mumbai stayed in Taj,very impressed with service , food cleanly ness ,staff, room, everything just as seen on the T.V.even facilities such as hair,beauty,shopping etc you name it.was bit hesitant when booked because of the rainy season,enjoyed the stay so much didn't feel like going out and can't believe hardly went out.Exilent ............... Exilent planing to have our daughter's wedding in Taj."
One of the worlds wonders I was not disappointed   It is crowded and you need to watch out for those preying on tourists   We had a personal guide which I recommend as you will not see or learn as much without a seasoned guide  It is very crowded and they have 2 lines for tourists and locals.   Also you will need to give up your shoes when walking in the temple and don't worry you do get them back  Definitely a bucket list item 
"I am traveling to mumbai frequently,,  I'll stay on this hotel for every trip,,,  Really u feel the history of this big hotel.   Luxury rooms and so comfortable,  nice staff and helpful.  I reserved Sea Facing room and Really it was really nice experience  Thanks to Taj Mahal Hotel management.   "
"The Taj Mahal Mumbai is a unique experience.  In the heart of what used to be the British quarter, the most challenging aspect of staying at the Taj is returning all of the friendly greetings from the staff.  You really feel like a private guest, not just a client.  The hotel is also located in a great part of the city for restaurants, museums, a trip to Elephant Island, and many other sites.  This is really one not to be passed up for the more modern hotel chains to the north."
"I shouted myself one night to see if all the reviews are accurate. They were, my room was facing the sea with a stand out view of the Gateway to India. Restaurants were great, breakfast was great. The whole stay had a great feeling and ambience about it. The staff were fantastic and extremely helpful. They organised transfers to and from the airport. I got a surprise in the morning as they packed a takeaway breakfast as I left early , I actually snuck in and had breakfast but it was a nice touch. I Left on Saturday and breakfast starts at 07:00, you can get in earlier but expect to see them still setting up the hot food. Definetly worth trying at least once . Trips to Elephanta are right across the road."
"This Hotel in itself is iconic and it offers a very pleasant view of the Gateway of India. If you are able to get a sea view room, it would be best.  We can just gaze the sea and the hustle -bustle around the Gateway of India, through out the day and it also brings a unique experience. The Hotel staff at Taj as usual was great and they went extra mile to understand your request and offer you a great experience."
"An establishment and historic hotel that has to be visited, we stayed at this hotel and the decor is traditional and reminiscent of british empire colony. There are many famous visitors that have stayed at this hotel from heads of state to actors. The rooms are set across two buildings, the new part of the hotel and the old. If you are able to stay in the old part of the hotel this is advised. The security at the hotel is comparable to an airport since the terrorist attack at the hotel which now provides an element of reassurance. We visited during christmas and the hotel was decorated with various items including a large christmas tree. They had a choir every night singing christmas songs. The restaurants at this hotel are very expensive by India standards and are"
"What can we say! From start to finish the hotel made our stay outstanding!!! While you would expect a level of quality, this hotel goes WAY beyond! The attention to detail and service provided is exceptional and far above any other hotel we have ever stayed in! I really can see why this hotel is rated one of the best in the world! "
"Had several truly a magnificent stay experiences at this Iconic hotel! Excellent service - always with a smile, situated in a perfect location, delicious global cuisine backed by world class amenities for business and leisure."
"The location and the grandeur of the place is most notable and it combines very well with the quality of service ,House keeping and Food is outstanding . This is a hotel which every one must plan to stay atleast once in their life time ."
If you want to stay in taj mahal and enjoy a prestigious stay of royals you have to stay at the palace. I recommend it for special occasions as I went their to celebrate my first anniversary. The paths in the palace gives you the experience of living in a palace.  Stayed at the luxury grande king room with a city view. 
"The best hotel with the best service in the world is the Taj palace, mumbai. I enjoyed every single moment, & miss it already. The service was impeccable,  the food was to die for, the room was excellent, the atmosphere was heavenly. truly the best hotel in the world ..."
"I would like to thank the whole staff for making it an excellent stay.The reception staff showed a very welcoming hospitality which made us very happy regarding our tiresome trip. The concierge was also very helpful and up to speed. Whenever we asked for a car to take us around, it only took a few minutes for them to arrange it. Food & Beverages were extremely delicious. Spa was beyond relaxing as well. The location was perfect with many facilities around us, also for a night walk. Im looking forward into coming back to Taj."
Amazing hotel. Greeted by the staff and given garlands and bindi ( red dot on forehead )as we arrived. Checked into the room and it was amazing. The room over looked the sea and India Gate. We only stayed one night but the experience was awesome. Lots of bars and food places near by. Use the high tech gym and after had a dip in the swimming pool. 
"I really liked this hotel but was expecting a traditional indian decor and oppose to traditional english. Airport transfers were not included and food was over-priced. Apart from that, I really enjoyed everything else. We were upgraded to taj club room with was awesome and had a view of the gate of india."
"Had booked a room in the tower and was celebrating an occasion. I was floored when they informed on arrival that I've been upgraded to the Palace.  Fantastic room with luxury in detail (I mean this - every inch of area). I stayed at the Luxury Grand room - with a view to the gateway, and it was amazing.  A complimentary cake in the evening just added to the already lavish stay.  Breakfast - elaborate spread and courteous staff.  An amazing amazing experience to sum it up, with my mind planning a next trip soon."
"Excellent room and very Curtis staff there service is excellent you just feel like home inside ,excellent food and verity,the taj location is very excellent, I think the taj ( gate way of India) is proud of Mumbai,"
"We topped and tailed a week sightseeing in India with stays in this hotel at the start and end of our holiday.   We'd booked in the Tower wing, which whilst not the prettiest of buildings from the outside, was really nice inside. What really impressed me is how welcome we were made to feel, irrespective of whether you were staying at the Tower or the Palace itself. We received a complementary upgrade to a room in the Palace on our second visit, which was a real treat.   Aside from the history and the absolutely stunning hotel, there is a lot to love about this hotel. Every detail is considered and the staff are so friendly and helpful.   The car service that met us at the airport was great. The concierge was brilliant - recommending and booking trips and restaurants for us, and"
"queen elizabeth, john lennon, JFK... Just to name a few of the most distinguished guests of this hotel. The ""old"" , more traditional part of the hotel is simply amazing. The ""Tower"" is nothing to write home about, but still very very good by Mumbay standards. I would recommend the garden restaurant. i loved having my afternoon tea here, and the staff was extremely nice and attentive."
"There was never any debate where I was going to stay for two nights whilst in Mumbai. This hotel lives up to all the expectations and more. The staff can't do enough for you, the hotel is immaculate and the food is excellent. From here you can walk safely to the gateway of India and other magnificent colonial buildings in very close proximity to the hotel. Don't be intimidated by people staring and stopping you, in my experience they are being friendly, avoid giving beggars money and don't venture out after 10pm at night. It is well worthwhile paying the hotel concierge to arrange a 4 hour tour of the city. The drivers are hotel employees and take your welfare very seriously. You get to see all the impressive sights from the relative safety of an air-conditioned hotel car and"
Very nice staff a royal welcome fantastic food amazing pool beautiful location a memorable visit ample choice for food Indian and international grand property and heritage site wonderful experience one of the best in life
"I have traveled to a number of countries and stayed at many very luxurious hotels.  I can say without reservation that the Taj Mahal Palace is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at.     The best and most friendly staff from the front desk to the security guards who wished me a good morning/afternoon each day.  My room was kept in perfect condition, and also had a wonderful view.    I simply can't say enough goods things about my stay."
"This Hotel is one of the best Hotels in Mumbai, having a V good location at GATE WAY OF INDIA, COLABA, Visitors from Foreign countries have a lot to see shop near the Hotel.   The quality of services is V good. Rooms are V spacious and the staff is V courteous, Highly recommend it for all who can afford a 5*"
"Words cannot begin to express how much I love this hotel! The hotel itself is beautiful but what makes this a top notch experience is the staff and hospitality. I've never felt so well taken care of in my life. I loved the welcome flowers and toy rickshaw in my hotel room. The concierge gave excellent recommendations for restaurants and sights in the area to explore so I was able to experience the best of Mumbai. I got really sick in Mumbai and had to be hospitalized. The Taj Mahal took care of everything..driving me to the hospital, booking my hospital room, sending staff to stay with me so I wouldn't be alone and checking in on me often. As a solo female traveler alone in India, I couldn't have asked for more. I am so grateful to all the staff who took care of me when I was"
From the check in to the check out and the transfer to the airport the experience was beyond our expectations. The attention to detail was superb and the level of service was out of this world. The whole experience was one of the highlights of our trip to India.
"The finest and best hotel that India has Really very proud of it. met all our requirements and needs. staff is very well aware of their hotel product knowledge. best food best service well maintained , clean and crisp, so welcoming no words to express. front office services the best,laundry services the best, concierge and travel desk services the best,rooms are fantastic, Butlers are multi talented, no room for complaints at all."
"We typically are Four Seasons  patrons and I've stayed at the one in Mumbai but if one has a chance to stay in one hotel in this bustling city, one should stay at the Taj Mahal Palace -- the original building from what I understand and not the tower and it is magnificent.     We had an Executive suite and it was beautiful with great sea views, and the service...well one feels like an Emperor.  The suite gave us access to the lounge for drinks and snacks and we had a great breakfast at the sea lounge.   Besides the breakfast lunch there or in any of the other restaurants is very good. The club sandwich at the Taj is one of the best I have ever had  Unlike most hotel restaurants, around the world, where we always venture to eat out, we ate more meals than we normally do at the"
"Coming from a country (UAE) where 5 star hotels are everywhere, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel provided us a magical anniversary experience.  Phenomenal staff, outstanding attention to detail and personal attention.  And the ambience and environment is superb."
"Awesome Surroundings , food , drinks & unmatched hospitality even the room ambiance was given its due care & i don't have any further words to add , however due consideration has to be given to budget & only richest or corporate's can afford it."
Dear GM My stay was exceptional and the level of detail in terms of attendtion to service was magnifificent. i stayed there 20 years ago as a child and it was an experience to return.  a few names stand out - Mr Sandeep Jagtao in Concierge who not only was a mindful of knowledge but ensure i was comfortable in all the advice he gave me and never once gave the impression that this was his job instead it felt like we were childhood buddies - SIMPLE AMAZING!  Thank you again for a wondeerful stay and i look forward to returning with my family
"Very Nice Hotel to Visit. From gorgeous open air settings to simple, elegant indoor settings, the Taj creates stunning wedding décor to help give you the perfect Wedding. It never stops feeling like home. Welcome to ‪‎Taj‬, an oasis of ‪luxury residences‬ in the heart of busy ‪#‎Mumbai‬. Enjoy world-class luxury, exemplary service and the best of modern hospitality that will make you feel right at home! ‪"
"the best hotel experience that we have ever had, most attentive and helpful staff in every part of the hotel. Breakfast was amazing, room with a stunning view, I would definitely recommend the hotel to everyone who want to be treated like royalty"
There is little more that I can add to the splendid reviews already posted. Stayed in the old wing and would recommend this to every potential guest as it gives a real feel off the splendour and history of the hotel. The breakfast buffet is the best I've had in India and each of the restaurants that I visited were really good. Pool area is great with lovely staff that are only too delighted to chat and give their insight on Bombay. Really looking forward to my next visit. 
"Perfectly located. The Taj is an architectural masterpiece and inside the majestic atmosphere along with exceptional service that is delivered with a sincere pride makes this accommodation an absolute must. So, do not hesitate. If you want to feel how it might be, and live as it could be, then the Taj is ideal inspiration."
If you would want to experience bygone grandeur and excellent ambiance in a totally  great setting.....do visit! Hospitality is par excellence. The location is non-nonpareil. Make sure you don't miss the Tour conducted every day at pm.  It reveals the Hotels great history.
"My first visit to the hotel after the terrorist attack of 2008. Brilliant reconstruction and no traces left if the gory events almost 7 years ago. The memory wall with names of those killed salutes the brave. The royal setting is still intact, outside as well as inside in some areas."
"For people who want to a amalgamation of both vintage decor and world class service in one hotel then this is the place you want to be at.Even though you don't get the sea view room trust me the pool side view rooms are unparallel.The breakfast buffet has a huge range of food so make sure you do not binge on one dish,The highlight for me were pan cakes and cheese omlette along with bacon to die for.I am not into vintage stuff so that;s why I was dissapointed in the begining but the rooms made up for it.Location is in Colaba so you can go to nice pubs or restaurants nearby if you are not willing to spend a fortune at the hotel bar."
"A truely historical place.  Stayed in the historic wing, and felt I was staying in a Museum.  The service is amazing, starting at the airport where the hotel has a team there to greet you.   Tried several outlets, all outstanding.  Our room came with butler service.  Very helpful since we landed at midnight.  The one take away is the true sense of hospitality you get when staying at The Taj Mahal.  The warmest welcome you will get anywhere."
My first experience to stay in one of the best hotel of India. It was a memorable experience till the time i arrived and i left the hotel i was getting of felling of royal.  The hotel has some superb boutiques offering bespoke tailoring. Rooms offer lovely views of the Gateway. Great location in the Old town (Colaba) that has a lot of history. If i rate on the basis of my experience  Amenities :5/5 Hotel staff: 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Comfort: 5/5 Location:5/5 Value: 5/5 I can say that my  unforgettable experience. Everyone must stay for a night or day there and you will get to know and what it is.
"Wonderful experience thanks to outstanding team members such as the knowledgeable concierge team, or the lovley guest relations team with in-room check-in when I arrived late at night.  Lots of attention to small details which are highly appreciated, such as when making up the room: e.g. putting a bookmark into my book, or tidying up the ear phones with a velcro fastener - very impressive! I can highly recommend this hotel."
"Had gone with my wife and 2 kids for a 2 night stay and had a wonderful experience. The staff was very helpful and always ready to help, amenities were excellent, the rooms were spik and span and so was the hotel, food was excellent and to top it all up, we had booked for the new building but were upgraded to the Palace rooms without any additional charges. Overall it was a stay worth to the fullest."
The hotel is full of history and luxury.  I have stayed several weekends over the past year and have never had a bad experience.  The service is fantastic from the moment you check in.  The rooms are very comfortable and the atmosphere is excellent.
"As I have lived for a couple of years in Bombay, returning back to the City is a bit of home-coming. And despite all jokes about India and that it never changes: this city changed a lot. You have the Worli bypass now, many high-rise building along Peddar Road, the traffic is worse than ever - yet the Taj has not changed, not even after the dark moments a few years back. First order of the day: stay in the OLD WING. Separate check-in, Black-on-white marbled floors, cast-iron handrails, wooden stairwells, larger rooms than in Tower, larger bathrooms too.  Then it´s about personal taste: book the old wing to the front with a view to the Gateway of India (beautiful at dawn, other than that a bit noisy) or a sidewing with a view on the pool. Both have their advantages. But spend the"
"Taj the name suggests everything right....  The BEST experience that one can ever have here....  It was my wife's 30th birthday and I wanted to make it very very special for her....  So I booked a room at Taj and informed them the occasion....  We were so happy to see all surprises, gifts, cake, etc. arranged by the hotel, and going out of their way, making it so very special for her !!!!  If its your birthday or your special someone's birthday you've gotta come here....  The food, ambience, service, experience, everything is royal and deserves a twenty on ten !!!!  This is heaven in Mumbai!!!"
I was always thinking to stay here..... dream come true..  Heritage building... very nice. I have booked for tower wing but they have upgraded to heritage building....   Breakfast was very nice. friendly staff at restaurant. Excellent hotel...
"1. Food- Restaurants in the hotel are phenomenal! Try their pav bhaji. The interior seating for the restaurant was classy, but the outdoor seating was a tropical, poolside experience. It felt like an oasis inside a palace!  2. The service is unmatched. We were supplied with a driver who knew the city inside and out. He took on a the most fascinating tours of bazaars and chowpattys. Security is a high value in this hotel- you are checked extensively by guards upon entering, but they are so polite and charming, I didn't mind at all. All of the staff were amazing!  3. The location of this palace is on southern tip of Mumbai's coast. You step out of the hotel and can see the Gateway of India. You're only a few meters away form the shore!"
Everything about this hotel gives you a sense of history. a lot of photographs spread over 100 years are displayed. extremely nice hotel at great location with wonderful and hospitable staff. the heritage wing rooms are big and nicely done. Do not take rooms in the back of heritage room since construction on tower is going on and is not a great view. The breakfast are of heritage wing is excellent with fabulous view. Food is awesome in the hotel in any of the restaurants. you are always felt welcome in this hotel. swimming pool is lovely. This hotel stands for everything with JRD TATA stood for. A lovely experience every time you go.
"We stayed at this hotel for the last few nights of our Indian and Nepal holiday. It was everything you could hope for with wonderful views from the bedroom, fabulous bathroom and good storage for clothes. The little extra enhanced our enjoyment i.e. flower garland and a go-away gift, which I won't tell you about otherwise it wouldn't be a surprise! The check out process was a new things to me where a gentleman came to your room -, having checked if it was convenient and he brought with him the bill for the stay. We paid him and he came back with the receipt. The restaurant and breakfast was wonderful, and the little other events such as drinks in the bar - happy hour, buy one get one free were welcome. You could ask for any drink and it was made especially for you...I asked for"
"My husband and I went to Mumbai specifically to stay in this hotel. Everything about it was incredible. The food, service, rooms etc. make sure to take the hotel guided tour as it was very interesting. The facilities were amazing as well. We used the pool and gym facilities daily and were very pleased with them. "
Quite an history connected to this beautiful building. I really like the service provided by the staff. they made my stay amazing. I love Taj group for their amazing hospitality and the Palace lounge was a huge bonus.
"Time off to relax you will not go wrong these people can not do enough for you, really enjoyed our stay here will be back very soon rooms are very clean and tidy and have tea making facility, staff are always available for your every need and as the program on the television says what ever you want they will do there best to sort it out for you. All food tastes are catered for so you will not run out of dishs weather it be cod and chips or a curry."
"Words cannot describe the experience of staying in this hotel. I have travelled over 107 countries in the last 6 years and have stayed at many hotels. Taj Mahal Palace Hotel Mumbai is by far the top hotel in service, comfort and style of any hotel I have ever stayed in. Congratulations to all the team at Taj Mahal Palace Hotel Mumbai for a job well done. I highly recommend this hotel and I believe they rate 7 Stars on a 5 Star scale and a 12 on a 10 point hotel service scale."
"We stayed here for two nights and had a wonderful time. We felt comfortable from the second we entered the building.Excellent Hotel with impeccable service. hey are not too big, not too fancy.From arrival where you are taken straight to your room and check-in completed"
"I stayed for two nights at the Heritage Wing of the Taj in a Club room overlooking the sea and Gateway of India. Right from check-in onwards you know it's going to be a special stay where everything you want you'll have and nothing will be too much. The heritage wing is the only wing to stay in. It's the old wing but has been renovated with all the latest gadgetry and equipment. This property is their showcase property and it definitely lives us to it. Well appointed rooms, comfortable beds, great butler service. And then there are the little things that only Taj does.... First evening they leave copper vessels with salts and rose petals to wash and relax ones feet in... As we are walking to the car on our way back to the airport, literally we are stepping in and the hostess"
"This huge hotel with good restaurants, shops, full facilities, is much more than a place of accommodation. It exudes charm of an era long gone, early 1900s.  I find that both the hotel lobby staff, as well as the elder gentlemen serving in the restaurants are very friendly, approachable, and if, I may add, thoughtful with service-at-heart attitudes. I would recommend having breakfast at the Sea Lounge, by the window, having the early sun rays lighting up your breakfast!"
"Its not only the satisfaction but the wonderful memories you take back with you that make staying at the Taj more pleasant than any other Hotel. I have stayed in various hotels in various countries but we were in Mumbai to celebrate my wife's birthday and I am glad we did that, The entire staff went out of their way to make her feel special. Even my son loved it. You have made us your loyal customers now."
"We stayed here for two nights and had a wonderful time. We felt comfortable from the second we entered the building.Excellent Hotel with impeccable service. hey are not too big, not too fancy.From arrival where you are taken straight to your room and check-in completed"
"on all fronts it is super excellent, particularly eagerness of each and every staff to make your stay comfortable and memorable is just out of the world. i have just been to UK SCOTLAND and IRELAND TOUR of 15 days, i feel they don't even know the meaning of hospitality and customer service they should send their staff to realise that india and particularly to Taj hotels to realise that we really believe in ATITHI DEVO BHAV, visitor is god for us and we treat hin like one."
We stayed here for two nights and had a wonderful time. We felt confortable from the second we entered the building. The Taj Mahal was the best hotel I ever stayed. Super friendly stuff. I must visit when in Mumbai!
"First of all, the rooms don't really compare to other five star modern hotel rooms. They are not too big, not too fancy and some of the furnitures are more than a century old. But that's not why you stay at the Taj. You stay because it is one of the greatest hotels in the world and the most iconic hotel in India. You stay because the Taj has hosted everyone from Queen Elizabeth II, last Shah of Iran, to Clinton and Obama.  The legend goes that when a very wealthy Indian gentleman was denied entry to the then-best hotel in colonial Bombay for being Indian, he decided he would build the greatest hotel the world had seen. Today, it very much retains the same character that it did a century ago. It may look grand outside, but the hotel grounds are quite understated. The service is"
"Excellent Hotel with impeccable service. From arrival where you are taken straight to your room and check-in completed there, to the butler service where you receive a cup of tea / coffee with your wake up call, to the restaurants, then a very streamlined check-out process. The ultimate experience you could expect from a hotel of this calibre."
"Heaven on earth.  Breakfast, service, rooms, pool, SPA, the hotel itself - everything is just fantastic.  Even the products that you find in the bathroom at top quality and make your hair and skin silky and fragrant.  This stay was an experience of a lifetime.  Highly recommended!"
"The decor is so plush as if made for royalty. But I only went there for afternoon tea, and it did not disappoint. With a pianist in the corner, and indian delights presented in alternative ways, it was just surprise after delicious surprise! Very very good value for money too and with it being directly opposite to the Gateway of India you'd be a fool not to come here at the same time."
"Location, location, location, nice property to stay and relax after a busy day schedule. Easy access to all major attractions, reflects Mumbai history,  facing Gateway of India, overlooking the  Arabian Sea."
"A stay at the Taj Mumbai was always going to be pleasurable experience but you have to see to believe and more so ...feel it. Right from the moment you step into the hotel courtyard to the time that you check out, the Taj is an unforgettable experience.Everything in the hotel from the service, to the rooms, to the restaurants, pool and everything worth mention is exceptionally and faultlessly superb. I have to confess I was slightly awed by the Taj's standards before I walked in but the staff is superbly courteous and never ever condescending, and they go not only the extra mile but all the way to make you feel comfortable and welcome. The rooms are beyond compare  and everything is just right..! All your needs within reason are catered to.  The food is great - the breakfast was"
Great place to be :-) The variaty of restaurants is great. The swimming pool and the service around is excellent. I did especially enjoy staying in the old wing and having breakfast in the sea lounge :-)
"Loved the Palace section of the hotel. Absolutely wonderful. Great room and service. Beautiful pool, perfect and outstanding concierge services (Dinesh Singh and Glen Menezes). Yummy and super varied breakfast. Great tour advice. The most wonderful Guest Relation Executive ever: Zeena D'souza. Just too lovely."
We had an amazing time at this hotel and being so close to the Gateway to India. Local restaurants were fabulous and hotel staff was amazing from beginning to end. The arrival ceremonies were also quite special.
"Had a great four days here. My wife and I came to Mumbai for a city break and decided to stay at this iconic hotel. The service was impeccable. Don't miss the afternoon tea at the Sea Lounge. And if you're into celebrity spotting, the hotel's lobby is the place. Rooms are spacious. We got upgraded to a suite. If you can splurge a bit, this is it!"
"Absolutely incredible architecture and décor.  This is truly a palacial experience.  Large rooms with fine furniture and spacious bathrooms.  Great pool area.  Our rates included a buffet breakfast which was fantastic.  Staff service was exceptional, especially our floor butler (3rd floor) and his team who ensured that my wife, who had torn the ligaments in her ankle, was pampered like a goddess.  For evening drinks and dinner we found ourselves eating out mostly as we prefer a relaxed atmosphere without all the formalities, but for anyone wanting to feel like king and queen the Taj was the place to be.  Unfortunately the views were not great and you only had to take one step out of the hotel to find yourself amidst the chaos and filth of Mumbai."
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for one night on July 2, 2015 for business.  It was my first stay at this storied hotel. You're immediately taken back in time and into a quiet oasis in the midst of bustling Mumbai.  There's no escaping the traffic of Mumbai streets to get to the hotel.  It is in South Mumbai, where more expensive real estate abounds.  Due to the regrettable (terrorist) attack on the hotel a few years back -- there's no avoiding that bit of unfortunate history -- security on arrival is strict but handled in a proper and respectful manner.  The door man has a big smile in his traditional garb to welcome you while your bags are inspected.  You are met by a greeter at the door, your name is kindly requested and then you are asked to take a seat in the"
i understand taj initiative for me as gold epicure plus membership is wonderful. even staying in mumbai walkeshwar i never thought to stay at taj palace mumbai. after staying i will renew everyyear and give gift to my near and dear ones. pl be in touch and send me taj activities.
I was there on my 21 wedding anniversary the hotel staff arranged for the special occasion and we both were left with out words for the arrangements  we thank you all from the bottom of our heart  the room we had occupied the sea facing with the view of India Gate on our left and the sea in front was just superb.
"We arrived in  the morning after taking the afternoon flight the day before from Manchester. We were given an early check-in. Other reviewers have told of the superb welcome the hotel gives all its guests, and we received the same. In our room we opened the doors onto the balcony and looked out onto The Gateway to India and the sea.This was the most amazing start to our holiday. I spent the next couple of hours in the pool. This is an incredible oasis of calm and relaxation. The spa staff provided me with a robe and footwear to go to the pool a few steps away. I was then followed by a young man who provided me with a poolside lounger with an umbrella, towels and chilled water. The pool is a good size with sparkling water at the correct temperature. I enjoyed it so much that my"
"From being escorted to my room by the check-in manager to having my bags carried to my taxi upon check-out, service at the Taj Mahal Palace was considerate, cheerful, and helpful. Service in the Zodiac Grill was as impeccable as the food -- a rack of lamb entreé -- was perfectly prepared. My room was large and well-appointed. A table and chairs in an alcove overlooking the Gateway  India was among the niceties. The bathroom -- with full tub and shower -- was well equipped with toiletries and was as large as some hotel rooms I've occupied in Europe. Public areas, notably the hallways, are nearly of museum quality. (The original building, the Palace, was invaded by Muslim terrorists from Pakistan in 2008. they set fire to the structure and killed 31 guests, mostly Indians."
"A great hotel in a superb location. Has a lot of history and it is worth trying out the different culinary delights on offer, although pricey.  The pool was closed when I visited, which was a pity as I did not know that at the time of booking.  Also check your bills when exiting as I found a few errors on mine.  However, all in all this is a truly fabulous hotel."
"Right place to station your foreign clients and keep client meetings .... Good ambience , friendly staff and awesome location where all of Mumbai's landmarks like gateway,  Victoria fountain,  Stock exchange and lovely sea view adds to your delight "
"We happened to be at The Taj Mahal in June for a night and those two days were like a dream. The hospitality was impeccable, if you want the best this is where you come as it is Taj is renowned for their welcoming service so you could imagine this is the Taj Mahal their pillar. Every staff will have a minimum experience of 15 years plus and they know what they are doing, nothing, nothing is taken for granted by them and they look after you like their life depended on it. This stay will go into our memories forever especially my five year old son.  I have been to a number of hotels all over but nothing matches the personal touch from the Taj. We were in the heritage wing and were provided a tour of the wing down memory lanes. I just hope everyone has a chance to experience this"
Staying in any Taj Hotel always an experience of its kind .The grooming the Hotel staffs are excellent . Wish the entire country could learn from you on the customer centric attitude . People at every level is your best asset . One can not expect the Home feeling when one  stay out at any Hotel . But Taj team always prooves them wrong by their attitude and passion .
One of the best hotels in Mumbai. Its known for its interiors. Its a palace from outer and within. Best hotel to dine in and stay at. The Grande suitres are very well known and give you a 'maharaja' feeling
"This review has been long pending unfortunately. I stayed at the iconic Taj Palace Hotel for 1 night on 15th August 2014. The one night at The Taj was a splurge treat for myself. Knowing the iconic status of the hotel and been regaled with stories about its history through my father as well as of the excellent stay he had during his visit there several decades ago, I must say that this was one stay which I was thoroughly looking forward to right from the point of having decided to head to Mumbai.  My overall experience at the hotel was unfortunately bitter-sweet. The pros first. The location - absolutely without a doubt an icon of the city, such a superb location looking out over The Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea. In the commercial capital, it really cannot get better"
"If its service with luxury you are looking for, I doubt you could find anything better. The hospitality is impeccable starting from the reception right up to sending you off. It was a mind numbing experience and we were just going on and on about it. I have been to bigger and expensive hotels but nothing can beat Taj in hospitality and when it’s the Taj Mahal there are no words. You find happiness in how well they look after you, into the small things which just leave you astounded, like placing glasses in the chiller when they know you have bottle of wine to drink, spa slippers ready for the night, the way they are told to interact with children as adults. It in our memories for life! This was on my bucket list to stay at the Taj Mahal and have a drink in the first licence bar"
Front desk staff is long on the LIP and short on the SERVICE.... too much 'yes sir' - 'yes maam'; '' i am sorry for the inconvenience caused' but not much on follow up with the service.... Well trained but not so good attitude towards the guest.... seems like the staff is used to too many one time tourist guests...
"The Taj Mahal Palace is the best place to stay in Mumbai, in our opinion. The staff are friendly and the service throughout the hotel is good. We were very disappointed that the pool was closed without being notified. We were given a room with a view as compensation but no discount, which was a little disappointing. The breakfast is lovely. The gym is very good and well equipped. Our rooms were cleaned twice a day and service in the rooms was very good. DO NOT GET YOUR LAUNDRY DONE HERE. We put in about 10/15 items to be cleaned (small items - socks, t-shirts) and the bill came to £50! It was £1.50 per sock! This is extortionate in my opinion and I was very disappointed with the bill. The manager agreed to 50% discount off the laundry bill on departure. I would stay here again"
"Taj Mahal is a Palace for all.  Best service and well informed, polite, spectacular staff members from the lobby, restaurants, pool area, gym, driver to the cleaners. Thanks for a wonderful lifetime experience."
"My review is of the Heritage wing in this legendary hotel. This has been the best stay I have had so far. I stayed there for a night to celebrate my parent's anniversary. The service was excellent right from the check-in time. We got a pleasant surprise to know that we were upgraded to the Pandit Ravi Shankar suite; and what better way to experience the legendary Taj service! This is a three level suite decked up in marble, paying homage to the world renown  Sitar artist. The facilities and amenities in the suite were top class, the view of the Gateway from all the windows were mesmerizing, the private butler was extremely courteous and made us feel very comfortable. Hours can be spent exploring the alleys of this wing because it is like a museum with artifacts and paintings"
My stay of 10 days in this beautiful hotel was as pleasant as it could be. The staff is excellent and each and everyone go out of their way to make you feel at home and ensure your comfort! The restaurants in the hotel are worth a visit!
"We were at the Taj Mahal in Agra, India in February and although there were hundreds of other tourists there, it was a special experience. It is So beautiful and the story that goes with it is also special. Highly recommend it! The first glimpse of the Taj through the arch of the South Gate is unforgettable."
One of the landmark close to another landmark of Mumbai.Been here couple of times. Its really nice and beautiful from outside as it is from outside.I was here for a fashion show.Though never stayed here ...but got a complimentary room as we had our show here.The room was pretty beautiful and nice. The restaurant serves amazing Indian food.
"Taj is one of the most famous and historical landmark of Mumbai and equally known for its hospitality as well. And years after years, its providing the best of the hospitality to its guests and always have surpassed in every aspect. The personalization of the services is hallmark of TAJ and one must experience it."
"During a land tour from our cruise, we lunched at this hotel. The buffet was incredible and delicious. The staff were very attentive and efficient. The lobby was very elegantly decorated. High security measures have the guests enter thru metal detectors and all vehicles are inspected before entering but this does not deter from the elegance and luxury of this hotel."
"Very royal experience,  ankita was really good and handled us well.  the food quality is exceptional, location is very good. i would recommend to have this experience , its a nice feel. when we visited the swimming pool was in maintenance so we couldn't experience it."
"Taj Mahal Palace, A must visit place. excellent location, excellent food. amazing service.  Historic interiors with a very warm and friendly staff, who is at your service 24*7 with smile.  A great experience."
Stopped in for lunch while touring the city. Amazing food! Incredible service. Chef coming out to check on us was a spectacular touch. Would highly recommend when touring in the heat. Had pictures of Obama and Oprah as you came in which we got a laugh about.
"A wonderful place to have tea or lunch and rest from the trying heat, noise and pollution of outdoor Bombay.   A very peaceful experience in every sense.  Excellent service and utterly professional staff, very attentive to detail and customer needs whilst not intrusive.  The tea room overlooks the Gateway of India and Arabian sea.  A wonderful buffet-lunch is available in the afternoon with sweet and savoury local delights.  The hotel is definitely worth a walk around and does indeed look / feels like a palace.  It has a gallery of luxury shops (mainly western haute couture, jewellery, leatherwear...) which felt like one step too far when you know that just outside the doors is a world of some of the most destitute people in the world.  Of course this can be said about the hotel"
"Lets start with the staff.  This extraordinary hotel is without doubt one of the grand hotels of the world, the furnishings are beautiful, its located in such a premium location in Collaba, Mumbai - and yet it is the staff who make a visit to the Taj something I never easily forget.  I have been visiting this hotel on and off for some six years - as mentioned two years between trips this time - and eyt when I walked into the the Sea Lounge, the dedicated breakfast rooms allocated those staying in the Palace Wing of the hotel, it was as if I had only been there last week.  I sincerely hope the management of the Taj don't mind that I was able to convince this extraordinary team of professional staff to allow me the honour of taking their picture during a quiet moment early one"
"Had a short 1 night stay in the palace wing of the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai and it was truly a wonderful experience for us. The palace wing gives you a beautiful Victorian stay feel when you walk past the corridors and the grand staircase. The suite rooms were excellent and expansive. On the dining front Taj Mahal definitely offers a lot of variety as well as some of the best restaurants within the Taj group. Checks all the boxes for me - location, rooms, food !!"
"From the moment we arrive to the moment we left, everything was perfect. Swimming in the pool and eating in the residents only area around the pool was particularly special. The breakfast were divine. You had to force yourself to stop eating. The room was spacious and the bed luxurious. Can't recommend s stay highly enough. It worth a visit to Mumbai just to stay here."
"This hotel is the best hotel in the world.  The staff is first-class: attentive, kind, discreet, and professional.  The rooms are amazing: luxurious and well-maintained. The location is superb.  And the food is incredible.   Note: I needed to be in a meeting around 3 AM and they have a great business facility.  They have private rooms in which you can use plus they will make you a cup of tea."
"The taj in Mumbai never disappoints. From the moment one steps into the foyer till the time one exits it, the entire experience is very pleasant, very personalised and polite to the extreme. The restaurants in the hotel rank amongst the best in the country and the view of the gateway of India from the rooms reminds one of the hotel's iconic status."
"Me and my family stayed here for one day and found the hotel architecturally beautiful with Excellent location facing the Arabian sea and Gateway of India, very cooperative and care taking staff! If not stayed in The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel your visit to Mumbai is incomplete!"
"I and my family stayed for the first time in Taj Mahal Palace, Aplollo Bunder, Mumbai. What an experience it was. The  small size of the rooms are very well forgotton in lieu of the outstandinf service by one and all. The food is excellent, so are the ambience. The Hotel tour at 5 PM is very informative and a unique experience. I suggest every Indian should stay at least once here."
"The Taj in Mumbai has to be one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Incredible service and little touches that made us feel so welcome plus the location is just amazing.  What's in the area Leopolds cafe is just on the main street close to the hotel the main street is alive at night with lots of shops and street stalls selling jewellery, clothes, bags. Loved it and it's open till late.  Olympia Coffee House is a must. The food is amazing and the place is clean. I am incredibly particular about hygiene and this place was good.  If you are a little more adventurous try a kebab from where the locals eat -  Bademiya. the kebabs are pretty good. I preferred the chicken  one. It's just behind the Taj.  Delhi Darbar is another restaurant on the main street which is pretty good.  For"
"This really is the Taj of all Taj hotels! My husband and I are regular Taj clients, but have never had the opportunity to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai. We usually stay at Taj Landsend which is gorgeous.  However after staying here, this is the place we will return to every time we come to Mumbai. It is so grand! And the corridors full of pictures are beautiful. The service is amazing. Nothing is too much for them.   Usually I struggle to sleep during the first night of my stay at any hotel, but I slept so well in their ever so cosy bed!  The senior staff and waiters all use their heads and common sense when it comes to customer service and this makes the hotel stand out against others.  Would def recommend."
Best place for relax any enjoy in within high class people. The food is even very specialize with best service and you can even enjoy to see complete sea and gateway of India which is heritage place and very one like to visit and see.
"I have done lot of events in this property and was always satisfied with services offered and would recommend this hotel to all, Also when it come to choice of location this hotel is located in heart of city"
"Its an amazing property let you immersed in Royalty at the best place in Mumbai. As you enter the main building, the architecture gives you a feeling of living in a palace, especially the the staircase and dome. Loved the palace and location."
"We checked in for one night, and we really enjoyed our stay, pool was lovely and great wifi.  Recommend this for all.  The hospitality was so nice and we all have had so much fun.  Lovely staff.  Hope to come again some day!  "
"We, me and my brother, booked for one night stay on 23rd June,2015 in the Tower Block and while checking in, we changed our mind and requested a room in the Palace Block. While the front office was locating a room for us, they took us to the Palace Lounge and provided us some nice coffee!   We were given a room, almost at the corner of 4th floor, which had a direct view of the Gateway of India! Viewing Gateway of India on a typical Mumbai rainy day in the evening was the perfect setting for a great stay at this hotel! The room was well equipped and we had couple of drinks at the bar which was not crowded, being a rainy, Tuesday evening. We ordered veg briyani which I wont rate as the best! I had tasted better briyani in other hotels!   Breakfast was provided at the Sea Lounge"
"I stayed here with my wife for a week in March 2015. We had a Grand Luxury Suite (in the Palace Wing) and Balcony overlooking Gateway to India - inclusive Butler. Our next week's stay is in August 2015 and we literally can't wait.  My review will not be verbose - it does not need to be. It will be two words:  ""PERFECTION PERSONIFIED""  Any hotel in the World can build lavish structures,  buy expensive furnishings and decorations but you can't go out and buy staff that care as they do here. Each individual member of staff concentrates and cares so much about his or her unique role in the hotel that the sum of these adds up to much more than the whole. And that is what you receive at this hotel - in abundance ! Yes - you can feel this mystical quality as you spend time in the hotel"
"Our room was on the 19th floor overlooking the water and the Gateway to India.  Room was generously sized, comfortable furnishings and bed, clean spacious bathroom, and included a balcony. Service, especially by Sandeep and Ajit, was exceptional."
Im taj epicure  member  n had visited  taj on 16 may. Warm hospitality  n superb   service  is trademark  of taj n it  lived upto expectations.wil definitely go again.superb food n super view of the gateway  made it a memorable  stay. 
"Great service . The food was great, the location can't be faulted and the Hotel itself is beautiful! highly recommend it! Wonderful Exp. during our stay. The room was newly upgraded and was comfortable,"
"The best hotel in mumbai, World class restaurants. Golden dragon-chinese, Wasabi-Japanese, Zodiac grill-French, Shamiana-coffee shop, Masala kraft-indian food. The best rooms and their biggest asset is their staff."
"I have no words to describe my stay at this beautiful heritage property!  We stayed here for our marriage night and it was a different experience !    Super , Excellent and out of world experience   The service , warmth , hospitality , the club lounge butler service assistance .   Super !!!!!   You really rock Taj Palace ! You are the Best !   Best, Thank you Harsh Parekh"
"I stayed at Old Taj building Executive Suite, and the experience was one of the best memorable.  It was a very special moment for my Family.  Thanks you all the Taj staffs for making my day.  Best Regards Srijit"
It is a vintage hotel so if you are looking for contemporary don't stay here. Staff is awesome and pampers you alot but the rooms are old but clean. We had several issues on the stay but all were resolved upon request.
Went to Seelounge in the Taj Mahal Palace for high tea. Wonderful experience as I sat at the window overlooking the Gateway to India. #travellifeisajourney and this was an amazing memory...make sure to integrate this on your itinerary.
"was there for a conference.  Was allotted a room on 5 th floor and was wonderful. During the entire conference, the service was excellent to the ""T"".   The room was newly upgraded and was comfortable, if somewhat small.  The Buffett breakfast had average choice, but the view from the place was simply awesome...   Walking through the corridors, with the history and pictures you also feel like royalty.  Will definitely stay there next time I am in Mumbai"
"Wonderful Exp. during our stay for our 10""th anniversary. Great staff, they take care of each and every small details. My kid enjoyed their hospitality.  and we were overwhelmed by their surprise cake / flowers at 12 Night."
"Great service (although it can be overkill, if you are a person who likes to be left alone and like your privacy with no interruptions). The food was great, the location can't be faulted and the Hotel itself is beautiful! highly recommend it!"
"Wonderful service, great staff, very attentive, wonderful hotel, great location. Staff was very attentive and caring. They took care of my kids stay by arranging drawing books and colors for him, dance class in the evening. They ensure that our marriage anniversary be the memorable one, they sent cake, champagne , flowers and decorated room-- All complimentary. So it was gr8 wow. Staff was attentive , caring, joyful and happy. Hotel is wonderful with attached history to it. Overall superb experience my family and i had."
"Recently got a chance to visit Mumbai and i am really happy that i chose The Taj Mahal Palace & towers to stay.   Words are not enough to describe this marvelous piece of more than 100 years old history. The hotel is divided into 2 wings the Old one - Palace wing and the new one Tower wing. I would surely recommend to stay at the palace wing as the rooms looked more spacious and you really feel like you are staying in a palace. Also the gym & pool are in the palace wing and one would really not want to walk that much to get to the gym / pool. Both the wings are connected with some world class restaurants in between.  The hotel staff is excellent , service standards are really high. They really make you feel special staying at this hotel. Right from the time you check-in to"
"The Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai is not just opposite the Gateway of India, it is also the most pleasant gateway to one of India and Asia's best cities. Outstanding hospitality, excellent amenities and an amazing choice of food leisure and business options make this one of the best hotels in the Taj Group and certainly superior to competition."
"Food is good. Friendly people and nice room. The hotel itself is a beautiful architecture. Easy to get a cab with air condition. The hotel is close to Gateway of India, one of the great buildings there. If you would like to walk around for 20 minutes, you will see a lot of magnificent and nice buildings around the region."
"Visited the Taj Mahal palace on June 20, 2015 with my wife and son.  The staff was kind to upgrade us to the palace wing. The hotel had alot of surprises in store for our 4yrs old son. They gave him a welcome kit ,with his own room keys a puzzle, a teddy , puzzle. In the evening they had arranged for flower arrangements classes. In the evening the sent a pastry for him. They also gave us a family photograph. Overall one of the best Hotel's I have ever stayed. "
Stayed in this hotel as part of Jules Verne tour.  Luxurious hotel with great service and food.    The rooms are spacious and very comfortable with amazing bathrooms.  We had a view of The Gateway to India. Fascinating just to stand and watch the goings on and listen to the sounds of the hustle and bustle long into the evenings.   Mumbai is a great city and would love to return again one day.
We had most exceptional stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel Mumbai for 21st/24th June 2015 during our recent holidays in Mumbai. Hotel staff did all possible to make our stay memorable & offered assistance at every step during our stay in Taj Mumbai.
Ultimate staying experience. You really get value of money you spent. One small Heritage walk explains rg Taj Palace & its history. You really become proud after listening it. Raja & Maharajs has stayed in this hotel & now you. Welcome & other hospitality is w/o compramise
It was my wish atleast one day I should stay in this hotel...wish has happend recently....nice experience ... Hope I visit again...very pleasant atmosphere... very cooperative staff and service is very good...friendlyness over all very good experience ...great...
"Stayed at The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai for a business trip in June 2015 and wasn't disappointed.  The rooms are large and spacious and the hotel is immaculately clean. The hotel staff are extremelly helpful and their client service is first class!!!"
"It is a MUST  When visiting Mumbai you have to saty at least one night at the Taj. The exquisitness, the glamour and the sights make it an unforgettable experience. It is close to every site of interest. Take the ferry and sail to the opposite side of the bay. Visit the old Portuguese fortress at Chaul. It is unique !"
"This was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The service was beyond compare, the staff really outdid themselves everytime. What really impressed me was that every night after I arrived I would find a foot spa. I was a kind gesture since I would come back to the hotel soaked from head to toe.   The breakfast was immense, the choice was bountiful and delicious, with delicacies from China, Vietnam, India and so forth. The staff, once again, went out of their way and despite all they had to offer, they taylored it to my taste offering me even more choice.   On that note, I have tried two of the restaurants, The Souk and Masala Kraft. I really loved The Souk. The view was fantastic and so was the food!  Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the Masala Kraft. Food was"
On a brief visit to Mubai we spent a welcome hour here in the Harbour Bar. It was very cool after the heat of the city and the cool drinks were very welcome. This is a very high class hotel and is rather like an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Mumbai.
"This will hands down be my #1 favorite hotel stay ever! For starters, the building is absolutely gorgeous! My husband and I booked a room in the Old Tower and we were upgraded to higher suite. It was hands down super goregous with beautiful views. This suite included a living/seating area with a big flat screen tv. An office space which was slightly secluded from the other rooms and then a dining area. Then our bedroom was sperated from the other rooms and very spacious with a king sized bed. The bathroom was the most beautiful bathroom I'Ve seen in a while it had double sinks one to the far left and the other to the far right. A beautiful antique-like bathtub in the middle of the room. Two wardrobe closets and another room which had the toilet and the shower.   The staff was"
"This is a wonderful hotel, the attention to detail is fantastic. Lovely to walk around, friendly and helpful staff.  Great Location.  I cannot recommend it enough. If you're going to Mumbai this is definitely the place to stay."
"This is my second time to the Taj Mahal. It is a beautifully situated hotel with a lovely outlook over the ocean.  The staff are so friendly and helpful - probably the best I've ever experienced. The hotel itself is very beautiful and fully equiped from a gym, pool and fabulous rooms. Highly recommend!"
"One of the best hotels in the world, amazing service. Food is fantastic, probably the most elaborate breakfast buffet I ever witnessed. Popular with foreign guests and local vips and celebreties alike, A true classic grand hotel experience."
"last year I have the pleasure of being booked in to this hotel, I had read several tripadvisor comments all good, they should have all stated great and this is a great hotel from check in to the standard of the room to check out, everryone I met was very profesional, the building and court yard and very stylish no time to try the food in the hotel can only expect it would be about the same  stayed in room 301, very quiet due to the solding structure of the building  will come back on my next visit to London"
"We can only recommend this hotel. This was our third stay in the Taj. The accommodation, the service and the food were excellent, as usual. The location of the hotel is very convenient for South Mumbai."
I stayed at the Taj on 19 June. Prior to arriving I was not expecting so much as I had booked at the lowest room rate available in the Tower Wing. Overall the stay was highly enjoyable. I really valued the friendliness of each member of the hotel staff. It is likely I will return in future as the hospitality given is unlike any other hotel I have stayed in in India. Thankyou Taj for such an enjoyable stay.
"Probably the most amazing hotel I've ever stayed in. It's stunningly beautiful, the service is out of this world, lots of little touches that you hardly notice happening make staying here very special. I mentioned in my booking it was my husbands birthday and on arrival we were upgraded to the palace wing and had cake and decorations delivered. The pool is really lovely, great to escape from the busy streets of Mumbai. We also tried the bars and the masala Kraft restaurant, both fantastic. It is expensive but it's definitely worth it! "
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai. I had stayed there about 25 years ago and I was curious to see how it is again. We had to wait for quite a bit at reception but then we were surprised with the most magnificent upgrade. We were given one of the corner suites. It was gorgeous. We had our own sitting room, office and dining room. What a pity we had to leave after only one night. The pool is beautiful and gives you the peace one needs after a hectic day in Mumbai. The service was excellent and the restaurants are extremely good. We would definetley stay there again."
"Does this hotel require a review; probably not. It is simply the best hotel in Mumbai for its unmatched hospitality, excellent location and superb view. Even though I live in Mumbai, I (and my wife in particular), wanted to always wanted to stay at this iconic property. We chose to celebrate my son's birthday and it turned out to be an absolute pleasure. We had booked a sea-view room in the Palace Wing, which is the old and classy part. They upgraded us to the higher category and as soon as we entered, the feeling was ecstatic with our window giving a spectacular view of the Gateway and the Arabian Sea. They also sent a cake for my birthday boy and a nicely made pasta, another of his favourite. Alongwith the room came an access to the Palace Lounge with 24-hours tea/coffee and"
"We arrived early afternoon to the taj palace where we were wished by all the staff. It didn't feel like anyone was stuck up with an attitude. We even had the secuirty man wish us namaste which was pretty warm as he was our first point of greet as we entered the hotel. Further as we waited in the lobby for our check in we were welcomed with a chain of flowers and a tikka . It felt very ethnic and truly welcoming in the taste of india.  You would love the welcome especially if u have come from out of india.  The rooms very clean and pleasant. . However a little small and we expected better interiors .. something different from other hotels, i guess taj lacked there ( we booked the normal standard room) The bathroom was pretty small too and lacked a bidet, which may be of an"
"Good facility with excellent staff. only one thing is  i not found as per my expectation that is taj does not have buffet dinner. otherwise everything is well maintained well like lobby, pool area, rooms etc. when we reached there we got a worm welcome by Taj staff. children's were also happy with the welcome."
"Can't find any sort of fault with the Taj. After having bathed (metaphorically) in its sumptuous lobby and photographed it inside out multiple times, I thought it would be a good idea to sample for myself what all the talk is about. Ignoring the polite offer of an airport pick-up (approximately 20x the cost of a regular cab and basically doubling the cost for a single night), I made my way on a muggy May night to the perfectly-serviced front desk and checked in in less than record time. My luggage was upstairs within the next 10 minutes. An extravagant room service Club sandwich later (approximately 50x the cost of a similarly delicious meal outside), I was ready to sample the pleasures of the comfy bed, and luxurious surroundings. Did I mention I was on the 19th floor of the"
"1. A mazing hotel with a lot of activities, swimming pool. 2. Good staff, they show their best from the day of arrival to the day of leaving. 3. Excellent service, what ever you request you get it. 4. Excellent location, it is located in COLABA road, where you can get a lot of shops around you. 5. Finally, I traveled a lot but my experience in this hotel will stay in mind."
Amazing place i realy like it and i suggest it to every one ro visited...environment was good an decoration was extra ordinary and the place of palace was perfect...rooms are spacious and foos was exelent ...we wll come back
"Was fortunate enough to visit this place on a business meeting, everything you would expect in a 5 star hotel and more in my opinion I'd say it's the best in south east Asia. Worth every penny you really are treated like a maharaja in the Taj Palace."
"Taj mahal and towers is an outstanding property of taj group of hotels , staff is polite and helping and the ambience is excellent , I would like stay at this hotel always .. best location and amazing sea view"
"This place could be my favorite hotel! Just incredible from beginning to end. Perfect hospitality in every imaginable way. Gorgeous hotel located in the heart of the tourist sights of Mumbai. My room was perfect. Amazing bed, amazing views, great bathroom. Delicious breakfast that was good each day! Spent three nights here and just loved the place! Will go back again and again!   Sandeep who turned my room down, was a master of hospitality for sure! Highly recommend this place to anyone!"
"Luxirious hotel facing sea and gateway for india. Retaurant and food were superb. Arrival experience was awesome. Staff was very prompt and courteous.  Fanstastic service, Highly recommended to anyone visiting to mumbai."
"Situated at the downtown location in Mumbai overseeing Arabian sea, Taj Mahal hotel, Mumbai, particularly its Heritage Wing, is excellent value for money.  Very helpful and courteous staff, excellent reception and promptness are the features of Taj Group.  120 years of hotel history linked with history of India's freedom fight, is apparent everywhere in your stay."
"Stunning architecture, wonderful staff, delightful food and plenty of options (midn you I eat extremely healthy and i found the food great!). The Fitness Center small but okay there was a trainer called ""Imtiyaz"", who is great and gives a free streching, which i totally recommend especially if jet lagged! I was a solo woman traveler and i found the hotel and the location very safe. I actually walked around the area on my own sometimes."
"Excellent hotel with great location .Beautifull  room .  Speedy check in . Warm welcome ,Nice  and  helpfull  staff ,  spotless and very clean, , Value for money We relly Enjoyed our stay. Hope to come back and stay in same hotel next time.."
From booking to check in to dining experience to check out ...Fabulous!!! The staff are so well trained that any question about the hotel  is promptly answered - even if it is a housekeeping staff. Dining at the Souk was really nice - the rooftop view of the bay is amazing!!
"As one of the featured guests on the BBC documentary about this hotel, it is always fun to return for a visit. Imagine my pleasant surprise when the girls did a collage of myself with the Bollywood Stars i have met over the years.  It was left as a surprise in my room. This is what makes 'Hotel India' the best in the world!"
"Celebrated my anniversay at the Taj and I couldnt have made a better decision. They spoiled us rotten with cakes, flowers and wishes all around. Stayed in the City Wing (Sea Facing) with a majestic view of the Gateway of India. I could ideally just sit in that balcony staring out. Every time we stepped out, we returned to something new in the room whether it was balloons, or cake. Kudos to Zeena G'Douza and a helpful reservation agent (cant rem his name) who planned the whole thing for forgetful me. They took pictures of us, and created a brilliant collage in the room for us.  Really special, extremely customized and looked perfect.  The entire staff and service is just excellent. The place is amazing for its history but more for its people.   Go there for the service, for the"
"I thought I had done 5 star before but I hadn't. This place was unique - the attention to detail, the quality of the palace wing rooms, the astonishing levels of service and the incredible quality of the food simply blew my mind and were worth every penny.  In terms of improvements I can't think of many:  -Perhaps more information on the famous guests who had stayed - a map of the hotel and all of its services would have been useful - also they offer a free foot spa in your room some nights and it would have been amazing to have had it every night - some of my services were a little expensive, especially compared to other local prices (£40 airport transfer compared to £6 in an uber)  However I'm clearly clutching at straws. My trip was near perfect and it has inspired me to come"
"Had a dinner at the Shamiana restaurant of the hotel. Really sumptuous food with great ambience. The lobby provides many options for some small shopping. Location is perfect, with gateway visible from most rooms"
Went to taj and there were 2 single beds in a couple room this is something I was not expecting from a brand like Taj. Other overall experience was very good. The breakfast buffer was awesome enjoyed it to the core
"The Taj Palace Hotel (the old wing) in Bombay is simply outstanding! Combines the old world charm & hospitality with modern amenities and excellent service! I have been a Taj customer whenever I travel, but this hotel was beyond excellence. It is truly one of the Grande hotels of the world!"
Taj Mahal Palace made sure the Birthday celebration was made special with an upgrade. Room decked up for birthday and cake after dinner. The staff is very warm and friendly. The bar has a great collection and the food at Souk was good.
"There is nothing beyond perfection. Similarly, there is nothing beyond Taj Mahal palace hotel. Does it need more descriptions in the review ? ;) Awesome is the only word for this property. Just go there and enjoy. Rest, the staff will take care of everything !!"
The best of the hospitality one can experience. A touch of Taj brand. Extra care for our wedding anniversary with decoration in the room and special cake at dinner and at room. An experience one can cherish for long long time
Taj is like wonder to us and as well as taj hotel.public was shocked after seeing that hotel. It was a nice property with brands too like Louis vuitton . It was a awesome view from room window aS well
"We love India and wanted to explore Mumbai.  We treated ourselves and stayed at The Taj for 8 beautiful days.  The Taj is located in a very good area near loads of landmarks, places to eat and some shopping (of which we did loads)  I have travelled the world and stayed in many hotels... and I have to say The Taj has the best service I have ever experienced!    Staff we helpful, friendly and efficient.   We had the afternoon 3 times food was fantastic as well as the breakfast.  I am dreaming of the day I can return!"
This is a beautiful property to stay you will never go wrong and good service. You have all the facilities available so you are not wasting your time on unforeseen circumstances. Also the rooms are well furnished with all the latest amenities
"Nobody could have prepared you for the most relaxing,professional and ultermate service from everyone at this hotel. This hotel has set the best bench market for hotel hospitality and all the leading hotels should have their teams trained here. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and to be asked in advance of our preferences was an added bonus. I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending to anyone that you should make this your first choice for a hotel stay. We cannot wait to visit once again."
"Booked this hotel after watching the BBC hotel India. Going to be brutally honest here. The type of experience you have really depends on what type of room you book. Do not expect the five star experience as shown on the programme if you book and stay in a Tower room as we had booked.  Firstly did not receive a warm or friendly welcome by reception staff. After a 10 hour international journey a smile would have been nice.  I was a little shocked when entering our room at how dated it was and in comparison to the rest of the hotel it smelt musty and stale. At best I would class the room three star. Restaurants , pool are and bars were all top class as we're most of the staff.  Although I would not stay here again I'm glad we went . You can however have the same experience if you"
"Lovely hotel, good staff. Not quite on a par with other hotels in India (this is a local comparison not a world wide one!).  3 days later we are still waiting for our welcome drinks to come to our room... this wouldn't happen elsewhwere.  Views of the Gateway are fantastic.  Pool is great and warm.  Lots of restaurant choice.  Free standard wifi throughout hotel - speed is perfect."
We were there to celebrate my husband's birthday planned as a surprise gift to him by my daughter. The surprise was well shared by the most pleasant and courteous hotel staff. We stayed in Tajmahal Palace wing which in itself I find very nostalgic. I love the decor and the artifacts on display.  We had a very sumptous high tea in 'Sea Lounge' which was a very relaxing experience. The staff knew about the incoming birthday. This personalised service was very heart warming. They looked after all the guests very well.  The Birthday surprises were duly delivered and photographs were taken by staff at that time. The photos were then printed and given promptly. Breakfast  too was very good spread with food made to order as well. Sambar and Rasam were particularly tasty.  Check in and
"A stay here will put you in the mindset of a Raj from long ago: first class service, luxurious accommodations and excellent food.  The staff was extremely helpful in making our two-day series of business meetings a huge success."
"Just spent a relaxing weekend at The Taj in the middle of a hectic business trip and  I have to put it up there with the best hotels I have ever stayed in , it scored maximum for me on every level .I had heard a lot about the hotel and if anything it exceeded my expectations which is very rare event nowadays.  The personal service was excellent without being  over imposing ,it was natural gift or result of  good training with all the staff on a consistent basis  and always with a smile. The ambience of the hotel is wonderful an oasis of calm with the crazy World of Mumbai left at the gates . The rooms in The Tower are very comfortable and well appointed , a room with big picture window overlooking the Gateway of India added to the feeling of being in a special place. My"
Good location plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.Beautiful décor throughout. Great View of the India Gate from the Tower room albeit the rooms in this block are a bit small. Excellent buffet breakfast.  Pools and gym facilities very good. Highly recommend this hotel.
"Having grown up just round the corner from this place, I was so excited about returning. The hotel is outstanding in every way. Service always with a smile. Just simply loved every minute we spent here."
We had a truly memorable weekend stay at the Taj. We had been automatically upgraded and were in a beautiful room in the heritage Palace Wing. The Tower seems to be undergoing some renovation from outside. the view from the room was of the poolside.. lovely well maintained rooms.. the staff was amazing.. very smooth check in and check out experience.. we enjoyed swimming in the pool and had a little snack by the poolside as well.. the butler was very efficient and our needs were addressed immediately.. all in all we loved our stay and will definitely stay there again and recommend to others as well..
"Having stayed in different cities across globe and at other star Hotels in Mumbai , I should rate this as the Best in terms of the Grandeur and Hospitality. I am amazed by the enthusiasm of the staff and which reflects in the warmth & courtesy they extend to their guest .  We were made to feel very special since arrival"
Great hotel and such an iconic building! This hotel is great to be a base or to relax in! The hotel has a stunning pool and spa and is great to make you feel like a human again. We used this hotel as a pit stop for back packing but was also great to explore the city in! The room size cleaning and standards all great! Do visit!
"Upon our arrival we were immediately upgraded. We were treated like royalty and had such an incredible time. High tcocktail hours, buffet, cognac and chocolate... The list goes on. It made our stay better than we could have dreamed. The service was friendly and very generous. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!!!"
We stayed here for a day . From inviting the guest with a garland  everything  was a  wonderful service and had a memorable stay. Enjoyed the pool  and the evening heritage walk which was informative and interesting. The staff took extra care at every stage. Very nice
"If you only do this kind of holiday once ,you will remember it. 5*@its finest. Food is excellent, staff attentive. Celebrated my 50th, &stayed for 10days . Went on a escorted tour with driver. Visited Ghandi's house,water garden,train station etc. The whole experience was magical. Took so many photos as always something that capture of my holiday. Poolside is lovely just to sit by &let the world go by. Restaurants will cater for all your needs,no matter what your palate is. Select Palace side rooms as it faces the gateway of India."
"What more can be written about this magnificent hotel; who would not love to be staying here. On our arrival we were upgraded to Club Heaven Thank you so much! For five days we did not leave the hotel, there was no need . After a long tiring tour we felt we were being personally pampered, even a foot spa every evening to sooth our tired feet. Everywhere offers an oasis of sheer elegance, whether it's the pool area, the lounges, even the corridors . We were so impressed by the impeccable service throughout the hotel, this is the magic of the Taj . Everyone who works there is responsible for the true heart beat of this hotel . We we're overcome when our butler Adrian took time out to escort us to our car , and wave us goodbye! It just does not get better than that! We hope the Taj"
We  a warm welcome in the hotel.We were  upgraded to palace room.It is was great experince to stay in palace wing. Very caring staff especially for children. Good view of gateway of india & sea good swimminig pool
"We were newlywed staying at Taj Mahal palace  The billing staff could have handled the situation in a much better way.  Me n my wife were hurt and disappointed  Very poor service n inconsiderate staff We ordered dinner in the room and paid for it in the room itself, the room service happily accepted the bill amount and left.  The next morning We had the worst checkout, the staff claimed we had to pay for the dinner, I explained that I had already paid. The billing staff refused to believe me and we had to wait till they contacted the room service person, the staff at the billing was curt and made us wait 45 min to complete the billing. It was very unpleasant for both of us.  The billing staff could have handled the situation in a much better way.  Me n my wife were hurt and"
"Service wise, only Baros, Maldives and The Upper House in Hong Kong compare out of all the luxury properties I've stayed at (there have been a few on every continent).  And I do believe that The Taj Mahal Palace might well take the top prize service wise (with Baros, Maldives a close second).  You feel like royalty here and every detail is attended to. Considering the price difference between this property and The Upper House, you also realize that it's genuinely a feat in managerial and staff brilliance - a deep, deep pride in offering you the very best of the best.  The property has a tragic recent history (as well as rich general history).  Perhaps partly because of this (like Baros has to make up for its proximity to Male and the trash burning island), The Taj Mahal Palace"
I have travelled extensively  and stayed in many of the exclusive hotels around the world.  Taj Mahal is far the best hotel I have stayed in.  Not only because of the location and deco. Because of very single of the staff is friendly and respectful.
"I was so looking forward to indulging myself as a Taj member in the splender of the Palace Wing after a brief illness.   Imagine my surprise when arriving at checkin I received a completely off hand welcome to being provided with a room that had been painted the day before with fumes remaining, and incorrect details of my credit card being inserted requiring me to be very embarrassed by my bank declining the card.   These mistakes are completely unacceptable causing me to incur substantial additional costs and made me feel very vunerable as a solo female traveller.  On the plus side, the hotel is beautiful, most of the staff are attentive and attend to your needs. The rooms are clean and well catered for.  The hotel did try to rectify some of my issues.  However for a hotel of"
"Started our evening at Sea Lounge with French fries and masala chai, then ordered cake at La pasterie mixed fruit pastry and dinner at Souk .. Overall had a nice time and it means a lot to me. Stepping in Taj Mahal palace was a dream and came true today. Beautifully built, awesome service kudos to teAm "
We were booked at the tower wing but we're upgraded to the palace wing as there was some drilling work happening above our room. The room with a view of the gateway and the sea was excellent. The room the service was really excellent. The spread at breakfast time at the sea lounge was good too.
"I had been there for 2 nights in this hotel. It is an amazing hotel which attracts you at first sight. It takes you back to the old British days when it comes to see it. This was the best service that i had ever taken till now. The service was so quick and the food was also served very nicely. The food was so delicious and it had a lot of variety to enjoy. Even the staff, the room and the amenities were luxurious and welcoming. This is such a nice place to stay in with a front facing sea which adds to the beauty of this hotel. It is the best hotel to live in. Everyone must visit this hotel if there comes a chance for a visit to Mumbai."
"This jewel of Bombay makes no excuses for being an epitome of luxury and opulence.  Upon reaching this marvelous palace, one gets the persuading feeling that ""you have arrived.""  From the pleasant check-in process to the brief introduction to this historical emblem of Mumbai, to the meticulous care in welcoming their guests, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel implicitly promises not to disappoint.  ""No second class anything "" would be an appropriate mantra for this oasis amidst the hustle and bustle of this gritty city.  For the best experience do opt for a room in the palace wing.  Then chill out and be pampered by the caring and friendly staff. "
Superb.  I had a good stay Good rooms Good food Good service. I did not have any complaints.... but i will definately want to go back there Poool was also wonderful they took very good care of my kids.... toys in the room etc.....  dont miss it.
This hotel out does itself with the level of service and comfort. It is beautiful in every sense and the staff go out of their way to make your stay that little bit extra wonderful. We were kindly upgraded to the Palace wing (I would book in this area myself next time) and each night there was a gift left in the room for us. The bed was so comfortable my husband and I slept so soundly each night. Instant hot water with the best pressure ever in the shower. Cant rave enough about the Taj Palace Hotel!
"Let me start by saying, there were 10 of us staying here for business for between 8 to 10 days, so this was not a night or two. Everyone, including myself, couldn't believe our luck. The iconic Taj Palace. But as one of my team capped it towards the end: 'it sounds impressive to say you're staying here; the experience, not so much. So let me start by saying, yes, the original building is stunning and well-maintained. The location is excellent if you want to be looking out over the Gateway to India, which our rooms did. The housekeeping, room service, spa, fitness and restaurant staff were very welcoming and professional. The front desk overall were also good. There were some nice touches. On Sundays, they leave a little dessert sample in your room. They also left me some"
"i stayed here for 2 nights for work. the ambience of the entire hotel, from the welcoming smiles of the staff, the impeccable service, the quality of the food, the attentiveness of the people around, and the little treats they give you - i had a super long day and when i got back to my room, there was a little foot spa waiting for me and it was such a thoughtful treat! and as i was leaving, one of the staff who was cleaning out the corridor ran off somewhere and then popped to me and passed me a little goodbye present which was a painting of hte Taj dome. what an absolute wonderful experience. i couldnt rate it any higher."
"Celebrated birthday of wife recently. Great response by the staff, they take extra care if you have come to celebrate any occasion. Every worth the penny spent. Hotel amenities and food are top notch. Swimming pool is probably the best I have seen so far in any hotel. Highly recommended."
Trip to Mumbai is not complete if you have not stayed at The Taj. from the moment we walked into this hotel my wife & I felt what a wonderful place this is - the architecture had the vow factor for us plus many other things.  The whole staff were very attentive and made our 30th wedding anniversary stay very special and we are already looking forward in returning to this magic place Thank you once again
As we entered Taj Mahal hotel we got this feeling of entering into a different world. This property has a different charm. It takes u back to the old British days. Thank god Taj had retained its charm. Our guest relationship manager was Zeena Dsouza. She took good care of me and my wife. Her recommendations were really nice. Especially about their rooftop restaurant (Souk) Also we cant forget the heritage walk tour of the hotel arranged by her. (It was free) So i recommend this place for those who really want to pamper them self into a fine luxury. We just cant wait to go there again.
"Sent my grand parents to this wonderful hotel for their anniversary and they were all praises for TAJ....every time I speak to them, they only talk about how the entire TAJ fraternity made their day special.   They made them cut a cake at the breakfast table, the rooms were decorated with balloons & flowers and were offered a late check out.....  My aim was to make sure they had a perfect anniversary by sending them to the best hotel in Mumbai and you guys did exactly what I wanted expected....thank you soo much...."
"Everything you've ever heard, read, seen or dreamt about the Taj Mahal Palace is true... and much, much, more..  We stayed for six exquisite days in this iconic establishment and would still be there now, had we been able to, but our vacation days had finished..  Arriving at a busy time in the lobby, we were quickly welcomed with sincere smiles and a very welcome drink. Check in for our club room was effected in the privacy of the Palace Lounge and we were escorted to our room on the sixth floor.  Luxury and attention to the minutest detail are the watchwords in the Taj, our room was perfect; very high quality furnishings, spotlessly clean bathroom with every conceivable facility to hand.   Daily breakfast in the Sea Lounge, choosing from an extensive buffet was a delight as"
Major attitude problem from the security officer Mr. Guru to the Duty Manager Mr. Arjaan. I happen to visit Taj at the gateway of India this evening with my family for dinner and may have also checked in. I happen to give my car to the vallet staff and proceded inside the hotel to meet a some of my guest in the lobby area. My family planned for a short walk to the gateway of India before our dinner planned at the golden dragon. We stepped outside the hotel and we were stopped by the security mentioning us if you are going outside the hotel you have to take your car along with you as there is not enough parking. I politely mentioned them that I have a planned dinner with family here in the hotel tonite and just going for a short walk. He insisted to take the car. This was a
"Went for my birthday this year in March for 2 nights , we were upgraded , then the staff decorated our room with balloons, and flowers , it was a lovely touch xx the staff are lovely and very helpful , also went in the history tour around the hotel which was very interesting , well worth a visit !! "
"We were lucky enough to first stay at this hotel earlier this year and totally fell in love with India and the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. So much so that we took out teenage son with us again last week so he could experience it himself.  I have to say that we do travel a fair bit as a family and stay in many marvellous hotels worldwide, but 'The Taj' is just so special. Our son thinks it was completely amazing in every way, and as a teenager his is not easily pleased....  We were very very lucky to be upgraded to The Palace Wing as we were returning guests, and it really is faultless in every way The butlers throughout the wing are just brilliant, they know what you want before you know yourself! The standard of cleaning was brilliant, and little touches like bookmarks put in books"
"What a fabulous experience. The hotel was a bit of history, a bit of elegance, with old world charm. We were pampered from the moment we arrived. The restaurant staff was exceptional, always eager to please and willing to go the extra step to make our breakfast special. When the manager heard my daughter was visiting a historical site and it was suggested by her guide that she bring a sandwich, he immediately appeared with a packed lunch. The pool staff was attentive. The taxi arranged by the hotel was waiting for us at the airport. Thank you for a memorable stay."
"said to be the tear on the face of the world. its more like a huge pearl. especially at sunset. its totally surreal. you have to wait a while to get the ""princess Diana"" photo but it's worth it. A bit scary trying to enter the dome. A small doorway and about a thousand people squeezing through it (all at the same time). but once inside it was worth the crush. The ""guides"" show you the stones set into the walls with a little torch then expect a tip. but that's India. I highly recommend the Taj Mahal but Agra the city is dirty and dangerous. don't stay too long!"
"Was such a wonderful experience from the moment we arrived to when we left! I travelled with my husband and 2 children they enjoyed all aspects of the staygrinning_face_with_smiling_eyes  Breakfast was delicious with alot of variety, there was alot of staff so you did not have to wait for service."
we spent two nights at The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai recently and chose this property for its reputation and location at the Gateway of India. The building and facilities are beautiful and well located within easy distance from many attractions and dining options. The Palace section still maintains its old charm and sophistication and the pool area is very beautiful and relaxing.  breakfast in Shamiana was superb. i just found the bathroom in the Towers section small but otherwise have no issues. Its a hotel I will visit in the future. 
"The iconic Taj Hotel has always been on my list of places to stay.   It did not disappoint, from the time we arrived to the time we left for the airport, I was unable to fault the service offered to us.   The ambience, the décor, the staff, the food, the room and the amenities were luxurious and welcoming in the heat and hussle of Mumbai.  Add it to your list of places to stay and you won't be disappointed."
"We loved the hotel because of the service. Very nice people, helpful and were able to solve a few challenges.  The location is very convenient!  We wish there were more electricity outlets. The low floors are quite noisy even on the sea view side."
Great Place to stay in mumbai. best location.best ambience. most courteous staff. impeccably clean.highly recommendable.although costly but worthy.one in a while splurge worthy. swimming pool very good .but no other recreational games for adults or kids like.snooker etc.
Epicure members should have access of stay at all the Taj properties all over India.    Dinner at Masala Craft Restaurant and Shamania  was pleasurable experience.   It was a great weekend stay. I look forward to my next visit soon.
"It may be cliche, but it was a great experience.  Off peak hours it is pretty easy to land a table near the window with a view of the Gateway to India monument. I got a great table even though I was dining alone.  For the best value in town, go for the formal tea services, about $25US including standard three tier silver tray and massive buffet of Indian delicacies. If you are budget constrained, just order a pot of designer tea and enjoy the ambiance.  Most of the menu items will immediately boost your bill to the same price as the formal tea service.   On the outside chance your are visiting by cruise ship, you can do this independently. The hotel is a very short taxi ride from the main port. I actually walked back and it took 20-25 minutes. Double check the time of the tea"
"After three weeks travelling around India with my daughter and her husband, by car, train and eventually plane (we couldn't face another overnight train journey) we arrived in Mumbai for a one night stay, which we considered as a reward, and a touch of luxury. It was everything we expected and more, and everything we had seen on the television in the series about the hotel, called Hotel India. We were treated like royalty despite arriving very early in the morning, about 6am, filthy and tired after another overnight journey on the train from Goa. We were taken into a beautiful lounge, given welcome drinks, non alcoholic cocktails followed by tea and coffee, all at no charge to us! They then upgraded our rooms to a Grand Luxury room with a sea view, and arranged for us to have"
"Overall stay in Taj was superb. This hotel is so rich, that it actually make you feel that you are king and leaving in palace. So many heritage sculptures and paintings. The book kept in palace lodge are amazing."
"Seven of us travelling and we were booked into the Palace suites. On arrival, all 17, yes seventeen pieces of luggage were collected by the staff and loaded onto one trolley. I was a a bit worried as my nice wanted to share a room with her aunt and mum and we thought that they would not accommodate three to a room. But need not have worried, they asked us if we would like an extra bed, however the bed being the size of a 5 a side football pitch it was fine. Lets start from the beginning: check-in, how pleasurable. You approach the front desk, then you are taken to the lounge away from the main reception and the formalities are completed. The bags were tagged and we were shown to our rooms after the customary draping of a garland of flowers and a bindi (thats a dot on your"
"What an amazing hotel, make sure you stay in the old part of this property, as its very very British Raj & grand, with an amazing swimming pool, nice and deep and cool.  Its also very pleasant to have breakfast adjacent to the pool."
amazing stay amazing hospitality amazing service perfect location perfect checkin perfect checkout outstanding in house facilities free hi speed wifi  we are very happy & satisfied with services will prefer to other guests to stay here once u will love it specially in old wing rooms
"There are many hotels in Mumbai, but only one is the Taj Mahal! You get 5 star treatment, as you would in any other 5 star hotel. But you have the additional benefit of the sheer history of the place to enjoy too! I stayed here for 3 nights after a long Ayurvedic treatment in the south of India - I deserved to be pampered. My room smelt a little damp, which I initially put down to the air conditioning. However, when I pointed it out to the concierge, I was immediately contacted by the manager's desk and moved to a different room.  It was a real disappointment not to be able to get a slot in the spa - that would have made the stay much more perfect. "
This was our first trip to India and we couldn't have picked anywhere better to start off.   We had chosen the hotel based on the documentary on it shown in the UK towards the end of last year so we had an idea of what to expect but it certainly didn't disappoint.  My one concern before arriving was that this would be more of a landmark and less of a hotel but this couldn't have been further from the truth. We were made to feel at home throughout our stay and there was never the feeling that there were hoards of people visiting just for a look around.  We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a club room on the 6th floor which meant that we got the advantages associated with such a room. Most notably we were able to partake in complementary afternoon tea and drinks in the Palace
had a blast! staff was very courteous and kind.  made us feel welcome.  the room was spacious and with lovely furniture.  extra comfortable beds and all the amenities one needs on a vacation.  cant wait to come back again and feel like royalty!
"i dropped in for coffee as my hotel was round the corner.  Although it was not cheap, the place was just beautiful, incredible staff, as obliging and helpful as I had heard.  It was a delight to sip my cappuccino overlooking the lovely pool garden.  Just perfect."
"My second time to stay here, the palace wing is fantastic. I can't comment on the Tower wing as I have not stayed there. This is what one of the best hotels in the world is supposed to be. Before in the winter, perfect to eat breakfast out by the most beautiful hotel pool in the world. This time in summer too hot, but that's not the hotel's fault. Service, Rooms no matter what level, food is fantastic. Will alsways stay here in Mumbai"
Greta Place to stay. An exciting experience one must never miss. The staff are great. Very helpful and nice. The location is beautiful next to the sea and the beautiful Gateway of India. Lot of places to visit around especially restaurants.
"I had a wonderful stay at the hotel for a week as a part of my training programme. My wife and daughter joined me towards the end of the same. A single word to describe the stay was ""Delightful"". The property (heritage wing) precedes the Gateway of India and a tour of the same (offered every evening) is a must do. Enjoy the art, the check in windows of the Air India and see the nuances in the architecture. If you are travelling with a child - room service is an experience. My daughter was convinced that she was being served a ""Princess Dinner"". She was more distraught to leave the hotel than return to Bangalore. Other activites around the Taj include the various cafes and eateries around, and a sail. Based on the size of the group you could charter a boat. We got this done"
This is a true 5 star hotel.  The service was faultless a large choice of restaurants and lots of places to relax. If you are going to stay pay the extra and stay in the Taj Club and experience traditional luxury.
"I always enjoy my trips to Mumbai that include a stay at the Taj Palace.  Everything about it, from the service to the great rooms and common areas is wonderful. They really go out of their way to make the stay great and there is a lot of attention to detail."
"Perfect Location for Sightseeing. Very tastfull, comfortable and clean rooms. Traditional and stylish Hotel. Extremly helpfull and friendly staff; every request got fulfilled. Nice decoration (art, flowers) all over the Hotel."
"The hotel is exceptional on so many levels.  The location is second to none.  The building from the outside is stunning. The views on the Gateway to India are the best in Mumbai.  The decoration is tasteful and classy.  The service is impeccable. All employees, from the security staff at the entrance to managers are smily and courteous and friendly.  The breakfast is extensive and varied.  The pool is amazing! deep and long and wide and not busy. The room has all amenities you can need and if it is not there, they will bring it!  The restaurants are top notch!  All in all, one of the best hotels you can stay at!  Big thank you to Taj."
"We spent 4 nights in a double en suite room at the Taj Mahal Tower during our honeymoon in January.  The room was spacious and comfortable, with a small balcony overlooking the gateway of India – we recommend spending extra on a sea view.  The staff (pre-warned!) made us feel very welcome by adding some special honeymoon touches to the room.  The service was impeccable throughout our stay. We highly recommend the 5 o’clock hotel tour – a lively and interesting introduction to the hotel’s heritage and some insights into Mumbai’s and India’s histories too.  We visited a couple of the restaurants and bars, which was a lovely way to explore the hotel, but the food was very expensive and not amazing, so if we stayed again we would give the restaurants a miss – there are loads of"
"This is clearly one of the better hotels in India. Excellent facilities, including gym which is un-Indian good, the gorgeous pool with adjacent bar and with 10 restaurant you never get bored. Nevertheless I rate it 4 stars (4.5 is what I had in mind). The rooms are small, the corridors smell a little old and the location is not optimal. For the latter, check where you need to be before booking as it's far from the airport and many businesses in the newer parts of town. I was lucky this time with only a 70 minute drive from the airport. It can be a lot worse. Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing hotel, especially the old building is nice (I was in the tower). Also, the hotel has fantastic art on display. Just for that, and the pool, a stay is certainly warranted. Finally, the"
"I have stayed in many fabulous hotels all over the world but this one certainly rates as one of my top 3 - the management here need an award for the best run hotel - everything runs like clockwork. I stayed on the 5th floor of the main hotel - I saw the rooms in the tower (the main hotel is certainly the best of the two. Breakfast in the main restaurant can be a bit of a bun fight in the morning and gets quite busy - I had mine in the Sea Lounge - which has great views and is much more pleasant for a good breakfast. The hotel is elegant, stylish and sophisticated without being in your face and at all times I felt welcome - The service is simply outstanding and just can not be faulted.  I will definitely be back. Simply brilliant!"
"It was fun filled & leisure weekend @ Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai, Kids had all the fun, we checked in very late, around midnight, they didn't sleep till 5 am in the morning. My mom had a good night sleep & my wife was on Watsapp group, posting the calm & quiet Gateway Of India snaps, @ 4am in the morning  (we got a sea view room on 19th & 17th floor)....Had a sumptuous breakfast in the morning...good spread... Long story short, it was yet another kewl weekend, will be back soon for more...."
"Hotel is absolute class. Service, location, history, everything! The restaurant on top floor was s little disappointing but can't take anything from hotel. And gateway to India is just across the road! Pool is great too. Great spot to stay in Mumbai! "
We had a very pleasant stay. Everybody was very nice and helpful. Thank you Lubna for making our wedding anniversary a special one! Thank you Anil for your excellent house keeping. Thank you Saurav Sharma for delivering great service in the Tea    Lounge.
"Taj Mahal place is fast becoming my favourite place for a weekend getaway within the city. We have lived in the tower and on the palace side too. The palace side is definitely the more royal and tricks you into feeing like royalty as u walk down the grand staircase. The location of this hotel is fabulous as you are a stones throw away from the best restaurants in the city and most of the iconic landmarks that define Mumbai. Excellent service, a lovely pool and some of the best restaurants within the hotel clearly make it a winning choice "
"Have stayed at this hotel many, many times and it maintains a consistently fantastic standard. I was thereto simmer again and the staff, room and facilities are amazing. The room is just magical, peaceful and heavenly and gives the comforts you would wish for.  The Butler service is so very efficient with nothing being too much trouble. Thanks again!"
This was a nice stay and very attentive staff. The rooms and all were nice and clean with the service level top notch. I think the price is reasonable for the quality (by European standards as this is an important point). However the extras here are outrageously priced. Over €15 for a mojito at the pool is outrageous in my opinion.
I have stayed here a few times and it is all round excellence with great service and with Gateway to india just outside the front door you are right where you want to be for everything. Breakfast fine but can be busy.A lot of arabs stay here and Burkas are everywhere so breakfast can be a bit of a zoo. We tried the chinese and it was not good and way off good chinese so be careful and go out if you need a china fix We booked to come back and the hotel is highly recommended
"service friendly and  impeccable a five star hotel that makes a solo female  traveler feel looked after and secure in a big city, even provided total assistance to post 3 boxes out of Mumbai PO, Location good , provided experience drivers and airport pickup at a cost but worth it."
"Instead of hotel, its a Must Visit Place. Specially the heritage tour which briefs you about the Taj Mahal an its legacy. Life time experience.  The location, hospitality and legacy tells you that you are also becoming the part of it. Various memorable paintings, art gallaries, shopping inside the Mahal and many more things to feel."
"In such a chaotic city, a little bit of calm.  An amazing city and perfect hotel.  Definitely worth paying for a palace room overlooking the gateway to India  We stayed in the taj suite which included some very nice touches, afternoon tea, cocktail hour etc. the pool area was well maintained with plenty of cold water readily available.  Staff were amazing and always on hand to assist. The chauffeur car from the airport was also a nice touch. Food in the hotel was normal 5* prices but if you walk around the corner from the hotel there is many places to eat. The tasting menu in the Japanese restaurant was one of our highlights, you can see why it's in the top 100 restaurants in the world.  Only down side was the amount of non residents wondering around but as to be expected with"
"Amazing hotel with so many different restaurants. It was a great place to be at Taj,  Quality of each item in the hotel from entrance till the room/ restaurance is very high. With lot of thinking around it.  There is a feel of India in the place.  Reception is enourmous and with old antics (master pieces) all over the hotel.  There is richness and food quality is also very good. We celebrated anniversory in this hotel and it was a wonder full time."
"My partner and I stayed 2 nights at the Taj last year prior to jumping on a cruise ship out of Mumbai. The Taj is like an oasis after being in the Mumbai traffic and trying to walk down the dirty, noisy,  busy streets of Mumbai!! We arrived quite late at night and were greeted by a concierge lady who sorted out our luggage through the security barriers at the front of the hotel. (implemented after the bombing in 2008) and took us straight up to our room. Quite a standard room but with a small balcony and the usual items in a 5 star hotel. Great room service, very quick and attentive staff!. We had a nice view of the pool and she organised cold towels and a welcome drink! We slept soundly and woke up to the usual muggy humid weather in Mumbai. We checked out the hotel and saw all"
As always the Taj Mahal and Palace hotel lives up to its reputation of being a Home away from home. Vibrant as the city it is situate in ...Bombay!!  An Excellent reception and a warm send off......always leaves one with a feeling of wanting to go back.
"Amazing hôtel and gorgeous main building. I stayed on the Taj Club level with all amenities you can just image. Access to the Palace Lounge all day long for refreshing or cookies. 18:30, cocktails and win with hors-d'oeuvres, 20:30, cognac and chocolate....all Taj Club guets have access to the luxury treatments. Restaurants are incroyably extensive but the taste and the quality was there. Negative point, the red wine was to warm to the Wasabi restaurant. Excellent  service. Easy check-in and check-out. Wonderful pool for resident of the main building only. Best to a room on the street side or face to the Gateway of India for klaxon sound always present in Mumbaï. Highly recommanded!"
"Had a great time staying here . And boy-o-boy it was gr8..... Great people great interiors and ofcourse experienced royalty of the place . I realised why this place is called the crown of mumbai.I had the incredible opportunity to stay at this historical gem for two nights in December 2014 with my mother as part of our tour of India. Firstly, my genuine respect and appreciation to esteemed General Manager Mr. Gaurav Pokhariyal for overseeing and setting the vision for a world class hotel and detailed attention and accommodation of hotel guests! Furthermore, my appreciation to Shamiana's Assistant Manager, Mr. Akshay Mirajkar, and Deputy Housekeeper, Ms Shruti Daruka, for taking such good care of mother me and affording us many special touches that made our experiences so very"
"Fantastic hotel, impeccable service! Dining options are expensive but avoid in room dining! Restaurants serve far better food and you would be spoilt for choice for dining options!  Many dining options right outside the hotel on the back side including street food and many fine dine options too incase you wish to save a buck!"
"This is among the most enduring experiences you can have - a hotel which carries the tag Palace quite easily, overlooking the Gateway of India & the expanse of the Arabian Sea. This luxury property has heritage intertwined with a tinge of the tragic.   Spent four lovely days with the family and had a great time. When they knew about the special occasion, starting with e-welcome & personal calls, they went out of their way to pamper us without being intrusive. Timeless elegance is the hallmark of this hotel and its aura. "
"We Stayed at the Taj last week for the third time this week. Everything was great as usual until we came to check out.  I got a text from my bank confirming the Credit Card payment just after I had completed the transaction- but NOT for the amount agreed in my confirmation.  Further investigation proved that the Hotel was making a massive 6% on the currency exchange rate. On challenging this I was told it was the Hotel's Bank and not the Hotel that was making the charge. A lame excuse - the end result was the same -  I ( the customer) was still faced with a hidden 6% charge ! I wonder how many Billions of Rupees the Hotel ( or its Bank) are making each year from this sharp practice. Very, very poor."
Had a great time staying here . And boy-o-boy it was gr8..... Great people great interiors and ofcourse experienced royalty of the place . I realised why this place is called the crown of mumbai . great place and was able to meet many celebs...

The hotel is dream-like, filled with hallways full of stunning art work, and one can't avoid being swept up in the grandeur and history!  I really strongly recommend you try your best"
"Walking into a palace in a place like southern Mumbai was like nothing I ever could have dreamed of. As you walk in, the air conditioning hits you, and you feel a chill throughout your body. If it was the upgrade that occurred, or the fact that every staff member smiles and asked how you are every time you walk by. Or maybe the fact that every corner has a restaurant that smells like heaven. The pool area is spectacular and the shower in the room was incredible. I have nothing derogatory to say about the palace as it was just wonderful!"
must try Biryani :D It is just awesome...with the great taste comes the aromatic flavours which tingles your senses and makes it an memorable dish to savour.  Plus the hospitality and the service is outstanding.
"This place is like my second home,  I cannot imagine mumbai without this place.  From service to luxury all well worth.  My favorite is either shamiana restaurant or by the pool side! Nothing better than a glass of chardonnay with pudina prawns!"
This has been my best hotel experience ever. highly recommended for both business and pleasure.  The stay in the Palace with the butler service is one not to skip.  Food was excellent and the overall service was outstanding
"This was my first stay in India and may I say what a delight to stay at the Taj Palace.  This is truly a wonderful hotel in the heart of Mumbai which truly captures the ambiance of Mumbai and is serviced by extremely professional, cheerful and dedicated staff."
"you are visiting mumbai you must stay in this hotel excellent location,near by  street shopping,lot of happening place near by,good night life.good restaurant ,hospitality excellent,near all business center , over all i give full marks to stay"
"Though the stay was limited to be just over a day, it was well worth the time we spent in the hotel.  The hospitality extended by the staff and the comfort was exactly what we wanted in the midst of a busy official schedule of meetings and site visits at Mumbai. Well deserved to come back on my next trip."
"Who so ever visit must try tea  which is the speciality of Taj  , food is very good ,room service well in time,restaurant is very good with good preparation all round hospitality very good, we try 24 hours food which was well in time and quality was good"
"I stayed in various hotels in Mumbai but this is my favourite. Make sure you stay in the Palace Wing and enjoy the ambience. Rooms are designed with taste and equipped with top shelf amenities. Everything works and the service is great.  Taj Mahal is unique with its architecture and the flair of the great stair case, the sea lounge, the garden..."
We stayed two night in the Tower part of the hotel which was absolutely wonderful. The room was decked out in balloons and rose petals and a beautiful flower arrangement was left too. We mostly ate in the hotel as we did not feel confident eating out except one place in Fort. Our visit was broken by a trip to Jodhpur and on our return we were treated to the Palace side of the hotel which is truly how you expect it to be with service being impeccable  
"Simply put, the Taj Palace in Mumbai is the finest hotel we've ever had the pleasure of staying at, and we've stayed at the finest all over the world.  There are none better.  Period.  Every conceivable facet of this hotel is nothing less than remarkable!"
This hotel is the perfect place to stay in Mumbai. You feel the cultural heritage.  Breakfast was excellent - from continental breakfast to indian cuisine you could find almost everything.  Housekeeping was also very attentive - putting rose petals on our bed and some relaxing amenities on our bedside table.  Sleeping Quality was very high - it was very quite and curtains were able to darken the room completely.
I strayed this hotel many times. Is great hotels fast WiFi really hot shower great location frandly staff cvvbbbbbbbbbbbbbnnnnnnnbbbbbbbbbbbbbggvvbbbvvbbbnbnnnnnnbbbbnbbbbbbbbbb hhfdddddddfffgggghhjjjjjjjhgggfffggggggggh.
"We stayed for 10 Nights in the Palace Wing we had a Sea View,our room was fabulous we were treated like Royalty nothing was too much trouble we had a Butler who was available 24 hours a day the hotel organise a Hertitage Walk around the inside the hotel which is very interesting and informative our favourite restaurant within the hotel is Golden Dragon serving Chinese food the food was delicious the service fantastic and decor was wonderful The hotel is opulent, beautiful we ate most lunchtime by the pool  good choice of food.Breakfasts were amazing,not forgetting the two shopping Arcades.Free wi-fi for 24 Hours."
This hotel is absolutely outstanding!  The service is unbeatable and the food at the resturant is amazing. I ordered chicken curry with rice and I have never tasted anything like it before...it was delicious! The hotel is exceptionally clean with a beautiful poolside. I would definitely recommended this hotel to everyone as there is nothing like it elsewhere!
"Hotel stands up to its name, excellent service, clean rooms you fell like a Maharajah in the hotel. The rooms are clean and well managed, quite rooms, excellent quality price. Good for couples, did not see a lot of kids but good for family stay also."
"Everything about this stay was amazing.  We set up a car from the hotel before our arrive to pick us up from the airport and this experience couldn't have been smoother.  The driver was exactly where he said he'd be with a sign with our last name on it.  He immediately took our bags and escorted us to an air conditioned car complete with some waters, moistened towels and sweets.  He described everything we were passing by on our drive which was extremely interesting.  Upon our arrival, our bags were taken to our room and our check in was done in our room with one of the staff members.  He showed us all of the features in our room and showed us the adapter that we had requested prior to our arrival.  He offered us beverages and took our credit card number and passports for copies"
"One of the best, if not the best, places to stay - anywhere. Service is unbeatable. Value for money excellent. Ambiance, style and comfort are just right for a relaxing 'escape'.  This hotel is very well known with a long standing high reputation which is fully justified. Having stayed at this hotel over 30 years ago it was very good to see that standards have stood the test of time."
The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is a fantastic hotel. I have stayed there several times in both the Tower and in the Palace wing. The service in the palace wing is very good and the rooms are clean and neat.  Unfortunately the rooms in the tower need an upgrade. The starboard bar is nice and has a good band The Zodiac as always has great food and the service is very good :)  The spa is also worth a trip and the same with having lunch by the poolside if you would like to feel special for some time stay a few nights at the palace wing.
"A luxury hotel with history, walking distance to main attractions. Very confortable swimming pool, very nice breakfast and welcoming staff. The hotel has a tour that show you the hotel, is worth it. Wifi is very good too."
"Wonderful stay here for 2 nights - beautiful hotel all round. Afternoon tea here is a must if you are staying at the hotel or staying in Mumbai. All round excellent staff, service, comfy rooms! Bit far out from shopping if that's what you plan to do but if you are just looking to relax and wind down after a hectic trip, this is the place to be."
"One of the best hotels to stay in Mumbai. A true gem, Excellent staff and clear rooms. Meals/restaurant are a bit on the expensive side and location is not the most ideal, so commuting to downtown BOM is a bit of a challenge especially in traffic. This is outweigh by the beautiful and clean rooms"
"Everything perfect. And more if possible. I think it is a marvelous experience, we just can do in India and not elsewhere, that means beauty, security, sense of hospitality  and respect for the privacy. All that for a very convenient price. I thinK Taj Mahal hotel is quite indian in the spirit: beautiful, generous and effective, the qualities that will help India to become one of the most important country in the world. We wait for this rebirth of India. it is time!"
"I saw many time this hotel from out side and when i decide to book a room my expectations was hight and lobby confirm that, but rooms are poor and traffic noice was strong even my room was at 10th floor.  Waiters and hotel staff are exelent and very kind. Swimming pool has a very nice location but traffic noice is very strong."
"The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai is the flagship hotel of the Taj Hotels, Resorts and Palaces. The Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) and its subsidiaries are collectively known as Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces and is recognised as one of Asia's largest and finest hotel company. This was built Jamsetji N Tata in 1903. British were not allowing Jamstji Tata or any Indians in their five star hotels and Jamsetji wanted to teach lessons to British by building this 5 Star hotel The Taj Mahal Palace a symbol of Indian hospitality. In 70s, the Company undertook major expansion of The Taj Mahal Palace by constructing an adjacent tower block and increasing the number of rooms from 225 to 565 rooms including 44 suites which are situated on the sea front and overlook the majestic Gateway of"
"We were invited for an official ceremony at Taj Mahal Hotel for presentations followed by cocktail and dinner. It was amazing- the decor, the people and overall ambiance- it was all superlative.  The pianist, who was playing melody was too good. The dinner was 7 course meal- served on the round tables. One can see the efficiency of staff who had to serve 200 odd guests simultaneously. It was like a clockwork precision and elegance. Nothing to tell about the food taste and choice of items- too good. It was a memorable experience."
"This is an exceptional hotel. The building is first class but the staff are even better. I would come back to Mumbai just to stay at this hotel. The quality of the rooms is excellent, a rare hotel where the central a/c is actually powerful enough for the room. The staff are immaculate in their courtesy. An absolute pleasure."
"Easily my favourite five star hotel experience ever! It was the complete package: gorgeous hotel, beautifully appointed suite, delicious food and fabulous service. Cannot wait to go back! My only complaint was that I was slightly disappointed with my massage in Jiva Spa."
"Excellent Had a great weekend at the Iconic Taj Mahal Palace Colaba. A great view of the Gateway Of India and the sea, Overwhelmed with the courtesy and the service extended to us by the entire staff during our stay at the hotel,it was world class, I had traveled with my family to celebrate a special moment, my parents were extremely happy and nostalgic throughout the stay, A must vist hotel when ever you are in Mumbai."
Value for money. Magnificient ambience which reminds us past historical indian glory. Homely food. Homely atmosphere. It was pleasure staying specially at Taj Mahal Palace. Harbour bar tooo.... good...
"Do not miss out staying at least one night in this hotel! Take the tour offered by the hotel and learn about it's history. You can enjoy each spot of the hotel for the art, the view and the atmosphere."
"We spent 3 days and 2 nights in March 2015 in the Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai, in the Tower part. The hotel was amazing. Prefer the sea side : the view is fantastic. We also had a very good dinner at the Indian restaurant Masala Kraft. We highly recommend !"
Stayed in a wonderful historic hotel. Staff were very polite and professional. The curries were delicious. Very handy to the financial district. Recreation areas around the pool and gym were very clean with modern facilities.
Had one night stay in May'15. Very good hotel. Nice to walk around and lots of places to eat outside as well. Hotel room was quite good although not the best i have stayed in. Hotel amenities were excellent.
"Stay:  If you dont get the rooms with sea facing or gateway facing view then it is not worth paying the price. I got a room which had horrible view of actually nothing. Apart from the view, the rooms are at par with other 5 star hotels so nothing extraordinary. Last time i visited i got an upgrade and upgraded rooms are much better. Business conference facility: The conference room was actually worst experience. The room was large and the projector and screen were not adequate. There was so much glare and shine coming that it was extremely difficult to view the screen. Additionally there is outside noise from the road (since our conference was on first floor road facing). Also the hotel had wedding on one of the days and it becomes extremely challenging for other guests with so"
"We had hired Taj's exclusive Rendezvous on 21st floor for the program held on 2nd and 3rd May, 2015, both days from 7 AM to 6 PM starting with breakfast, sessions by Raageshwari and Sunil Parekh on Silva Mind Method, Theta Healing, Taking charge of your Financial Blue Print and Powerful Mind Techniques to create your own Money Management System. The staff deputed by Taj Hotel to assist us worked hand in hand with us in organizing timely breakfast, lunch and tea breaks. They all put in yet lot of extra effort to turn the banquet hall into a siesta hall with bed-sheets and rolled up towels for head-rests, when Raageshwari conducted sessions of Theta Healing. We feel obliged and look forward to holding our up coming workshops there."
"Nearly everyone in India wants to help make your stay a happier one, but the staff at the Taj Mahal Palace seem to be able to read your mind and know what might be wanted even without you asking. Our stay was made extra special by the personal care."
"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in early May.  My room in the Palace part of the hotel was lovely and had a colonial atmosphere.  Overall the service and accommodation were very good.  I used the spa twice and would recommend Mary as a good masseuse.  Restaurants were a bit hit and miss.  Loved Souk, Masala Kraft was an interesting experience, Zodiac was too expensive for what was offered.  Overall I would recommend."
Location is awesome  The room was nicely made with rose pebbles  they greeted well  staff is really friendly n they take extra efforts to make you comfortable Food is awesome  They really take hospitality seriously  Looking forward to stay again 
"It was a wonderful experience.  We stayed in front of a beautiful monument and had a marvellous view on the sea. We recommend this hotel : it's a beautiful place to stay and start a vacacion or business trip ! The City trip, recommended by your people was very interesting.  We visited the Gandhi house, a temple, a laundry, the watersystem in a park, and a slum."
"My wife had booked it for my bday surprise...hotel is no doubt one of the best property in India. We had been promised up gradation of the room, which dint happen. Also, we found that services were quite slow and there is very little room for flexibility from the waiters or attendants. Overall, it was much hyped, but an average stay."
We found excellent accommodations in the historic wing.  The 1 1/2 hour guided tour of the hotel was facsinating and worthwhile.  The conciege organized a dawn cycling tour of the city for us which was very interesting and exciting.  The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is first rate in every way and we look forward to staying there again as soon as possible.
"I arrived after a long drive from Pune. The welcome at the reception was very nice. I was shown my room in the Tower with a beautiful view on the Gate of India. Finally time to relax! .. unfortunately some construction work was done and the noise did not quite give me the relaxed feeling I longed for.  I decided not to unpack and went to the reception to kindly ask for other possibilities for me to stay. The reception kindly looked into the possibilities and asked to come back in a few minutes. When I came back, still somewhat tired and with a need to fresh up, Mr. Jagat Yajnik was there to greet me. From that moment on I experienced how royalty must feel treated on a daily basis. He first guided me to the Harbour Bar where I could sit down with a cool refreshment while he took"
"The Taj Palace is a centrally located and an unbelievably enjoyable experience. It introduced us to new levels of hotel luxury. The breakfasts were elegant and tasty, tea time was professional, happy hour had a wide selection of drinks, and the after dinner aperitifs was an elegant finish to a busy day."
I had visited this great Hotel when i was in mumbai. The ambience of this hotel both exxterior & interior is awesome. I had been to Shamnia restaurant for sunday brunch. The variety of food was huge where each dish tasted great. the service was also good. the sunday brunch for non alcholics comes around 3300 per head but its really worth. Must visit for foodies.
"From location, to service to comfort, this hotel has it all.   Their room service is impeccable and the staff are very helpful. Must check-in if you plan to trip to Mumbai.   Experience Mumbai with the Taj!"
"The Club suite was an excellent choice on our part; we were thoroughly pampered and looked after,it fully met our expectations. There was a slight issue ...no breakfast on our final day due to a very early departure flight... which was not accommodated for. But we would definitely go back again and would recommend this hotel, staff friendly and helpful, hotel excellent ."
"What an incredible place to stay.  The attention to detail is fantastic.  The location is superb.  The staff are incredibly attentive.  I would go back tonight if I could, in fact I would probably live there."
"We had a wonderful experience at the Taj. The staff seemed very fond of their place of work which is truly a museum. The hotel is very well taken care of. By the far, one of the best experiences we had in India."
"The hotel is very well located for a stay in Mumbai. You can easily reach some of the interesting spots. The Taj offers good facilities for a rest. It`s like a oasis in the lively Mumbai. Special thanks to the teams from reception, housekeeping and restaurant (breakfast)."
Excellent hotel and highly recommended especially the Palace Wing. Ate at two of the restaurants and food was excellent and not overly expensive. The paintings and art work in the corridors are outstanding.
"I generally prefer staying at the Taj Hotels because of the impeccable service. The staff is always courteous and ready to help.  However, the breakfast at Shamiana has not been up to the mark in this hotel. There are delays in service and the quality was also not very good."
One of the best experience we had in this Taj Palce Hotel. We were upgraded to Suite and serivce we got was out of this world. Staff were just brilliant. Leopold is round the corner. Would recomand anyone for once in a lifetime.
"My husband and I stayed in the Taj Mahal for a long weekend and were blown away by the pure luxury of the hotel. It was so nice to wander the busy streets and return to relax by the pool, we stayed in a club room and had breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktails included in the price, this was very worthwhile. As it was a weekend it was busy in the main hotel reception and there were always lots of people having their photo's taken. The restaurants are quite expensive though probably as you would expect, so we only visited one as preferred visiting the local cafe's to eat (Leopolds is amazing) all in all a wonderful experience. The staff really go the extra mile here."
"a beautiful hotel and an amazingly courteous and attentive staff. Even the maid service checked on us often to ensure a perfect stay. After working through a chaotic Mumbai, waking into the hotel was an incredible relief that balanced out city life and luxury living."
Taj Palace offers the most luxurious and indulgent stay in Mumbai for both business and leisure purpose with helpful staff and excellent service. It stays true to its lofty name and reputation and i will love visiting and staying there always.
"I have been visiting India frequently and have been staying at many hotels, primarily from the Taj group.  All beautiful settings and all great service. But this time it was exceptional.  All round, food, room, staff, the gym. Very quiet room and exceptionally clean and well maintained. And you can't bit the location. Great experience."
"last month I took my family for holiday to taj Mumbai and there I could understand that why the property has name TAJ. Taj symbolises the unique wonder in d world and so is the Taj Mahal palace, Mumbai. The front office people upgraded our dream desire of staying in palace with just one request.  The classic interiors with ultra modern facilities is d class of this property. I could see many old staff there which we do not get to see in five stars now a days, this clearly shows that taj cares for its staff too so the staff reciprocate to the guests. The baby sitting service for my son was excellent and the concierge service helped us to get d best disc in d city. Also he managed our entry without cover charges. It was a life time experience. Wow taj!"
"Impression Overall. Not only the historical building, the art you will find at all the places in the Hotel and rooms, the location of the hotel itself, so close to the best Shops in the City makes the stay so wonderful. The Service with so well educated engaged people, the excellent different restaurants are completing the stay. A wonderful experience which I want not miss"
Had a great stay here. The staff were very professional and also very nice. The food was some of the best you can get. Breakfast buffet was really super. The room with a sea view had everything you need. The pool area was very good and the pool was nice and deep. Will stay here again. Top Taj hotel
"I recently stayed at Taj Mahal Palace hotel Mumbai and all i can say is wow. I have traveled quite a lot  but never experienced service as good as this. Everyone always happy to help with a smile on their face. I had informed them it was my mums birthday and balloons and roses were delivered which was very lovely. Our dessert arrived late b by only a few minutes and we were sent complimentary fruit on top as a sorry. The breakfast was yummy and the waiters were so helpful and no request to big. The tour is great at 5pm every day , get a real insight into the hotel. Thanks Taj for a great experience."
"Always stay here on my trips to India. And I have never been disappointed. For the best middle eastern food outside The Middle East, try what Chef Simon cooks at The Souk. His shwarma is delicious and ask any of the waiters for a good wine. These guys know what they are doing."
The employees were all very helpful and pleasant and the hotel itself is beautiful. It is a work of art inside and out. I would definitely recommend this. As a solo female travelor I felt very secure and cared for. The service was outstanding.
Couldn't praise highly enough the staff and standards at the hotel. They even kept the bar open so the team of thirsty cricket supporters could drown sorrows after match one and then celebrate success after match 2. great food 24 hours a day and superb access to the sights of South Mumbai. Bedrooms were excellent !!!
the hotel exceeded my expectations.  we were upgraded to a palace room having booked a deal online for a tower room.  I'd seen a TV documentary on the BBC about the hotel so was expecting somewhere special but it is more beautiful than it looked in the series.  More importantly we were made to feel so welcome by each and every member of staff all of whom seemed genuinely proud of their hotel.  the garden and pool area are a delight and a real oasis in the madness that is the city beyond the walls.  would definitely stay here again should I find myself in Mumbai.
"What a place. I knew it would be good, but I was enthralled by it. The building is stunning. The staff are amazing, so helpful and so attentive. The room could not be more be more comfortable. You have to have a cocktail in the bar. And take a tour do the city in a hotel car. A great way to explore the first time in Mumbai. Can't wait to return. The concierge was so helpful when I needed to make arrangements. And the staff could not do more. Nothing was too much trouble."
"Been to a few hotels but the experience at the Taj was Exclusive, Classic, Vintage and heart felt. The staff could not do enough, they respected your space and you are made you FEEL welcome to their home. There are many hotels around the world that look modern and have all the bling but for me nothing comes close so far to the Taj. Definate thumbs up and would love to come back"
Had an amazing experience. Got a free upgrade to the Palace. The stay was amazing & made me feel like a celebrity. Staff is very courteous & helpful all the time. Would however want better dinning options. I had given my car for valet for 2 days. Someone should have at least washed the car
"Our family of four (including 2 small children) stayed at the Taj Palace this past weekend and had one of the most memorable and enjoyable stays we’ve had in a long time.  Deputy Manager, Isha Mehta and her wonderful team went out of their way to accommodate our needs and requests and ensured that we were well treated and cared for during our entire stay.  Exemplary guest services by her staff in the Sea Lounge and Palace Lounge during Breakfast, High Tea, Cocktail hours, and Chocolate/Cognac sessions were of noteworthy mention.  Ms. Mehta is definitely a role model of what a good manager should be as she treated all her guests with a cordial smile and the utmost consideration and respect.  Although we do not remember all the names of the wonderful staff that we had the"
I accompanied my husband on a Business trip to India and we decided to stay a couple of extra days in Mumbai in order to stay at the Taj.  Due to the extra days where we had to pay for accommodation we were not able to finance a stay in the Palace itself so opted for one of the better Sea View Tower rooms. We had previously arranged through the Concierge for a car to pick us up from the airport which was waiting for us on arrival. We were greeted like VIP's on arrival and led to the Lobby area in the Palace......joy of joy they had upgraded us to a sea view room in the Palace. The room was large and had a delightful seating area in the alcove overlooking the sea with a wonderful view of The Gateway of India. The room contained everything needed for an away from home stay. The
Staying at the Taj Palace was the best hotel experience ever!  The staff anticipated my every need without my saying anything.  I hope to return and recommend you consider treating yourself to the experience of a lifetime.  Mumbai was also a wonderful place to spend a week.
"A wonderful and peaceful experience away from the maddening crowds. The staff are amazing. The food was excellent. The service was superb. After 18 busy days traveling in India, the Taj was an oasis of luxury."
"Actually Taj Mahal palace 2 km from Mumbai city center and 32 km from Chattrapati Shivaji International Airport, there also availble free parking. Especially about innerside of Taj Hotel, there is lot of arrengment from Servicing to sleeping. Hearty meals,private balcony, elegant rooms are tastefully furnished with fine linen and classic wood furnishings. They offer the comfort of a flat-screen TV, sofa and luxurious bathrooms that feature a bathtub.This iconic 5-star hotel features a landscaped pool, fitness facilities and a first-rate spa. The hotel provides 11 dining options. Free WiFi is available throughout the property. This like a heaven during stay time."
"Come in with very high expectations, and out with a sigh of  relief.     Very luxurious place to the point of ostentation. GREAT laundry service, fair food, superb pool and poolside, some very nice staff and nice artefacts in the hotel...  But. Often even when you don't need it two ""helpers"" latch onto you, and the'yre not shy about showing that you didn't tip enough.  When you need it it's more of a problem (no help to find a place charge my phone in the lobby). A terrible smell of ... let's say ""must"" (to be nice) in the whole place, in the lobby adn public areas they cover it with artificial perfume that gives a headache. Also in the lobby constructions going on, no regard for the guests trying to have a conversation. First room had a terrible A/C smell (like last years'"
"The beauty of the Hotel was matched with an excellent service.  The huge pool, moreover, was a unique oasis in the middle of a hot and noisy city.  We used it every day extensively, to swim, to rest and to have a drink."
"Though we thoroughly enjoyed our stay , there was some lacuna considering the fact that we had booked the high value Taj Club Room for two nights.  The Taj Club Suite was pretty standard compared to other 5 stars .They weren't any bigger in size and no special room amenities.  The room didn't have a couch .Just had a single seater sofa.Couches are common even in other 5 star basic rooms.  There was no response on the Palace Room service and the duty manager phone extensions most of the times during evenings and nights.We eventually had to call the operator extension for stuff.  We weren't garlanded or welcomed in a special way unlike the other guests especially foreigners.  Snacks at Hi-Tea and Cocktail hours were bland and nothing special was offered.Even non 5 star hotels and"
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is a cool, fragrant oasis of calm in the midst of a steamy, bustling Mumbai. It is hard not to fall in love with this hotel and its beautiful fresh flowers, large lobbies, pristine rooms and friendly staff. Lovely pool and outdoor seating. Breakfast is great however the restaurants in the hotel feel a bit sterile at times. Perfect base for work or holidaying in Mumbai."
"Extremely courteous staff, excellent service standard, highly recommended to all.   At the Taj, you are not a number you are actually an individual, and for me that is an extremely important quality that the TAJ team has ."
"Lovely location, great for site seeing. The hotel itself has had some major refurbishment with a huge reception area that wouldn't look out of place in Vegas. Top named boutiques and a wonderful selection of restaurants, all first class. Also within this hotel is an amazing collection of historical pieces, beautifully appointed rooms and excellent staff and facilities."
"The hotel has 2 sections: the old and traditional section - the most prestigious and elegant -, and the modern section. We stayed in the modern section for 3 nights.  Location - Excellent; facing the harbor. Beautiful view. Service - Excellent, discreet, friendly, available, efficient. Room - Spacious, comfortable, clean, with a nice view. Hotel design - I like the old section's charm, as well as the swimming pool in the back of the hotel. Price - Our private guide obtain us to stay for a heavy discounted price (about 50%!)."
This was my first time in Mumbai and as a solo female traveller I cannot rate the hotel highly enough.  Everybody made me feel comfortable and at ease.  It is an iconic hotel.  If I every have the opportunity to return I would never stay anywhere else.
"We stayed in the old part (Heritage Wing) and our room on the 2nd floor had a marvellous view of the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea. The staff were very attentive and welcoming, and the food good. For breakfast we had a choice of using the Sea Lounge or outside on the terrace by the swimming pool. The water in the swimming pool was, if anything, too hot but the setting was lovely. We were given a tour of the hotel with it's history the day of arrival. One tiny thing that would have been appreciated would have been a mirror near the hair dryer plug. I'm sure if I'd have asked one would have been brought to me, but I didn't ask. One night we were given another room to sleep in as a wedding in the ballroom beneath us was likely to be noisy. This was a nice touch. This is"
"Recently my wife and I booked a weekend break at the Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai and there really are no words to describe how enjoyable our stay was.  The hotel has a charm of it's own but the staff were so attentive and courteous, that they made our stay very special. From the staff at the front desk, to the restaurants and the spa, all the staff makes you feel like you are their most important guest. We have stayed at many Taj hotels and their perfection to the smallest details and the attitude of the staff has always been excellent but we found the Taj Mahal Hotel just that little bit more special. The hotel itself is beautiful and they have a tour of the hotel in the evening explaining its history, which we found very interesting. We had a great weekend and recommend everyone"
"The hotel accommodation and service was excellent, I would recommend the experience to anyone travelling to Mumbai for business or leisure. Just the architecture and history of the people visiting the hotel is worth the room rate."
"The Staff at the Taj are exceptional.  We stayed at the Taj for 5 nights while in town for an Indian wedding.  We stayed in the tower suite.  The rooms are very old, is the only downside.  They need to be updated.   The grounds are beautiful, the pool area is lovely and the spa and gym are exceptional.  The daily breakfast was also very nice.  Great location.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Mumbai."
Upon our arrival to the departure .....service was WOW . Service is the Taj group mantra....accommodated my family in every way possible...thank you. Breakfast was yummy....love the dragon fruit....chocolate and cognac tasting wad a first for me and hubby ....what an experience.my second stay at Taj and it gets better  The tour is a must for every guest very informative.When you walk into the Taj from a long day of sightseeing or shoppin......that fragrance just relaxes you...pity I didn't get to enquire about it...definite will on my next stay........a big thank you to the entire staff for making our stay a memorable one .......
"We spent a nice weekend @Taj Mahal Palace. Very impressive architecture but atmoshere still comfortable and private. Staff very engaged and with good English language skills, some seem to read wish of customer from the lips. Room very nice and as one could expect clean and nicely prepared. We had the club package adding up to higher price, but the entry to palace lounge with free beverages and snacks is worth it! We got pickup in a BMW from airport and used late checkou option as well. SPA service not cheap but also excellent. One of my best hotel stays so far! Easily comparable/better than western hotels."
"Visited Taj for my long weekend break! My wife was a bit apprehensive of paying a high price but sometimes you want your kids to see places which have a Iconic place in HISTORY. And after the stay we are so sure we made the right decision.. Right from check-in to the complimentary upgrade and a bouquet of flowers in the evening.. everything was so charming and pleasant. The sea-facing room presented breaktaking views of the Gateway and the vast sea..  Not to be missed - HERITAGE tour of the property at 5:00pm which actually makes you aware of the historical importance of this property.. Stay in TAJ PALACE should be a MUST-DO bucket list item.. you won't regret!  Location is awesome - close to Leoport cafe, Bade miya, Necklace road and fashion street.. and cabs were so friendly.."
"Did not stay here be cause we were on a cruise but cooled off after visiting the Gateway to India with many locals.  A cool respite.  Others had a wonderful lunch here.  We went shopping on Causeway something two blocks behind it for trinkets, scarves and knock off watches.  Fun but got very hot! shopping.  The whole area reflects former glory days."
The most beautiful experience one is likely to have.   From the moment you enter the hotel you are transported into a magical place in time.  The staff and the offering are top class. There is nothing more that we could have expected from our stay.
Just like the name suggest it is a huge palace and you are the king of your room for the day. I took the suite which was amazing... The ambience the decor all was just out of the world.  Their service is quite nice and the food very tasty. Will definitely wanna stay here again.
"The Taj Palace Mumbai is without doubt a unique experience and worth the money and the reputation or excellence.The moment you enter the hotel, you are greeted by the scent of flowers and a warm welcome from all staff that you encounter. Service is prompt and staff go that extra mile to meet requests for help and reduce stress. The rooms are very comfortable.Ours overlooking the Gateway of India had a comprehensive range of fittings that worked and a cleaning service several times a day. The rooms are not large but ample. The breakfast selection should satisfy any taste and the service again was excellent. We tried the Masala Kraft restaurant and the Harbour View Bar, both a great experience and we could not fault them.  The location of course is also ideal. The only downside"
Hotel is not among the best as per my experience. Food in the hotel is not that good comparing the price we pay. Service for in house guest was not as expected. Rest all was  as per the standard. But the location of the hotel was the best part since being located is front of the gateway of india
"Right from check in to check out I found everything faultless.The service was the best and the staff helpful and,friendly and the food delicious.Pool area best ever for being spoiled by the ever attentive staff.Not as expensive as you would expect.JUST GO THERE.great location for Restaurants sightseeing and markets just outside the hotel."
"Excellent hotel, very well located; with huge, clean and confortable rooms; very good service, pleasant staff, five different restaurants, outstanding breakfast. We highly recommend this hotel to enjoy Mumbai and India."
"An adventure and a sight to behold, the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is a must stay experience, superior service, staff, experience I'll say it again it was so good. An adventure and a sight to behold, the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is a must stay experience, superior service, staff, experience"
"We had a memorable one day stay at the Taj. Each and every member of the staff was extremely polite and genuinely helpful.  At the night of our arrival, we were graciously welcomed, made comfortable in the lounge while our luggage was being brought in, given a good overview of facilities available to us, and I loved the garland and tika given to us by your staff member. The refreshing complimentary tea delivered to the room was just what we needed after a tiring 20 hour travel. The room and bathroom were impeccably clean.It was almost 12:30 am when we got to try the restaurant at your hotel. The chicken biryani I ordered was extraordinary ( and I have had chicken biryani at numerous world-class restaurants !).  We stopped by the business center as we needed assistance with the"
"The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai overlooking the gateway of India is simply a breathtaking place to stay with some of the best service I have experienced anywhere.  For me in any hotel the staff are the key and the Taj has most certainly bench-marked this as the quality of the training is clear to see. I arrived after a long day travelling and late in the evening. The assistant who showed me to my room could clearly see this and offered me a cappuccino and snacks in my room. This small gesture made me feel relaxed and appreciate this historic hotel from day 1. Plus Location, location, location, unbeatable!"
"This opulent hotel is right next to the Gateway to India, one of the most famous landmarks in India, it was the 'last stance' of the remaining terrorists in the attacks in 2008. We had high tea there, it feels very safe with lots of security, and the service was second to none. The building is magnificent, one of the most beautiful hotels I've seen in the world, well worth a look. "
"Service is unparalleled, building and grounds are amazing, and rooms are perfect. I was lucky enough to be upgraded to the historic original building. I love exploring new cities, but this time the pool at the Taj won out."
"I  enjoyed my time at Taj Hotel, greeting me was a joy; The food at the Japaneses was excellent.. The view from my window was nice..   Breakfast was healthy and verity of food..   Thank you...  I will be Back Dr. Hani Fetyani"
"Everything about the Taj Mahal Palace is outstanding.  However, the attentiveness, unfailing courtesy and professionalism of all the members of staff is something that makes the whole experience so fabulous.  If your budget will stretch to it, stay in a Palace room."
"We got an upgrade to a room with sea view, facing the gateway of india.  The pool area is amazing and the high tea / buffet excellent. Of course the spa treatments are more expenssiv, but the staff was very friendly.  -- For the wifi we paid extra. Inadmissible for a 5* hotel!"
The location of the Hotel is one of the finest in the World and it offers a beautiful view from every room and offers an extremely well laid out rooms and the corridors .  The Hotel offers a wide variety of cuisine each one excelling over the other .Services offered are World class .
"I had enough loyalty points to spoil myself and stop here. I stop at other Taj brands when travelling in India. I booked 2 nights after a weeks work.  from arrival to departure they treat you like they said on the UK tv program ""like a god""  I had a perfect view of the bay and gateway, the room was totally functional, clean and well maintained. but the most impressive thing is the service. I am in the industrial service trade and I have taken photos to demonstrate good service to my staff. I had to thank one of the housekeeping staff for something he did and he was actually embarrassed at my thanks, he saw it as his service.  walking through the corridors all staff greeted you with warmth, it was genuine warmth and concern this on top of such an impressive building and location"
 Our experience with our teenage daughters was wonderful and I've now stayed in nearly all the Tajs in India and I can't fault them. This place is huge yet they maintain the personal service. The location is the best place in town beside the freedom gate with everything that's worth seeing on your doorstep.  It's weird to say but we felt we were on the French rivière watching the boats bob up and down on the glistening water. The rooms were a wee bit small. The breakfast was superb but don't eat in the overcrowded coffee shop area languor in the beauty of their gardens. Enjoy their marble pool which is huge but they suffer from a lack of sunbeds. We were given a towel and told to lie on the grass. Weird for one of the best hotels in India!  People-watching is fantastic and they
"This hotel provides a once in a life time experience, the staff is so incredibly attentive & kind. The service is outstanding, the restaurants all unique and amazing. When going to the pool garden, you enter a peaceful oasis right in the heart of the busy buzzing city. Staying at the palace itself is like a journey back to another century... highly recommend as a must visit property."
"Superb old, historical, hotel in an excellent position overlooking the Arabian Sea & the Gateway of India monument. The service is impeccable & the restaurants are excellent. This must rank amongst one of the best hotels in the world."
The service is unquestionable if you are lucky enough to stay in the palace it makes you feel like royalty. After a long day sight seeing came back to our rooms with oil and rose petals in a beautiful dish to soak our feet.
"We were there for a lunch visit and a look round  as we were on a cruise. It is a lovely place and the lunch was not a typical ""tour"" lunch but a beautifully  presented buffet.  The choice was amazing and the desserts were to die for !!!  The staff were also very attentive and courteous and our time at the hotel was very relaxing.   There is a fabulous pool area and a nice bar where  you can get something to eat also. There is also no sound of the city in this tranquil spot.   I will definitely return and stay here some day!!"
"It is a great place to stay. A home away from home. Every thing be it check in or check out formalities, quality of food and service at the restaurant and the comfort of stay in the room are all excellent. The staff treat you with at most care and it is a pleasure."
"It was disappointing to witness that guests weren't allowed to visit me. While I visit Bombay once every month, this was the first time I stayed at your hotel and rest assured, I shall not repeat the mistake.    Disappointing to witness a premium property having such a policy. It was a humiliating experience for myself and my guests."
This hotel offers excellent quality and service should be classed as 6* Staff very attentive but not intrusive.  The Concierge were helpful both before and during our stay. It is not cheap but it is a exceptional experience and everything you ask for is provided.
Great Hotel  serving you as Mehraja  pleasant stay  the atmosphere  the resturant  the service  every thimg was excellant  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you thank you  thank you      feel like home
It is a great place with great dinning experience. The staff is super friendly and attend to you very quickly. We went for some weekend gateway as well as attending some business that we have as a couple and all services were great and helped us to have a very comfortable stay.
"This hotel typifies service & old world charm . I have stayed around the world in many hotels. This is among the best . The rooms the service , some of the nest food you can find anywhere. This hotel oozes class in every aspect & every wall is seeped with history"
"Always love a stay at The Taj - the team are fantastic and the facilities are of the great standard, a great mix of traditional Indian hospitality and contemporary service.  The Palace rooms are the best place to be and breakfast at the Sea Lounge."
"Best Hotel we have ever been. We got an upgrade to a very, very nice and big Suite all in silver (Maharani style). Very nice bathroom with all accomodities. We asked for a meal, not so spicy, and got a very good dinner. Further we have taken the Hotel car with driver for a very good price and have seen Jaipur, Fort Amber, aso. All was excellent."
"wonderful experience from the time you enter hotel until departure... you need to do the tour of the hotel to understand and appreciate the beauty and history of hotel... make time to enjoy the breakfast spread at least eat once in any of there restaurant, take time to enjoy the hotel, it is as a holiday on its own with out leaving the hotel.Try to have breakfast at the poolside as well.Enjoy interaction with the staff as it is so wonderfull to listen to some of there stories"
"At least twice per annum we stay at the Taj Maha, Mumbail for several days. It is our favourite hotel in all our world travels, with truly excellent service and resident attention. The combination of retained old colonial atmosphere with modern amenities is magnificent. Thank you and we look forward to our next visit in September"
"Staying at the Taj Mahal Palace is always a very positive experience. Excellent service, friendly and professional staff, all the services you need, a selection of very good restaurants and beautiful rooms. We travel a lot, but the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is definitely one of the best hotels in the world! G & M"
"Having stayed at the Taj quite a few times over the years it is always gratifying to find things as good as ever, we recently spent a week in the Palace wing. That this is a beautiful hotel is not in doubt, the decoration and attention to detail is as good as it has always been. What sets the Taj apart from other similar hotels around the world are the staff. Clearly encouraged by management to engage with guests its is always a welcome part of visits to any Taj property to be able to have proper conversations if you want them, if you don't thats fine too.    We tend to eat evening meals outside so really only enjoy breakfast at the hotel. This is generally excellent, the mixed buffet offerings have daily changes as well as the regular staples and we found the quality and"
"The Taj property is indeed exceptional and the service was very warm. The team was informed of my wife's bday and they made sure they made it special for her in every way. Every restaurant we ate in, she was wished and a cake was instantly brought to cut. The palace lounge took special care of decorating a table for her. Excellent experience overall"
The only bad experience was at the time of Check in at the hotel. The front staff should always have smile face and should give a warm welcome to the guest. Rest part of the stay was good. The hotel is being maintained very nicely and having good antique pieces in the lobby
"Wow what can you say about this hotel. It is truly out of this world. This has to be on your bucket list of places to stay. The service is second to none, all of the staff are attentive and happy to help. It was fascinating to be in a hotel of such history and grandeur. The hotel tour is a must to give you an insight then enjoy."
"This hotel is truly one of the finer traditional style hotels in the world, with old style service and a magnificient Palace Wing. The rooms are literally wall to wall marble and the fittings and amenities would take pride of place anywhere...traditional or modern. Food options are excellent and the location across the road from the Gateway to India is fantastic. In some ways, the guest photos on the way to the Palace wing provide the final recommendations. Add it to your bucket list!"
"We had a wonderful 2 nights in the hotel at the end of a 2 week tour around India. Mumbai is a world apart from Delhi, Agra etc - much more modern and a joy to visit. We especially welcomed the Starbucks which adjoins the hotel. We stayed in the Palace wing which is definitely the way to go. Food was great but very expensive in the hotel restaurants. Swimming pool was nice and wonderful view over the gate of india from our room."
The service and overall experience was the best we have ever had. On arrival we were upgraded to the Taj Club and Taj Palace suite.  The staff were ever so friendly and looked after us throughout our stay.  The pool facility was excellent with clean towels and fresh cool water in plentiful supply. Thank you.
"Of all the major and minor world cities we have traveled to, this is the best hotel we have ever stayed at. Just marvelous. Everything was just perfection. Staff so pleasant, and the service so superb."
This is a beautiful hotel in Mumbai India. I would recommend the Taj Palace Hotel to and couple or business trip. The food was very good an the traditional hotel room are large and beautiful. It has a great pool area.
"This was my firs time but will definitely visit again... It was a really amazing experience staying at Taj. Staying at the Taj was an exciting one of experience, that pleasantly met all expectations. It is not a matter of just staying somewhere with the bells and whistles, but instead somewhere with a great history and heritage. Most impressively an experience that will not be forgotten."
"This is one of the Grand Old Dame hotels of the world. Not only is this a beautiful hotel, but the staff and service are exceptional. We loved our time here and will definitely be staying here again if we are in Bombay."
India is a vast country with many sub cultures... either at the beginning of your trip or last memory of india before you say goodbye.. Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai is an absolute must stay/ see experience
"Fabulous hotel, excellent staff and all in all a super enjoyable experience. We appreciated the upgrade and made the most of the beautiful hotel, pool, spa and restaurants. Best Japanese food had to date. Thank you"
"Having traveled to India over a period of 15 years on business and pleasure, has the Taj Palace become our last stop home on every trip....from the hotel car at the airport to the check in and the breakfast buffet and not forgetting.....the best beds in the world!"
"Taj hospitality rocks....  staying at the palace wing is a an experience in itself. Old world charm, hospitality is super, got an upgrade for the room even without asking & dinner at Masala Kraft was too too good..."
"I had stayed in this hotel from 10 to 12 April. Overall experience was good but definitely not excellent . The reasons I had written to Taj as Taj gold member. Better I will ask for few details before reservation if I am staying at Taj property next time,"
I have been fortunate enough to have travelled the world and stayed at some great hotels but the Taj (Mumbai) must be the best for ambience and service. Definately recommend one eats at the Zodiac Grill - truely Fine Dining !!!!
"Everything about the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel exceeded expectations. The room was wonderful, the hotel itself is a piece of art. The facilities are of a very high standard and the service is outstanding. I would have no hesitation in staying here again or recommending to others, as long as the budget will stretch enough."
"Unparalleled service and attention to detail in an understated way, luxury in the truest sense. Old world charm. I got terrible food poisoning from a restaurant somewhere in the city and the hotel took such good care of me. A very special hotel."
Stayed there for two days with my daughter.  Was impressed by the reception hall and the staff that greeted us with the Indian ritual and custom before taking us to the room.  The room look very majestic and the ambience very much like a palace.  A very nice place to stay while visiting Mumbai
"What more can we say of this Ícon of Mumbai? Such a wonderful place, full of history, with an excellent location, where staff with their unbeatable kindness, smile at any question and go behind our expectations to make sure nothing was, is or will be missed. The perfect place to start and again chosen to end (with a longer stay) my first visit to impressive India. Never had I seen such diversity of cultures and religions cohexisting in a frenetic but peaceful harmony. A lesson to the world.!"
Though its is a dream come true to  spend a night in this fancy hotel but not if you are in one of the old wing rooms. i feel some of the Vinanta properties have better rooms then there small size deluxe rooms. otherwise the hotel is quite impressive and MASSIVE. the banquet space is quite classy as well.  if you are willing to shell out more bucks then go for any old wing rooms.! i shall write another review to let you know if the property is haunted on not :-P
"We stayed there 4 days before the start of our cruise from Mumbai to Athens with Seabourn and are very impressed. The hotel has such a grandeur and atmosphere and the entrance hall alone is an experience in itself. There are three very good restaurants (Indian, Chinese and Japanese) and we ate in all three of them and where never disappointed with the quality and taste of the food. However; and this may sound odd; we most enjoyed the breakfast with all the Indian specialties."
"Your first stay in the Taj will obviously be coloured by what you had already heard about this legendary hotel. What you will find, however, is that this is one place where you feel at home instantly. There is this grand building, great facilities, shiny corridors, but it is the service which reminds you of the old days you spent in a joint family. So you may come here for business, but you will stay on for pleasure!"
"This was my first stay at this hotel. It's a splendid hotel, it has good facilities,  good restaurants ( the one that serves breakfast is very good, nice food and pleasent atmosphere  ).  Check-in and check-out was the most agreeable and  .  I love the lobby lounge of this hotel, it's spaciuos and elegant in accordance with the  atmosphere transmited by the staff . Flowers arrengement evrywhere :what a dream! Thanks for all!"
"Came here for high tea and buffet at 4pm on a Saturday.  Welcoming staff, excellent service and really great selection of food.  Ask for a window seat to sit overlooking the gate and sea view.  Great selection of tea, and really nice Indian selection too.  I would recommend for anyone really - it's actually so cheap! The price was £15 per person, which we were shocked at as expected it to be much higher.  A pleasant afternoon.  Would recommend walking around the hotel too as it is beautiful."
"A very grand hotel, every luxury, we stayed in the original hotel (not the new tower block) and everything is as you would expect for a five star hotel.  The hotel chauffeur met us at the airport and drove us to the hotel. Check in was in our room itself and then our floor butler served us tea in our room. All very civilised.  Room was very luxurious as was the bathroom service all round was as expected.  Please note that the tower block part of the hotel is covered in scaffolding and plastic sheeting on two sides – this is extremely ugly and at time very noisy. If you are relaxing by the pool, the tower block looms over and when they are drilling and banging you will not get a peaceful poolside rest. Also, there is no poolside drinks or food service in evidence. We were never"
"I would fly around the world JUST to stay at this hotel.  I loved everything about it.  It is gorgeous.  I was upgraded to a suite and it was large, elegant and clean.  The linens and the pillows were heavenly.  I stayed in the Palace wing and paid the extra for Club level.  It was well worth it.  I enjoyed drinks and heavy hors d'oeuvres in the evening and a huge buffet breakfast in the morning.  The location is perfect.  And, the staff couldn't do enough for me.  I highly recommend it."
"Wonderful hotel, centrally located in Mumbai.  Attentive, capable staff.  Lovely mix of old and new.  Food excellent; pool lovely.  Room very comfortable.  Have stayed here several times and always enjoyable.  Service exceptional.  Highly recommended."
"I have had the pleasure of staying at the Palace over many years and not once have I ever left feeling standards have slipped or in need of improvement. The level of service is second to none, the staff are so well tuned into their customers requirements without coming across as overbearing or false. The Club rooms are so comfortable with beds and pillows that are to die for. Eating in any of the restaurants is a delightful experience, food and service is second to none."
"Honestly there is very very little to fault. The building is historical and beautiful, the location was great for us as we were in Mumbai for leisure ( if you are on business you could find it a little far). The service overall is impeccable, really nothing to fault there.  The room and marble bathroom was tastefully done. ( we stayed in the Palace not the Tower) The breakfast room has a lovely view on the sea and the ""Gateway to India monument"". The Breakfast itself and the service was good ( read not outstanding ) Wasabi by Morimoto, the japanese restaurant on the first floor is incredible. If you like Japanese don't miss it.  ... and we were upgraded when we arrived, which was nice!   For the price you are paying and the experience you are getting, it's a bargain, seriously."
"The service staff were friendly, attentive and went the extra miles to ensure I have a good stay in the hotel. Situated in Colaba, it is easily accessible to places such as Gateway of India and cafes.Good Restaurants in Colaba. Lastly, if you do not want to venture to combat with the traffic, the crowd or the heat, there are many activities and restaurants within the hotels to keep your time well- spent. I like the Restaurant, on the Top , forgot the Name but for India overpriced , international priced. But I loved the food. You can take the ship to elephant Island , just across the Road , at the Gate of India. Its a nice trip. Close to Victoria station, where you get trains in almost all direction, special the 10 pm night train to Goa.So, the location is at best, if you need to"
Stayed at the Taj for one night and day for my birthday before flying home after 3 weeks in India. We were greeted with the best service and friendliness by all the staff - the hotel is beautiful and a bit of a treasure and everyone who works there seems to be take great pride in it. I love that hotel!
"This grand old hotel is very special and full of history.  The service is amongst the very best I've experienced in the world, amazing staff who literally cannot do enough for you.  Amazing pool and outside spaces, the common public areas are well maintained and the several restaurants have fantastic food albeit a little overpriced for what you get even for a 5 star hotel in Asia.  The rooms whilst clean are in desperate need of a makeover, this is an old colonial style hotel not a new modern one and the rooms reflect this which is great, and why many people including ourselves stayed there but nevertheless the rooms felt a bit run down and had a rather unpleasant musky odour upon arrival which never really went away.  The hotel has all of the amenities and opulent touches you'd"
"What can i say. It was flawless!  We arrived very early on the 7th March, having just arrived in Mumbai on the overnight train from Jaipur. It was 8am, and I had seriously injured my ankle and couldn't walk on it (prior to boarding the train in Jaipur!).  As soon as we arrived, we were checked in immediately and taken to a gorgeous palace room overlooking the pool. The room was wonderful but what was more wonderful were the staff and management. The duty manager, who's name I regrettably cannot remember, was fantastic in arranging a doctor to speak to me, and then also transport and a chaperone to take me to the hospital to get an X-ray. She looked after me and my wife very well and i was back in the hotel and taken care of a couple of hours later. Had it not been for the staff"
We stayed for one night with my husband and I really regret that we didn't have any more nights in Bombay to stay there and enjoy the beautiful hotel and it's ammenities. The views are gorgeous and breakfast buffet and location are amazing! I would love to go back!
"So looking back on a food tour around Northern India which was the best hotel out of the six I stayed in ? The Taj has to have been the most comfortable bed I slept in and the best service I received. There is a smiling polite 'good morning' at every turn and nothing is too much trouble. Things that could have been better; breakfast had the most gorgeous view but the choice was not the best of the trip. The pool is lovely but there are not enough beds which is mad considering how big their pool is. I would love to go back though, just to lie in one of those beds again."
"I booked a room at Taj Mahal online not knowing they have two buildings, one old(better one I guess) and one new(nothing special)......i got a room in the new building which was like any other 3 star or 4 star hotel...pool area is very good and the location of the hotel is probably the best in mumbai....but if u have work in bandra or juhu or mahim....its far from those places...and most important for me was free wifi...and to my surprise...free wifi means only selected internet..email and all...thats ridiculous... The Taj is regarded as one of the best hotels and to sum it up in one line.. I have stayed in better hotels...much better...."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a very famous hotel, marked as one of the best in Mumbai and if you make reservations there, expectations are high.  We had a room on the ""Delux"" Level with a nice view over the harbour. The room was not big and has seen better days. Frunishing was a bit outdated, the room was pretty cramped. A little less furiture would have been more. The room was carpeted wall to wall, not a good idea in India, where it is alway damp and the carpet looked that one did not want to walk on it really. Housekeeping was good, prompt and even though we arrive at midnight, readily available to meet our needs. Now that is five star service! As is the service throughout the hotel. Perfect staff everywhere, attentive, friendly and service-oriented.  Wireless is free (three"
"Asian hospitality, smiles and service is unmatchable and the Taj Mahal Palace epitomises that. Quick and smooth checkin by staff Priyanka, then a lady garlands and puts teeka in traditional style which will make you feel like a celebrity (see pic, posted with permission of lovely Radhika) very friendly staff.   Rooms are not exceptional but just good. Remember it's Mumbai where real estate prices compete with highest in the world, beds very soft and one wants to sleep more!  Great service and personal care in breakfast buffet. My request for small aloo parantha also got them bringing a baby aloo parantha. Spread is good. Baked yoghurt is actually the famous Misti Doi! Alphonso mangoes to figs to even Singapore Laksa in choices!  Short stay. Will return for more!"
"This is among the finest hotels in the world. I am frustrated by the negative reviews from those who took an online option to get the best price. You get what you pay for! Now pay a little extra and you will... I assure you... you will have an exceptional experience. Yes, club rooms are two, three, four times the special rates for the tower. My answer is simply - bucket list. Do it spend a little more and have the full service experience. This is one of the truly remarkable hotels in the world. Why would you try short cuts? Come on! Yes, it is a little fusy and difficult coming in and out. It's wasn't so long ago that this respendent hotel had its moment of misfortune. They care. They really care.   Please, please ignore the negative reviews. Enjoy the Taj experience!"
"We had a 2 day stopover on our way home from Goa & it was nothing short of amazing!!!  We booked a club room & upon arrival were upgraded to a club suite! We were met at the suite by our Butler, the children were showered with gifts & they had a cake & a bottle of wine for us! Amazing service!  Afternoon tea overlooking the Gateway to India is spectacular & it's worth staying club for that! Also the pre dinner drinks & handmade chocolates were also very special!   All the staff knew our names & got us tickets to see the IPL Mumbai Indians v Punjab, it was a fabulous evening out.  The concierge even went to the trouble of getting our children cricket jerseys to wear.  The pool is breathtaking in it beauty, well the whole hotel is actually and I feel we were treated like royalty"
"This was an fa boules hotel in heart of Mumbai no worlds to describe  from entrance till checkout everything is attended with smile  The way they welcome, they do the procedure of booking the cleaning process entire thing is more than good enough one can definitely use this property"
"Two short stays for the most fantastic service I have had on the Planet Every whim you may have is catered for, our rooms were just lovely. no dust, everything was SPOTLESS,  And the staff!!!! well to say polite is an understatement...  ""The only downside is that my wife and I WILL NOT STAY ANYWHERE ELSE"""
"Heard and read so much about it and so, came with som anticipation. Rooms are old and smelled musky, service is so-so only. During my first night, I left my room card in the room and needed a replacement one. So, I walked up to the receptionist to ask for one. She didn't greet me nor smiled at me but worse of all, she didn't even verify my identity before issuing me one. This is a serious concern of security!  If given a choice, I will never be back."
"My wife and I recently finished our honeymoon in India, and we really to stop off here. We were already upgraded to a sea view room on the top floor of the Tower, which was awesome. From the moment we checked-in and, it was mentioned then that we were honeymooners, we were, if it were even possible, spoiled even more. Flowers delivered to my wife, and a few other advantages added to our stay. We may not quite of received quite the same level of privileges of a few others in similar situations around the same time, but we were still flattered and extremely grateful. Great pool area, excellent gym and spa, amazing ambiance, decent breakfast, and comfortably the most amazing customer service anywhere in the world. The staff can even sense when you have an issue, mine was poor WiFi"
"Great for a business meeting. Watch the view outside - boats and yachts in the sea. The view of the magnificent Gateway. The grand Husain painting at the lobby. The grandeur of the hotel mesmerises you. The Chambers meeting rooms are fantastic. The ballroom is great for large receptions.   Staff are not the most trained and service levels a tad slower than  nearby Oberoi; but the building, it's historical nature, and the view more than make it up. "
"Food and drinks were overpriced, Had regular problems with the TV , for 2 days. Staff are friendly, Balcony was very tight,  Otherwise it was nice,l Lobby area was much better than the room, Apart from India gate not much to see, Bedrooms can do with a makeover due to the prices they charge, Breakfast area was always overcrowded, Takes around 1 hour from the airport, Please be careful of the police has they love your money."
"Calm, peaceful, noble, excellent! I'm missing sometimes in India a place where i can be free about environment, neighborhood and my European attitude for a inner freedom. This place has reminded me that India has a real hope to become a prominent country. ."
"We celebrated my dad's birthday with a style. So we booked into a family room, king bed and a loft bed for the kids! We love the room of course since we will be having our own bed to rest and enjoy through the night! Comfy bed, nice welcoming message on the TV. Feels like a VIP just checked in!..."
"I decided that in my time of life, luxury is what I need and require. Certainly no shortage here. From being picked up at the airport in my air conditioned car by my smartly dressed, uniformed driver to arriving in my 5th floor Club Room. Check in was smooth and quickly completed, leaving me time during the rest of the day to take in the lavish surroundings of the palace wing. Enjoying a drink in the Harbour Bar and planning my days by the pool and sight seeing. The staff were exceptional and within a few hours were calling me by name and smiling politely as they went about their business. Nothing was too much trouble and tours were quickly organised through the travel desk.  Go for a ""Club"" room, the drinks in the lounge, after dinner brandy and chocolates were a treat and made"
"I stayed there with my wife and 7 year old daughter (She just loved the Kids@Taj thing). Due to my flighted schedule I requested them an early check in which was considered without hesitation. The room was magnificent, architecture was worth applauding and the quality of the products used was incomparable.The experience was without parallel, the service was faultless and the breakfasts magnificent.   The views inside out are breathtaking but what touches your heart the most is the service. The staff never ceases to make you feel special. The pool, the spa, the restaurants and particularly the palace lounge keep creating awesome memories for you.   Just loved the stay and highly recommended; looking forward to come back soon."
"Stayed in the Suite room for a weekend break with my husband.  Makes you feel royal!  The size of the room and the bathroom is awesome!  We have been to Mumbai many times but the stay at the suite room in Taj this time made it extra special!  We loved the ambience of the hotel in general.  The buffet breakfast is a delectable spread.  I tried the spa- it is nothing great but OK.  It could be better in terms of ambience and size.  The Gateway of India in front of the Taj is a beautiful landmark, well lit at night to give the perfect look.  Just wish it was not cordoned off in front of the Taj.  All in all, a wonderful experience!"
"A Magnificent building, and an amazing staff  Step inside and its just like another world, the Opulence, Grandeur and Style is breath taking, We unfortunately could only stay for tea, but every moment was savoured The tea was served beautifully, and the staff were efficient, friendly and a pleasure to be served by They are a credit to the Taj Mahal Hotel  and when we are next in India, our next visit will be to stay at the hotel for a few days"
"To have a first hand experience of the fantastic Taj hospitality, this hotel is a must visit. The staff makes you feel at home all the time. Awesome restaurants in-house, fabulous poolside and the sheer opulence of the property will make you drool. Awesome!!"
This was the second visit to the hotel. We felt we were coming home. We were so excited and couldn't wait to arrive. We were greeted by our butler Grace and all the management and shown to our suite which was the suite we had previously stayed in. It was like coming home.   Grace proved to be the most outstanding butler we have ever had.  She thought about everything before we even knew we needed it.    The hotel is exceedingly well run. The conciege service is first class. The rooms are just perfect. The only downside is that there are not enough beds by the pool. The staff want to please you the whole time.   The sea lounge is for breakfast for the executive rooms. It has the view of the gateway which is one of the missy beautiful sites in Mumbai. However the executive lounge
"There is no other way to summarise a stay at this Hotel. If you can, then do.  Its a stand alone reason to visit the city. You can easily spend a few days here without venturing further than the Gates of India across the road.  Its the best service i have ever experience. Forget your Hiltons etc....this is the real old style deal."
"Who are all these people on here slating this place - it is so lovely to step inside the Taj after being outside in the heat and noise of Mumbai, to go to a really comfortable bedroom, have a swim in the huge (33m) deep pool and lie by the pool watching the bats fly over the sunset, have an (overpriced) drink in the bar; and wake up to the most extensive breakfast you are probably going to have anywhere in India.  Cant fault the place - we got a good rate the day before we booked - staying in the Tower.  Totally reccomend this hotel.  Unpretentious, comfortable and great location"
"Great landmark in south Mumbai...built by the great TATA. Location is perfect, just opposite the famous Gateway of India. Was a victim in terrorist attacks but bounced back well. Enjoy your stay in The Taj, Mumbai :)"
"We visited the Taj hotel back in March. The hotel lobby was very crowded as everyone could sit there which made it look more like a circus than a luxury hotel. We went to lunch at Sea Lounge and the service was appalling. We waited for more than 20 minutes for a menu to be brought to us. When we mentioned that we didn't have any rupees and would like to pay in USD, the manager told us to exchange the money downstairs at the hotel. This is quite unacceptable for a luxury hotel. Wifi is only for guests staying at the hotel, not for restaurant guests. However, the Sea Lounge is a very cosy place and we happened to get a table for 2 by the window with wonderful view of the Gateway to India and the harbour."
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel as the name suggests, spells class and royalty!  We stayed in the Heritage wing in the Suite room.  It was grand!  Very spacious and royal!  Enjoyed our two day stay in luxury.  Very clean rooms and corridors, friendly and polite staff and good ambience, befitting its name.  Of course, compared to other newer five star properties, it lacks the poshness and sleek decor, but it has its own charm.    The buffet breakfast spread is very good but we did not like the quality of the food served for the conference dinner and banquet."
"We have stayed two nights in the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai on the end of our two weeks trip to India. The hotel is like a palace and the area around is wonderful. We had good service, and good help in every thing we asked for. The staff was very nice and polite. Also the food was good and fit to us as non spicy taste. Also the area around the hotel was nice and easy to go there."
"Ok where can I start? This Taj just exudes class. The staff made me feel very welcome, and I felt very safe in the hotel. Plenty of restaurants at the Taj with top notch food and matching service! The only thing I didn't like was the WiFi, as it was too slow, just enough to read e-mails. I  signed up for the premium plan which cost around 16 USD for 24 hrs. Other then that I have nothing to complain about and I'll happily stay there again."
Not sure where to start with this hotel but this is as good as a hotel you are likely to find anywhere in the world. It is expensive to stay there in comparison with other hotels in Mumbai and overall in India but its more than worth it especially if you're only in town for a few days. In the perfect location in the Colaba district and opposite the Gateway to India.   Can take between 45-75 minutes to arrive there from the airport depending on traffic but once you're there its easy to get around on foot and in taxis which are cheap and plentiful. We got upgraded to the palace section of the hotel - a must do - pay if you have to. Rooms are amazing and the hotel is in pristine condition. The breakfast is also superb and plentiful.  The pool area is very impressive too and the
"We are currently guests at the Taj Palace and am very disappointed that at 5pm in the afternoon the swimming pool is closed for maintenance. After a day of shopping and wondering around Mumbai all we want to do is chill out at the pool and have a swim to cool off. Very disappointed that this is not available to us.   Otherwise, so far excellent service and very nice breakfast in the Sea Lounge."
"This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The service is outstanding. The room was nice too and comfortable. The restaurants in the hotel are great. We hired a driver to take us around the city for the day, it was so cheap, the car was comfortable and he was amazing. If I could live there I would!"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is one of the most luxurious hotels I have ever stayed in and a nice sanctuary from the crowded streets of Mumbai. I was upgraded to the historic palace section and treated like royalty throughout my stay. The room was beautifully decorated, combining old charm and modern facilities. The only negative I have is the cost of eating at the hotel is very expensive.  Stayed in April 2015."
"We stayed at the palace wing of the hotel.  Beautiful room and bathroom.  A large soaking tub and many amenities.  Complementary Cognac and chocolate in the evening. The pool area is beautiful.  The staff is very helpful. The breakfast buffet is one of the best I have encountered. The hotel has several restaurants and they are all amazing. I used the spa and it was a unique experience.   We took the ferry to the Elephanta caves.  The hotel is within walking distance of shopping, restaurants, museums and houses of worship.  Overall it was a great experience."
Stayed here at the end of March 2015.  I arranged for airport pick up and they were there to greet us on time and with no issues.  The car they sen was a little small for 4 passengers w/ 8 pieces of luggage but we still made it work.  Someone greeted us at arrival and we were taken to our rooms immediately.  Check in was simple.  The hotel is slightly dated but still very beautiful.  We ate at Masala Kraft the first night and it was excellent.  The next night we ate at Wasabi and it was equally as good.  We hired a driver and did a day tour arranged by the concierge and it was very good.  Saw a lot of Mumbai in 4 hours.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Mumbai.
The ambience of the hotel is very soothing and the food is equally great. The hotel has sea facing restaurant on the first floor which provides a very relaxed and comfortable feeling to the customers. Also the starboard bar is new age and has one of the finest liqueurs. One must visit  The masala if fond of Indian food and the Golden dragon for chinese
"Stayed at the Taj in February after watching Hotel India. It didn't disappoint. We stayed in a suite In the palace Wing and attention to detail in the room was excellent.  We had our own butler and nothing was too much trouble. We went on a city tour day and when we arrived back to our rooms,they had left rose water foot baths for us. My only criticism was breakfast.  Very busy as large hotel and unless you like your breakfast at 7.30 there was often a queue in the sea lounge and there would be a long time from ordering to arrival. We only dined one evening at the hotel at their Indian restaurant which was lovely albeit very expensive as were all their restaurants. The most important tip I can give is to stay in the Palace Wing which is the older, traditional side to the hotel."
"My friend and I visited this fabulous hotel. It is stunning in every aspect. Backpackers, families, travelers and guests in all types of clothing are allowed to enter and dine in the hotel. We ate in the sea lounge. The waiters were very happy to get us a window table at the nearest possible opportunity. For India, it is very expensive but if the food was nice it would be worth the money for the view. The food was so disappointing. Medicore sandwiches and burger. It tasted like reheated frozen food. I wouldn't recommend eating in this lounge at all. The coffee and fruit juices were nice."
"still a good hotel but too many tourist around the hall, garden , swimming pool, restaurants. Group of people enter the hotel taking pictures , going to toilets, visiting as a museum all day long. No privacy for guest. Hotel cars too much priced fore Mumbay costs."
"This hotel lights you up from the time you step in to the time you leave. This place is brilliant. The staff is really good. I had an event at the Rooftop Rendezvous and it was perfectly organised. The staff was very helpful and the food was great.  I had a few Britishers with me who were awestruck by the beauty of the TAJ. If you have the money and time to spend, go here without fail. I bet you will be spoilt during your stay. Great work TAJ. Keep it up!!"
"One of the reasons that I always go to Mumbai when I visit India is because i want to revisit this magical hotel.   The ambience, efficiency and service is, in my opinion, world class. There is a feeling of being treated as if you are special, without a sense of insincerity. The breakfast selection is amazing and you can eat in the spacious restaurant or take it into the beautiful garden or undercover loggia, and be server by waiters or help yourself. The Pool is divine and there is a feeling of being in an oasis while in the bustling city of Mumbai. There is nothing that I don't like about this hotel."
"One of the outstanding Hotel we have ever visited. Great location central to shops and sights. The breakfast was one of the outstanding features for us, take your time and ENJOY ! The only negative is the cost of eating in the hotel is very expensive but is worth doing it."
"After watching the documentary on BBC1 about this amazing hotel we always said, when we go back to Mumbai we would stay there for at least a few nights and we did- We decided to take the Club Room option as we felts that as we were only there for a limited time, it would be great to spend all of that time in the hotel, using the facilities and making good use of the rest-bite from the crazy city. I cannot say one bad word about this hotel. I wish other 5 star hotels were similar to this. The building, the history, the service, the facilities, the air!! everything was superb."
"Small wonder the Taj Palace is theTaj chain's flagship. It oozes heritage, style, elegance, history, service and delight in equal measure. And it knows how to play to those strengths.  The staff were exceptional (special reference Shrimi Saloni) - friendly, curteous and professional. The building, particularly the Palace wing, is without peer in India and probably the world. In fact one minor concern is the sheer number of tourists visiting the establishment to gaze wide-eyed and take photos, before getting back on the tour bus.  There were minor quibbles (what hotel is ever 100% perfect?) - a limited in-room dining menu, astronomical prices in most restaurants, access to the 2008 memorial through a restaurant - but they do not detract from the sense of experience that is"
"The service and accommodations at the hotel are superb.  The airport pick up and drop off were seamless and, unlike many other auto trips in India, not terrifying.  The check in was handled in a very personal and easy way.  The building is truly wonderful, and the pool and restaurants first class. The concierge service both before arriving to arrange transit and while there to arrange tours was first rate.   Having said all that, please be sure to note that every service and restaurant in the hotel are London/New York prices or a bit more.  Recalling an experience at the old Peninsula in Hong Kong I was ready to put my shoes out for a shine, until I read the notice that the training for the shine came from John Lobb in London and the standard shoe shine would be $35 US and the"
"What a joy staying at this hotel Full of colonial charm, fantastic restaurant and bars. Great location. Just love it - would not stay anywhere else in Mumbai. Excellent location in Mumbai and the service was very special."
What a great hotel. We stayed in the newer section and it was amazing.   Rooms are are large and very neat. Shower is in the bath but works well.   Breakfast is a buffet menu with lots of variety but mainly vegetarian.   Staff are friendly and helpful.   Lots of restaurants to choose from and shopping choices are multiple.   Highly recommended
"Really words dont' describe how beatuiful this hotel is. Every element of the stay was perfect. The service is outstanding, the location is right in front of the Gateway to India. The food in the hotel restaurants and bars is also superb. However, this won't be a cheap stay but worth every cent!!"
This is probably the most famous landmark of Mumbai and a great hotel.The restaurants within the hotel are quite popular as well. The staff is quite friendly and you can expect the best of class service.
"The Taj is an impressive building with a lot of history.  We have been fortunate to stay at some very nice hotels and resorts and the Taj does not make the top five.  Don't get me wrong this place is good but just not great.   The staff does know how to make service recovery but it could be that they have practice at it.   -- A couple of examples; one being that when we checked into our suite the room was very musty as if it been empty and the air was very stuffy. They immediately asked if we wanted to move and we declined and just suggested they bring some air freshener.  This they did promptly.  They, without asking, provided a nice foot soothing bath later in the day.  Also, on the second day they sent some roses with an acknowledgement of the rooms condition.   However,"
We watched the TV program of the hotel  & we're very impressed.........when we arrived we were even more impressed....... They said they were up grading us but me being scepticle thought the worst but  No . Because of my wife's birthday we were given a River Room showing the Gate Way to India   .  The floor was covered in Balloons & the bath was run & full of  Foam & Red Rose petals..... Our floor Butler came in to  introduce himself  with a huge piece of Chocolate cake. The Hotel is Fabulous & full of old World Charm ......they  arrange a guided tour of the hotel at 5 pm that should not be missed. . Fabulous.......
"The Taj has been getting it right for so long it's hard to imagine them ever getting it wrong. The best known and most respected hotel in India it has a special place in the hearts not only of Bombay residents but Indians generally. Expensive as one would expect but an absolute oasis of calm and tranquility in the chaos of Bombay (and yes, even the locals still call it Bombay). Rooms in the Tower less glamorous but less expensive and still superbly appointed. Many differing cuisines available and bizarrely, the best meal we had in India was at the Chinese restaurant. Well worth making the effort to stay for a truly memorable experienc."
"We took a flight from goa to mumbai whilst on our hols in goa just to stay a night at this wonderful, charming hotel. We arrived at 11 am and although we thought our room wouldn't be available before 2 were happily surprised our room was ready. We stayed on floor 4 of the palace side in an extremely comfortable room. A butler came to meet us with fresh fruit and explained all the services we could expect. The bathroom was full of luxury items you could have stayed in and pampered lol.  We took the 5 o clock tour of this marvellous historical hotel with a young man who spoke 33 languages and now learning Welsh. We asked for a tour of mumbai for the following day (always do through the hotel as local taxis will rip you off) we was given a free upgrade and had a capped chauffeur"
"Fantastic location Great hotel Rooms are fantastic Very friendly staff, they always want to please their customer  great food Classic historical building at his best very well restore a museum by itself a must in India"
"Heard so much about this Grand hotel...we stayed in 2 rooms in the new wing and the rooms were anything but new, very tired, my daughters compared the rooms to a motel. Thats the negative as for everything around this hotel it is charming, grand, historical and the pool area picks you up and takes you back 100 years, stunning."
"Its is really amazing to see the beauty of the Hotel. Although services and other facilities are perfect, room is best and even room service is amazing and up to the mark. The most awesome part of the hotel is the architecture and the beauty it is mesmerizing. It is truly a palace in its own way. The way staff has maintained such a wonderful quality that no one will feel like going out of the hotel."
"WOW. We loved this hotel. Its so historic, grand, wonderful.  When we arrived we had an incredibly warm welcome from Sam in the main building who advised us that we had been upgraded. Now that’s how to look after your guests.   We mentioned to her that it was our honeymoon and a few hours later there were balloons, pillows and cake in our room wishing us congratulations.   Food here is fantastic. The location is right outside the India gate one of the main tourist attractions in Mumbai.  Internet is excellent and you can use it on three devices.   In the late afternoon we went on a 1 hour tour with a guy who did a brilliant tour of the hotel and that was fascinating. In the evening we ate in the Mediterranean restaurant at the top of the Tower section of the hotel and it was"
"I said I'd write a review of our second stay at the Taj on New Year's Eve so here we go. If you managed to read my previous review, you'll have seen we were a little disappointed with a number of things at the hotel. This time and in short, they did everything possible to make sure we were happy and comfortable but if you like detail, read on. We flew back from our trip to Cochin and Alleppey on New Year's Eve and the hotel car was waiting for us at the airport. After a pleasant drive, we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by a delightful young lady at the door who acknowledged that we'd had a few problems and she was here to show us to our room. We'd booked a standard Club room this time as we were only staying for one night before our flight back to London (sincerely hoping"
"They say that quality is more important than quantity. I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for just one day with my Wife and daughter but it was an unforgettable experience. Right from the moment you enter the hotel, the staff makes you feel special. My daughter Ananya is 9 Months old and the hotel staff within moments of checking in made a small card in her name and took our photo. Then a person named Viren escorted us all the way to the room. We were to check in at 2 PM as per rules, but we checked in 2 hours before. I had requested the 12th floor and what we got was the 21st floor. The view of the sea was mesmerizing. There was a separate channel called the Taj Channel. I can say confidently that among all the places I have visited, this was my best stay ever. Not only this"
Although having booked via a Agoda (discounted room) I was nevertheless given a complimentary upgrade from the Tower (cheap seats) to a room in the original Palace. Everything was spectacular. Attenntion to detail high. Great pool area and location at Gateway.  It came across to me that many staff had a true love for the hotel and experience they were providing guests. Very impressed. Take the (free) 5.00pm tour if you have time.
Absolutely adored this hotel. What a view!! What a pool and the service so attentive. Great range of choice in Restaurants and Breakfast buffet is second to none. A splurge but well worth it. An oasis in the best position in Mumbai.
Wonderful - could not fault the hotel in any way - the best hotel we stayed at in India and one that all visitors to Mumbai should experience. The best example of how a hotel should be managed that I have come across in a long time. The location helps! A star above all other 5 star hotels in India.  
"We flew in with BA for an overnight stay in Mumbai before heading on to Goa the next day. From the moment we checked in we felt like royalty.   We went for a club room, but were upgraded to a beautiful suite.  The Club lounge afternoon tea and cocktails/canape's were fantastic and white glove service impeccable.   Went to the pool when it cooled down, and again service was great there and spotlessly clean.  Only thing that let the experience down was the quality of the chicken nuggets ordered from room service for my youngest daughter,  grey processed meat, not chicken breast. 2 minute walk to Gate of India which i"
This is definitely one of the most beautiful and well run hotels in the world.  I would try to stay in the old part of the hotel.  The pool is beautiful.  We had a gorgeous view of the Gateway to India from our room.
"From my previous reviews, one will note that I am a fan of Taj properties and I benchmark them to each other using my experience of the Taj Lands End in Mumbai as the benchmark. With that, I introduce the masala chai index. 5 cups being the benchmark.   My wife and I stayed at the Taj Mahal palace for 4 nights in early March. Stayed in the palace wing. Has a third floor room with a partial sea view... Here goes:  (1) quality of masala chai - 3 cups out of 5.    We tried all sorts of permutations and combinations (asking for it to be made stronger, more milk, less milk etc)...just does not get to the lands end standard.   (2) rooms - 4 out of 5 cups..  It's a heritage building and palace rooms are on the smaller side but done up in the last few years. Very modern. Decent size"
Great place...was there for one night...Like a palace as the name suggests...got a complimentary upgrade to Taj club room..welcome drink and garlands.....with butler service and all....High tea...cocktail hours...had some wine by the pool...Rooms are good...my room had a perfect view..of gateway of india...since it was raining..the view was even better....my son loved the bathtub...tea in royal utensils....a unique experience....beyond satisfactory on the positive side of number line..))
"We have just returned from a fabulous trip to India with Great Rail Journeys and an extension supported by TCI.  Both companies looking after us fantastically.  Anyway we finished at the Taj and we really enjoyed, the hotel, the food and wine and the service.  Such a special experience following such a special holiday."
"This hotel is neither the most modern or luxurious hotel in town. It's reputation is history, location, service and the recent BBC documentary. Big ticks on all counts.  Good points: - fab breakfast (incl in our rate) - great views -   Gripes are: - restaurants all booked out early and good outside options a taxi ride away - super expensive and everything costs.... a bit like Disney - snobby staff on front desk - very strong secuity delays... but this has the benefit of safety - asked for room preferences multiple time months in advance but didn't have them ready  My biggest issue would be how petty front desk policies are and how a colonial deference to white skin is not a way a great marketing sell for Indian hotels living off past laurels. For example, flower garlands seems"
We enjoyed 3 nights at the Taj at the start of our trip.  We had a great view of the Gateway and Harbour and really enjoyed the club room facilities. Everyone was friendly and helpful and we would recommend it
"There are many fine hotels around the world but very few which are so attentive to service and comfort and every detail, as the TAJ Mumbai. Every member of staff is an expert in his/her field, and delivers with aplomb, politeness and a smile. - Nothing is too much!  The accommodation, the pool area, the public spaces and the shops are elegant and excellent, and the streets around are always abuzz and exciting."
Nice place! Breakfast is about 1800rps each with coffee but worth the luxury having travelled from Goa on the way back to Kerala.  It's possible to do in a taxi if you have 6 hrs to wait for connecting flight (international airport) and you can see the clothes washing area Mumbai on the way back via taxi.
"We stayed at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel at the start of our recent holiday in South India. The experience was without parallel, the service was faultless and the breakfasts magnificent. Everything about the hotel was brilliant from the views of the Gateway to India and the harbour to the staff, nothing was too much trouble. A fantastic start to our holiday!"
We have visited this hotel several times over the past 20 years. I was pleased with the suite and the views were magnificent. The hotel has great presence and the staff are really interested in looking after the customers. The staff are well trained and service is excellent and they try their best to make your stay comfortable. Room service was a little slow and the food ordinary but the restaurants are very good. Authentic and rustic dishs very well seasoned. The hotel is really quite an experience just avoid the room service.
"One of the iconic hotels of Mumbai!! We were so fortunate to spend our short honeymoon here. Everything leaves you in an awe, right from the moment you enter, you feel like a royal!! Everything is perfect and taken care of. We stayed at the new wing of the hotel, and had a room facing the iconic Gateway..spellbound!! Needless to say the view was amazing, and so was the room!  We had dinner at the Shamiana and it was indeed very lavish and very gourmet . We also ordered in-room dinning and really enjoyed it. Thank you for making me so spoilt and for the wonderful hospitality. Would always cherish staying at this marvellous icon!!"
"Taj staff make you feel as though nothing is too much trouble, we felt like VIP's for every second we were there! They could not have done more to make us welcome and comfortable.  The building is beautiful and the stories and history romantic and enchanting!  We planned just 1 night but immediately booked a 2nd, changing tours and flights to extend the experience!  Rahul the bar manager was a delight and his team at the bar  gave us the ""Cocktail story"" - ask for it, not to be missed!"
"We loved our time at the Taj. From the airport pick-up to check out it was great.  We went for our Honeymoon and they upgraded us to a suite on the fifth floor of the Palace building. They brought us cake and chocolates when we arrived and dressed our room with rose petals and heart balloons.  The room was fantastic with a free standing bath and separate shower room.  We had a whole range of extras including breakfast in the Sea Palace restaurant which was fantastic, and brandy and chocolates in the ground floor bar.   All of the staff who looked after us were amazing.  I left an item in the room and they emailed me to let me know and then couriered the item back to my address in London at no extra charge. Whenever I've left anything in a hotel room before anywhere in the world,"
its arael palace excellent hotel wonderful rooms delecious indian food excellent service welcoming staff every thing excellent except it should be in another cleaner city than Bombay which full of pollution
We were unable to stay at the Taj but made the cross town journey to eat at its Lebanese restaurant. The buildings are very characterful and the restaurant has fine views across the city. The food was absolutely wonderful and was matched by the service. The staff were kind enough to arrange access to the resident only central courtyard for coffee afterwards.
"I stayed for just one night (28th march till 29th march) and in this short period of time THE TAJ MAHAL PALACE MUMBAI have impressed me so much that I would have to say this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at. I was there to celebrate my fist anniversary and made the reservation at the tower wing. My flight arrived at 9am in the morning and i was at the hotel by 10, upon check in I was informed by the staff that I have been upgraded to the Palace wing, as I was celebrating a special occasion with them, I was truly speechless, firstly because the palace wing was famous for the celebs and royalty that has stayed there and such rich history behind it. More over the price difference is almost double of what I have paid for the tower wing and all this is now compliments"
"There is no better experience than what the Taj offers in the original part of the hotel.  There is also a new tower addition that looks like a standard corporate hotel, so spring if you can for the original building which has been updated.  Again, spring for the water view overlooking the sea and the Gate.  It is old world charm and service updated."
"The lobby area is so warm and inviting, with a beautiful fragrance wafting through the air. The breakfast is to die for. We had a sea-facing room. Pity we only stayed here for one night. The bed linen could have been softer though. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for its comfort and luxury."
"We spent five weeks traveling India but only one night at the Taj Mahal. I let the hotel know in advance that is was our 13th anniversary, and they went out of their way to make it special, filling our room with heart-shaped balloons, drawing a bath with rose petals, sending up a slice of rich chocolate cake, etc. All the romantic cliches you can think of, but thoughtful nonetheless.   We paid for a sea-facing luxury room in the original palace hotel. We had a fabulous view of the Arabian Sea and the Gateway of India. (I highly recommend waking with the sun to see the colors play out over the harbor.) The rooms have every amenity you could ever possibly want or need, from huge, fluffy towels and high-end toiletries to bath robes and working WiFi (alas, we sprang for the premium"
"Stayed for a weekend night at the Palace wing of the hotel with my family. The hotel certainly lived up to its reputation as one of the finest in the country. The check-in was smooth, the room was spacious with all the modern amenities. & the service was warm and thoughtful - they had some toys for the kids to play with too.  Lots of fine restaurants both in and around the property to try out.  Overall a lovely 5 star property, with a lot of history, heritage  and charm."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a gorgeous hotel with an old world elegance, high quality service and excellent location, overlooking the Arabian Sea and the Gateway of India and Arabian Sea. The hotel is a beautiful sanctuary from the crowded streets of Mumbai. We were upgraded from the Tower Wing to the historic Palace section. The room was beautifully decorated, combining old charm and modern facilities. It was not very spacious, but large enough. The panoramic view from our room of the bay and the Gateway of India is spectacular.  Breakfast is excellent and served in a beautiful restaurant. The Palace Lounge is beautiful and serves complementary tea to guests who stay at the Palace section. I also liked the Masala Kraft restaurant at the lobby level, which serves very tasty Indian"
"I was here for a week end stay, and to my surprise i was upgraded from the Taj tower to the Palace which is the old wing......that is the first delight point i received. with an exclusive lounge for a wonderful check in experience. The stay was just splendid a marvelous view and especially the heritage tour that happens every evening at this place is a wonderful insight into the beautifully crafted property.The Dinner at Masala Kraft was awesome with warm and courteous staff.  the pool is quite refreshing and really an awesome property to either have a quiet family vacation or just have a romantic getaway in the hustle and bustle of the city yet cocooned away in your own private space."
"Brilliant service, brilliant place to begin a new year. Took the club room and got a complimentary pick up from the airport which is miles away from the hotel. But everything from the food to rooms to complimentary high tea and post dinner chocolate and cognac was awesome. Truly felt like a king."
"We went to Taj just for a weekend break and it certainly was the most refreshing experience. Its the best example of a perfect mix of contemporary and royal. The views inside out are breathtaking but what touches your heart the most is the service. The staff never ceases to make you feel special. The pool, the spa, the restaurants and particularly the palace lounge keep creating awesome memories for you.  We would love to visit the Taj again and again.  We could enjoy this at a special else the price could be the only criteria that could hold us back from frequent visits."
Its one of the best hotel I ever stayed. If you visit Mumbai and can afford it stay at this hotel. It is a great experience with great location and service. Lot of good restaurants nearby. Easy location to start exploring the city.
Off out cruise ship we toured Mumbsi with a walk through of this beautiful hotel. Security is very high after the incident a number of years ago with cars checked under the hood and trunk. Lobby is cool lively and expansive. Hotel is across from Gateway to India.
"We have wanted to stay at the Taj Palace for a while so it was the first place we booked when we decided to travel to India this March.  A very smart car and driver picked us up from the airport (bliss after a long flight from London) and the Taj experience started from there.  The hotel is everything and more than you imagine and the position is superb.  We had a lovely room overlooking the Gateway of India and were pampered by the staff from the room to the restaurants and the wonderful spa and pool.  Massages were amazing, all the food and drink was delicious - don't miss out on the wonderful cocktails nor the ""high tea"" in the Sea Lounge - sort of tea at the Ritz meets India.  Delicious Indian bites alongside traditional English tea favourites.  Breakfast is superb - can be"
"Amazing place! It appeared even better than we expected. Authentic atmosphere, perfect restaurants, feeling like it's 1890 now. The building itself is a masterpiece - those halls, waterfall and tiles... You have to visit the pool at the evening, so relaxing and the sounds from the outside help you to feel the real oasisness of the place. The breakfast is more then 5 stars. The Consierge Service is helpful and can arrange you evrth you need, the price is high but it's worth if you want to spen your Mumbai time the same high class way as the hotel is. Highly recommend! And, by the way, this is the important Shantaram place!"
Tried the Lobster Thermidor at the Shamiana last week and it was the best I had in a very long time.  Even the Sea Lounge offered great Risotto with a very pleasant view of the Gateway.  Great food at both the fine dining restaurants.
"Thank you to the TATA group in maintaining one of India's greatest heritage hotels in such fantastic style. The upkeep was as excellent and the staff, was super friendly, courteous and always at hand. Wonderful memories to stay forever.  Some tips/hints.... Leaving tip is not always easy.. ""What to leave for our appreciation to great service and staff, and to whom.. ""?? Suggestion which we did and worked ok I think... 2000 INR for the breakfast staff who continuously ran around after my kids serving their every need.. Just give it to one of the staff.. They all pool the tips.. 1000 INR/room for the housekeeping staff..  A few hundred for the bellboys... And I didn't tip senior staff, like receptionists, or suited managers...  I think this was ok.. And I felt it was"
"It's hard to put the Taj Mahal Palace experience to words. For me, it is undoubtedly the best hotel in India. Its funny how it feels bad to call it a hotel. To call it a Palace is not really a  hyperbole. I don't have to say much about the ambience or the grandiose as it is what symbolises the Taj Mahal Palace.  But one thing which sets it apart from the rest is its hospitality. The hotel staff is so genuinely willing to serve you that it is hard to miss it. Smiling genuinely at every guest, I wonder if they hire the happiest people in the world.  I would specially like to mention Concierge service staff Mr.Mahesh. We had a packet to courier and Mahesh did everything to get our job done. He was genuinely concerned when the pick up boy took longer than his regular time to arrive."
"We stayed for one night over the weekend in a room in the main building. The hotel itself is really nice, old fashioned tastefully decorated excellent staff. We did not get an upgrade as so many people seem to have received even though we opted for the pricier heritage room option. Maybe they were really full. What we liked: - Well maintained heritage hotel with lots of tasteful decorations and furniture everywhere. - Early check-in (11 am), later check-out (14 pm) - Room was nice and spacious - well trained staff in all areas - Large pool - Excellent location to roam around Colaba What we didn't like: - Birds especially pigeons everywhere molesting people by the pool and at the breakfast outside tables - Bird feces covering the outside building - Pool is very noisy due to the"
"had a great stay,fine help from the staff arranging a nightout to a club LIV.. the experience was wonderful,cannot remember the name of the nice lady that helped us check in but she was really charming and made us at ease with the sweet gesture of a garland.. this is one Hotel that won my heart,and m thinking of spending my birthday there in June..the best way to deal with the heat and humidity in Mumbai,will be to experience the refreshing gush the Taj way *wink"
No need to go through the benefits of this hotel item by item as absolutely everything was first class.  Concierge service superb accommodating many of our difficult requests.  Fantastic food and the nicest pool area imaginable.  An oasis in the center of the great city of Mumbai.  I can't imagine better.
"The most iconic hotel in the world. Lunch or dinner is a must on our yearly visit to Mumbai. The service is impeccable and the staff are some of the most wonderful people you can meet. The shops are like being in Aladin's cave. The artwork, the decor, the ambiance of the hotel is in undescribeable. Simply put ... The hotel is elegance personified."
"I stayed for a few days in a lovely room in the Palace wing. While many aspects of the hotel are 'standard international' (odd luxury boutiques catering to people who forgot to pack their diamonds and space velvet dinner jackets), lobbies and restaurants, there was such a high level of friendly service that I was totally won over.  From the attentive staff on reception and check-in, to the everpresent staff in every hallway, to the wonderful team in the restaurant managing to seat everyone in what appeared to be the best room in the house!  Views and location were stunning and the position next to the Gateway to India and within easy access of the architecture and sights of south Mumbai was excellent.  While I've stayed in friendly hotels, and experienced wonderful service, this"
"The Taj Mahal Palace WOW WOW WOW  I saw this place on a BBC TV program called ‘Hotel India’ ....their motto ‘the guest is god’ sounded like I’d fancy a bit of that...  So we booked for 4 days after a few weeks in Goa – I did my homework and booked a ‘club room’ in the main hotel Palace Wing and it was a special anniversary treat for me and my partner.  So we arrived in Mumbai airport from Goa and it started – picked up in a luxurious black Jaguar, drinks, cold towels, magazines – lovely and then we arrive at the beautiful beautiful beautiful hotel. We had a lovely welcome....   BUT THEN IT STARTS..we were so lucky to be upgraded to the Seagull Suite – opulent just doesn’t do it justice.  This wonderful suite comes with a massive living room and dining room, overlooks the Gateway"
"No matter if you were born a princess or you want to be treated like one for a day - this is the place to come. A hotel to treat yourself to, or to treat a person you love. You will experience exceptional service from friendly, committed staff, many who have who are proud to have worked there all their lives. Arriving  back from a shopping trip, with bags full of treasures. shoes, silk scarves, jewelry. Prada, Cartier, Hermes? No all from the stalls on the Coldaba Causeway, but still the gentlemen smile, ask if I have had a good time and offer to take my  plastic bags full of my treasures,  to my room.  No pomp or snobbery, just excellent service.  Fabulous lobby, pool and dining areas and breakfast to die for. Tower rooms are a bit dated but cosy; probably like the Queens"
"Service average,had to ask for a lot of things,cold food,missed requests,staff like robots,check in bad,watched the BBC documentary and was craving for the stars of the show but didn't find them. Have to compliment the tour guide Viren,very refreshing!Only wish all the staff were staff like him,passion and drive,he makes the Taj experience...bland &  bored staff disappointing. Please don't forget the service standards,wonderful building and location"
"Mentioned to the dining room attendant, female, that the parathas they served for breakfast were chewy and rubbery. Her reply was""this is how they are"" I mentioned that in other hotels and at home they were not. Her reply was "" in that case I will have to come to your house to try them."" The complaint was never passed on to the chef and to this day the number one hotel in mumbai is continuing to serve chewy rubber. On another occasion while in the lift to the top floor restaurant  a female staff latched on to us uninvited, brought the chef out to  us without asking for him and said ""I have bribed him to give you good food. A very cheap remark when you are paying £50 per head!!!! Taj should send staff for training to marriott in juhu A hotel where not a single fault was found,"
"I just spent five nights at the taj mahal palace in Mumbai, and it was sheer luxury!     The service in the hotel is just amazing, and the setting so unique by its history and refinement.   My room oversaw the Gateway of India, and each morning opened the prospect of another great day.   The location is excellent as you can walk around safely around the hotel, and is close to other landmarks.   This is the place to stay in Mumbai!!"
"I booked a one night stay in the palace wing of the hotel for some friends and having heard so much about the hotel (BBC documentaries etc) they were very disappointed that the service did not live upto the ""hype"", for example fresh toast, plenty of tea and coffee, and some eggs would be something that you should be able to take for granted ? apparently not.  I contacted the duty manager twice by email (and once over the phone) to report the problems that my friends encountered yet he has not seen fit to respond or acknowledge my complaint.  When i stayed at the hotel previously with my wife were made to feel very special and the service was exemplary, it is very sad to see that standards appear to have dropped to such an extent."
"The hotel is so beautiful, it's an experience on it's own. Be it the amazing architecture, or the interior designing of the Elephanta Suite that I stayed in, or the restaurants- the Taj is a cracker in every field. The location is as good as it gets. Lovely and helpful services."
"This is an outstanding hotel by any standard. It was a privilege to stay here and luxuriate in the opulence provided by the Taj. The level of service has to be experienced to believe it. From initial registration to final departure we could find no fault with any aspect of this hotel. High Tea provided every day in the Sea Lounge is a true delight and a treat not to be missed. We had a lovely room in the Tower overlooking the India Gateway, but having seen the rooms in the Palace we would definitely opt form oe of those next time."
"The Taj Mahal Palace closed the Mumbai leg of our trip and what a finale. The customer service is exceptional, the room was beautiful - everything was just perfect. We had our evening meal at the Souk restaurant, which stands on the very top floor of the hotel, which again was another phenomenal experience. We spent the day relaxing by the pool and despite the fact the hotel is situated in central Mumbai, you are totally relaxed in the most beautiful, peaceful surroundings. The nicest thing I seemed to find about the hotel was that it didn't matter whether you are staying for one night in the deluxe room (which was what we did!) or spending weeks in one of the top suites of the entire hotel - the staff are just so keen to ensure your stay is perfect, and they did a faultless,"
"Stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace mid February 2015 after many years away from the hotel chain and India. The professional courteous staff is still on their game. My friend hired a hotel car and driver and was very pleased. However, I was surprised with the breakfast as to the limited number of selections (no smoked salmon and few other Asian selections other than Indian) and with the fact that dishes were not replenished no matter what time one came to breakfast. I was also surprised with our top tower room and with the level of wear shown on the furniture and cabinets. On the other hand, the fairly spacious room looked out directly at the Gate of India -the best location for all of Mumbai. (A day trip to Elephant Island leave conveniently from the Gate). The large pristine pool"
"I was put up at the Taj for two nights. There is nothing about Taj that you won't like. It is a beautiful property in a beautiful location. Apollo Bandar is probably the prettiest part of Mumbai. The Gateway right in front of the hotel, the sea and the relatively quite roads are experiences unmatched to anything else. Coming to the hotel, it is artistically done. The room facilities are normal five star standard. Breakfast spread is grand and more often than not you will bump into one or the other Indian celebrities at the restaurants. The location of the hotel is very premium, you have some very famous restaurants close by. Colaba area is close by. You should spend a night at this place for sure. "
"We visited the Taj Mahal Palace hotel for 2 nights for our 19th wedding anniversary from 18th February. After seeing this hotel on a 6 part documentary in the UK we thought it would be the ideal place to celebrate our anniversary. It was the best decision we made, we had an unbelievable time at a fantastic hotel!! I cannot praise the staff enough for the fantastic service we received and makeing us feel at home! Fantastic hotel, great service and cannot wait to return!!"
"I was visiting Mumbai as part of a tour and was eager to visit the Taj palace as u had heard about it in the past. We arranged to have high tea there and from the moment I walked through the doors into the floral scented air conditioned lobby, I knew this was going to be an experience. The hotel is beautiful and steeped in history, there are photos throughout and it feels like you are stepping back in time.  We made our way to the  beautiful ambient sea breeze lounge and we were treated like royalty. The food was amazing and plentiful and even ager they had stopped serving us the seemingly never ending supply of snacks and tea, we where then told that we Could help ourselves to the buffet. The food was displayed impeccably but we were totally full from everything we had already"
"Hotel is great, always full. Located in the heart of MUMBAY. Room is great with good bad and good shower and bathroom. Everything you need is located nearby including synagogue Service great, food ok. Stuff helpfull"
"We joined the hotel tour with our friends who were guests at the Taj, the tour was very well presented and interesting but if I was a guest in the bar or areas we walked around I am not sure I would have been very happy with a large group of people descending on my peace and quiet!  Our meal that night (we were a group of around 10) was very good, we were advised on courses as some of our party were eating vegetarian.  Our friends only had access up to the second floor where their room was, and with the new tower at the side of the Taj I suspect that areas of the hotel will become even more exclusive for the more elite more expensive  rooms and guests / VIP's with money to spend.  Having eaten there and seen the inside of the hotel it is very stunning and steeped in history,"
good hotel .it was a good exp with such a good staff during business trip.thanks to all staff n manager.all staff members are giid n thet serve healthy n tadty food.servuce is goid too. N moreiver location is excelnt.
"Visited Taj Palace for Afternoon Tea,   Sea View restaurant - Awesome , never expected you have such a choice to have with your Afternoon Tea, food was excellent , authentic Indian taste , Freshly baked scones with cream , perfect 5* service , would surely visit again"
The Taj is stuffed full of history and we had a wonderful stay.  It was our anniversary so we were upgraded to a palace room which was beautiful.  All of the staff were extremely professional and friendly - the butler service in the particular was fantastic.  
"When we visited Mumbai, we stayed at both the Taj and the Oberoi and submit the review from this perspective. The Taj is a beautiful hotel, both externallly and internally. The swimming pool area is fabulous and there are plenty of little areas to sit and soak up the atmosphere. On a couple of evenings we sat outside and enjoyed the barbecue, which was pretty decent, but pretty dear. Our room was situated in the Tower, was very comfortable with a lovely view of the sea and Gateway of India , however for a luxury hotel, the attention to detail was not quite there, especially in comparison to the lobby,pool and bar areas. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay."
"I'm spending a couple of days here to begin my first tour of India. Impeccable service in a beautiful and elegant hotel! My room is excellent w/ a great view of the Gateway. A lovely breakfast by the pool, and casual moments in the Harbour Bar. Definitely choose a room in the original hotel rather than the Tower."
"THE TAJ! This is the Best Hotel in India According to me. I Loved the Stay here. The Staff , The Crowd , The Ambience, Is Perfect. everything seems to blend in perfectly. If you're in a sad mood...All You need to do is just open Your Window, and Enjoy the cool breeze and the silent sound of waves which comes...its ecstatic.:)"
"Awe Inspiring.  Loved it.  Went here on a private tour and experienced it along with the other Sites of Mumbai.  Only visited the hotels interior and exterior to see what we saw on the TV in the UK and was overly impressed.... When I win the Lottery, I will return to this hotel, or maybe in a few years time.  Either way, would love to spend just a night or two here at some point in my lifetime to experience it."
"A three night stay in the palace wing before heading off to Goa. Wonderful staff, lovely atmosphere, great pool area. Restaurants and bars good, breakfast excellent. Very atmospheric - it's worth paying the extra to stay in the palace wing rather than the tower. Not perfect, but it wouldn't be quite as charming if it were. They gave us a late check out on the day we were leaving. Apollo Blunder is a great part of Mumbai, close to Marine Drive, lots of places to eat/drink, and the train station.  The only negative thing to report is our dealing with the front desk. We were on the wait list for the overnight train to Goa, so we weren't certain that we would be on the train. They offered to keep checking on our behalf and let us know when the roster for the train was produced late"
"It is a very good hotel, where we can stay stay and entertain all the time. There is no restriction on any activities. The atmosphere in the hotel is also fantastic. The area also very suitable for stay."
"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Taj for our first couple nights in India. It was an excellent way to relax and settle into our trip. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was immaculate, the breakfast buffet is out of this world, and the pool/courtyard area is stunning. If you don't mind splurging, this place will not disappoint!"
"MY wife had wanted to stay at this hotel since she first saw it many years ago and I thought for our 25th anniversary I would book us a room in the Palace wing and opted for the Club rooms with a sea view.  The quality service started long before we booked in as the Taj staff were simply amazing at providing help and information by email, important to me as I wanted to make sure everything was perfect before we arrived.  When we arrived we were met by the hotel chauffeur, having prearranged the complimentary airport collection, and he provided a very informative journey to the hotel.  At the hotel as soon as the chauffeur opened the door we were greeted by name by a member of staff who took us inside gave us a blessing and presented us with garlands.  She then took us up to our"
"Always a pleasure to stay here. The service, food and location are all first class. One of the top hotels I have stayed at and can't wait to come back. Sea lounge service excellent and the transfer service to the airport is great - the drivers always willing to take you off the main route to show you some of the sites. A fascinating and unique location. "
"Stayed at The Taj Mahal Palace for one night with my family in Mar'15. It is truly an institution to experience....a ""to do"" once in your lifetime. Excellent location in the heart of old Mumbai and they make every guest feel really special. My daughter was presented with some soft toys & puzzles for our stay which made her day. The breakfast was amazing and rooms quite well kept.  The only negative was that work is being done on the exterior of the tower and the noise (drilling & hammering sounds) during the day is quite annoying. Doesn't give you a chance for a quiet afternoon nap."
"I love this hotel. One of my favorites. Stayed there for 6 nights on a business/personal trip in the new wing. An excellent deluxe room on the 17th floor. The room was spotless, the bed comfortable, room service great and fast. I've stayed there before, and will gladly do so again in the future!"
"We were lucky enough to stay in an ocean view room in the beautiful old palace wing, and loved every second. The rooms are very comfortable, and watching the sun rise over the Gateway and harbor is fabulous. There's something deeply cool about the Taj--we've stayed in grander and much older properties and yet never had the same sense of absolute well-being.   Part of it is the staff. They were all terrific, but I have to particularly mention Priyanka, one of the managers, and Margaret and Moiz in the salon, and the travel desk staff. We loved using the dramatic staircase instead of the lift in order to get a little exercise in--much nicer than the usual dingy stairwell. We also enjoyed one of the guest 'perks,' a very entertaining tour of the old part of the hotel; and we could"
"This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at!  A true 5 star hotel located next to ""The Gateway of India"", with a beautiful view over the ocean. It has the new and old divisions. I stayed at the old and had a feeling of being royal :-) I was backpacking around India and despite that I had to try Taj when I was in Mumbai. I don't regret a second! I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world. The service level of the staff is like nothing else. My contact there (sorry, don´t remember your name..) even gave me 2 books about places he recommended in India. The room was big and very clean and comfy, with a balcony towards the Gateway. Each morning there was a new ""treat"" in the bathroom, for the bath or your well being. I usually seek the neighbours for local food, but had to"
"We spent four nights here. We stayed in the less expensive but delux room with view of the sea and Gateway to Indis. It is in a great location for sight seeing, the travel desk was very helpful. As we were staying over a weekend we had the Sunday brunch which was well presented with lots of tasty dishes to choose from. All the staff were fantastic, nothing was to much trouble."
"I stayed in the Taj Hotel for 2 nights on an official trip and it was an awesome experience. The service was good and the food was superb. It was very pleasant, the staff were excellent and it is a great location with the oceanic beauty.  Great place to stay,"
"The New Tower is very compact. Small rooms not adequate amenities, nothing special. Not worth to stay for a business travel on solo visit except you are too scared to stay elsewhere or suffering from five Star affection only. "
Had a good stay at the hotel in the month of september. Royal treatment. rooms were fine as a palace. name gives it everything. opposite to gateway of india in the south bombay. great locality. must try for all touristers.
This was our first time and we stayed in the palace wing. What an experience. Service excellent. We had a room overlooking the sea and the Gateway.  Food was good especially the breakfast buffet - the choice was endless. Would definitely recommend you stay here if you get the chance
"This is a beautiful hotel... Amazing service provided by taj where one can complain... The hotel is divided into 2 wings the old wing and the new tower.. The old wing is where one should stay for a feel of the old taj and heritage. Sea lounge has an amazing high tea which one should try at least once as the ambiance with the food coupled together makes the experience amazing. They have multiple restaurants to try wasabi, golden dragon and the famous zodiac grill which one of the top restaurant in India"
"Stayed in the taj for 3 night. Great place to stay .  Take up the room with breakfast as their buffet is delicious, make sure you enjoy it outside and not in the restaurant.  Choose the old palace and not the new building. We were initially checked into a room in the new hotel extension close to the lift and with an adjoining room. We asked to be moved and the on call manager ( Priyanka- thank you ) moved us to the older building. A much grander and truer to the history of the Taj. So if there is an availability stay in the old building.   Staff were always helpful and friendly from  the security guards, cleaning staff, porters. All bar non were excellent    Great location, if you can get a sea view then you can get some pretty shots of the Gate of India, otherwise just cross"
we had been traveling around India for 7 weeks sleeping here there and every where some nice some not so nice but they were clean. So on the last leg of our journey we thought we would treat ourselfs to a bit of comfort by staying in the Taj Palace in Mumbia it was sheer bliss the service could not have been better. We only stayed 2 nights but we will go back...
"It's becoming almost cliche but we were inspired to visit India after watching the BBC documentary about this hotel.  Of course, we couldn't travel to India just to stay in Mumbai so factored in a couple of other places to explore, but started out here.  We had booked a Taj car to collect us from the airport and it was seamless.  They waited patiently for us to secure rupees beore leaving the airport and were happy for us to take our time to collect our thoughts (smoke a cigarette) before taking to the road.  Our booking involved securing the cheapest rooms available in order that we could splurge a bit in the restaurants and bars of the hotels.  We were in a fairly basic room in the Tower Wing but it was wonderful.  The bed was comfortable and the facilties more than adequate. "
"Went their for a tea but all the ambiance and hospitality is just out of the world. From the style, architecture, staff and cuisine all, everything was just brilliant. And the view of Gate of India is also breath taking."
"A true delight that exceeded the billing in a recent BBC TV series - the style, architecture, staff and cuisine all, with the exception of the pool bar staff who seemed adept at ignoring guests, absolutely top class.  Highly recommend the hotel tour that takes place daily at 5pm and most especially Masala Kraft - never had such good indian food..  As I was topping up my wife's water glass at dinner the waiter swiftly intervened saying ""please give me the pleasure of serving your wife""  Sums up the customer is first ethos Wholeheartedly recommended especially if budget permits a stay in the Palace Wing on a Taj Club basis - it IS worth every rupee"
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Place for three nights February 10-13, 2015. We check-in around midnight in Tower wing sea facing room. We was disappointed to experience this low quality room in Taj. all night could`t sleep due to musty smell and uncomfortable bed. We complain about room and asked for check-out. Hotel staff apologized and they upgrade our room to Place wing (R.No.604) at no extra cost. Place wing room was iconic, super luxurious with every comfort, we really enjoy our stay in place wing.   Nice breakfast buffet but overcrowded, need to wait 5-10 min which is fine. The most surprising part- if you are not foreigner and ask to sit in garden and terrace area (exclusively for the use of residential guests) for breakfast hotel waiter might tell you sorry all seats are"
"We are not Taj wealthy -- I doubt we'll ever stay in a hotel like this again -- but I booked one night as a special gift to my husband at the start of our 3 week India trip. I am so glad I did! We were treated like royalty from the minute we arrived. The service was impeccable.  I had read reviews on Trip Advisor so avoided the tower and splurged instead on the Palace Wing. Again, no regrets... not least because we were upgraded to a suite (!) The suite we ended up in was insane: three floors (if you count the gorgeous 2nd bathroom up in the eaves), a dining room, library, living room, huge loft bedroom and kitchen. We enjoyed every single second of our stay from the first cup of tea to the cold plunge in the lovely outdoor pool to the evening cocktails. Oh and breakfast?"
"Stayed for 4 nights in Feb at the start of our 3 weeks in India. This was our first time in Mumbai having been to India on 4 previous occasions.  Arranged to be collected from the airport by hotel driver. Mistake no 1. The price was 5 times what a regular A/C taxi will charge if booked at the airport.  Check in at the hotel was casual and informal, unlike previous contributors experience. The citrus smell at the reception area was somewhat overwhelming. No garland or cool drinks. Room was fine with a small balcony overlooking The Gateway of India. We were staying at The Tower.  Hotel had decorated the room with thoughtful pride to acknowledge a celebration. Also, the staff put fresh flowers in the room and brought some cake. Very welcome and very thoughtful gestures. Thank you"
"Excellent Hotel Property & Excellent Staff very courteous - The Hotel is very Plush, very clean & tidy, delicious food. The staff at Taj Mumbai are very courteous and make YOU feel like a KING. I shall always revisit the TAJ at .MUMBAI   A 7 star Experience"
"Staying in The Taj Mahal Palace is a dream come true for every Indian who grew up in India in the 80's.   I am a Taj loyalist. And even within all the Taj properties, this is the crown jewel (staying in the suites of the palace wing).   I had booked myself for two nights at the hotel on a March weekend. I was traveling with my wife & toddler daughter. On arrival, we were first hosted at the palace lounge (exclusive lounge for guests staying at Palace Wing), while the attendant got our stay formalities completed. We proceeded to our suite on the 5th Floor facing the swimming pool. The suite was huge, with a dining area, living room with TV, small working place, a huge bedroom & an even bigger bath area (with a huge bath tub at the centre) & an adjacent small room for shower. In a"
"I stayed at the Tower wing for 3 months back in 2009. Never understood what the hype is all about for this place. Rooms are small and due for major refurbishment; stale smell everywhere. Only commendable thing is the service here which I would give 5 star. Then again, wouldn't you expect good service from a supposedly ""6-star"" establishment??"
"We save the best (or so we thought) for last as Mumbai was our last stop of our six cities India vacation adventure. It was not difficult for us to decide which hotel to stay while in Mumbai but our faith with Taj Mahal Palace was tested right from the start.  Upon arrival, our luggage was removed for security screening and we were given a baggage tag for it.  After the check in formality was done, we gave them the baggage tag so that it can be brought up to our room.  We were tired and exhausted after a 12 hours train ride and we wanted a shower badly and to proceed down to have our dinner. We waited and waited for almost an hour for our luggage to be delivered and in the end I had to call up the front desk to inquire. It seems that they were trying to trace the owner of my"
"Perfection! Can’t imagine a better hotel  My high expectations of this hotel were far exceeded. Although the beautiful, historic building itself deserves much attention, it is the service that needs top billing. Maximum comfort, convenience and good spirits were clearly the aim of everyone on staff (without exception). They all deserve much credit, as I know tourists from so many different countries with so many different needs have to be a trying clientele.    Some of the positives include good size rooms, very comfortable, large bed, really good shower and overall bathroom setup, good wi fi (free and, unusually, for up to three devices at a time), and built in adapters. Other plusses  -	very nice fitness center and spa  -	Outstanding buffet breakfast! Best I had throughout my"
"We arrived here for 4 nights stay, after a week travelling by train from Delhi visiting most wonderful sights. We were very early arriving but they were able to escort us to out room in the old building within 15 minutes so we were very pleased and very happy with our beautiful room 351 overlooking the gate of India. The room was super, lovely big bed and bathroom, plenty of wardrobe storage and ample complimentary water.  The little seating area is delightful and we were pleased we were not any higher as we could see all the 'goings on' below, plus we could walk up and down the beautiful staircase!  We arrived on Saturday 14th Feb, Valentines day and were told that it would be busy and it was, very.  There was a big 2 day wedding function and this had an effect on the service"
"We had afternoon tea here overlooking the Gateway to India and the ocean. A wonderful experience and the food was plentiful and varied. A buffet offered you examples of savoury street food, followed by a tiered stand of sandwiches, cakes and scones. Back to the buffet for an extraordinary range of cakes, chocolates and other sweet treats. Plus any number of different teas and coffees. At an extremely reasonable price (currently about £15 a head) this meal will last you all day and evening. Service was impeccable and the setting exceptional."
"Peace full, Best Location, Worth to stay there. Rooms are good, food is excellent, in all the manner it is worth to stay there. View is excellent, Sea view rooms are available at very normal cost and it is worth to stay."
"This places is the finest, best for business meetings and lunches, the ambience is really good and the architecture is breathtaking, not to mention the fine service by Taj group, always a delight to be here.."
"The Taj Palace is an institution.  With amazing service and attention to detail, you will feel spoiled staying here.  Located on the southern tip of Mumbai, the Taj has great environment around it - especially good restaurants within walking distance.  The challenge is that it is removed from the vast majority of the city and to get around can be a long adventure.  While at the Taj, enjoy the pool and would highly recommend a massage at the Jiva Spa.  A great start to your day should include breakfast overlooking the Gateway of India at the Sea Lounge (which also has traditional tea service in the afternoon).  Enjoy!"
"Something comes over you the moment you step inside. The Taj Mahal Palace is certainly gracefully designed.  But it is the staff who make this hotel shine.  They anticipate your needs. They are consistently warm and pleasant.  They have good advice for getting around a congested city that can be filthy and bewildering at times--yet also beautiful and welcoming.    I stayed at this hotel during my birthday and was away from my family.  The staff prepared a cake, and left flowers, balloons and a card for me.  It made my day feel special.  And apparently they did it because they saw my birthdate on the registration information and realized I was away from home for a long trip....that's all.  Huge wow!  On top of many other wows.  What an amazing luxury hotel.  Can't wait to return."
"Our stay was over the valentines weekend. It was fabulous. Attentive staff, superb tasty breakfast buffet and beautiful rooms. We had dinner in one of the hotel restaurants. They are abit pricey, quality of food ok. Overall a very impressive hotel and hope to visit again. Also caught a glimpse of Liz Hurley residing at same time!"
"We stayed as part of our ""Taj Tour"" and this was the best of the hotel group. However as part of a tour group we did feel the hotel had cut back a little which was a shame as the standards portrayed in the recent BBC Tv program were not quite met...very good in spite of this. Since the ""trouble"" all the entrances have been closed except the Annex entrance which is like any other first class but modern hotel lobby. A shame. Our room however had a most impressive view of the Gateway to India. The sunset and sunrise will stay with me forever"
"a truly memorable stay in a wonderful hotel. The staff are both friendly, helpful and will go the extra mile to assist. Eating is a bit on the pricey side but the menu's are varied and at least one meal in wont break the bank too much. Ask for a room overlooking the beach as this also should provide a view of the famed gateway to India.   If flying anywhere by Air India do not trust the information boards. Ever, it will cost you if you do"
"We stayed here for 3 days.What a splendid hotel with exquisite service.We stayed in the palace wing ,5th floor and sea facing room.Great views of Bombay harbor from our window.Could not have found a better place as it was in the town but still retained its regal and quiet and serene atmosphere .Everone was very friendly,Perfect in service and you felt as part of the hotel.Very nice breakfast and great restaurants.One aspect which can be improved id the free wi fi.For such a royal hotel it would be better to offer impeccable free Wi Fi with faster speed etc."
"What can I say, I have never experienced anything like this hotel, I've stayed in supposedly 5 star hotels around the world, nothing can touch the Taj, from start to finish it was an amazing experience, we had had a nightmare start with our flights(that's another story altogether) and when we checked in we were a bit fraught, the lady at reception was amazing, we were upgraded to the palace wing and again WOW, rooms are beautiful, service is second to none, breakfast out of this world, also a huge thank you to Denesh at the concierge desk for taking 2 days locating our luggage as Air France had lost it, I'm intending to go back to the Taj next year for a wee bit longer holiday and taking my 2 boys so they can take in the whole experience that I had, thank you so much Taj Mahal"
"We stayed three nights before joining a tour of India. There is probably little I can say which has not been related many times before other than to repeat that this must be one of the premier hotels of the world. We went as a result of the BBC television documentary on the hotel and it certainly lived up to our expectations. We treated ourselves to club rooms and joined in the decadence of afternoon tea, then drinks and then cognac and chocolates and then the Harbour bar - and so to bed! It was lovely and the experience was simply fantastic - the striking décor, the immaculate service, the ambience, even the television in the middle of the large mirror in the bathroom (extraordinary). It was certainly expensive but it was well worth it."
"One will be wondering why did i put such a remark in the  tittle . Wait here it goes , but i would definitely put up good things up front :   Good Things :  1. Check in was smooth and we were upgraded to Palace rooms .  2. The rooms  did have all amenities and a very big bathroom which a shower and bath tub separately  3.  In room dinning was good and adhered to time .  4. Complimentary fruits on each day and gift on one of the day ( delighted my mom and wife ) . Also wifi was available  5. Personal care for arranging room while room service and turn down service . 6. Good shops at ground level . 7 . Wonder full Japanese Resrnt Wasabi specially the sushi roll and the Champagne ice cream compote .   Not So good things :   Having stayed at Taj Vivanta hotels across India , i"
"One could not ask for a more first-class experience. The fact that you can get a personal trainer in the spa for no additional cost is a luxury beyond belief.  The service is beyond helpful.  Really. Sometimes, you almost have to tell them to back off.  It is expensive, but worth every penny.  Pay attention to all the things that are included, like 24-hour coffee and tea service in the lounge and you will feel you did very well by your expense."
"We were upgraded to the Palace wing and it was outstanding from our bell boy to our butler to the room boy, the service was outstanding, a truly amazing experience, this beautiful historic hotel is breathtaking, we shall try and return next year when we return to India on our annual visit."
"Having stayed at the Taj Lake Palace and the Vivanta by Taj at Kololam as well as watching the BBC's Hotel India I was very excited to stay at the Taj in Mumbai, however it didn't quite meet my expectations in a few areas.   Having stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world our room in the Taj Tower didn't hit the mark for a 5 star flagship hotel. The room 604 was a superior sea view but in my opinion it wasn't a superior room - it had a great view but the room was on the plus side was freshly painted as I could still smell paint but the furnishings were a little distressed and rather plain without much luxury, style or glamour. The bathroom was small and rather dated from the 1970s.   Our welcome was a little lacking in the personal approach of other Taj hotels no cold"
"Since childhood i had a dream to stay at-least  once in this beautiful historic palace. And finally it came true when we decided to stay there on our first wedding anniversary. My wife was very exited with this idea and boy Taj made our visit memorable one. Movement you enter you are greeted with smile , the lavish ambiance make you feel like king with real jewels crafted on the floors and amazing tasty food choices they have make your taste buds happy. Upgrade to Heritage wing made our day special (it was a different world altogether), and a heritage  tour in the evening really make you treasure the whole experience and make you feel part of the history attached to this place. I am definitely planning my next visit with my family to  experience this lavish ,kind hospitality."
"Every thing is fine and They upgrade me from the tower room to palace room and this include evening tea and coffee, beers, snacks, liquor and chocolate all for free.In addition if you forget something in your room they will send it to you anywhere in the world for free. Great service but the price is high"
"well what can I say about this hotel we stay here on the last leg of our journey for a couple of days and found this hotel to be really nice and the service was very good as I do like good hotels of this quality, I found the service to be out standing and the staff polite as for the honesty section this was outstanding , I lost my bum bag well I through I lost it at one of the shops that we was shopping in, we went through security at the hotel , got to the room etc and about after 5 min found that that I did not have my bum bag , well you can imagine how I felt sick in side and then started to get angry with my self because I never take out that much money at any one time, I had over £1800 in pounds and about £70 in rupees and to top it all a money clip that my wife got me for"
"The Taj is not a hotel, it is a dream of what the world can be at its very best! The privilege of staying in this stunning landmark and wandering through its beautiful halls, salons, and gardens is beyond any price. The staff are truly family welcoming you to their home- I have stayed in deluxe hotels around the world and no place has enchanted me so very much. We were not simply served, we were truly taken care of and pampered by the staff who managed to be incredibly attentive and caring without ever being obsequious. Their love for the guests is entirely genuine. This hotel could only exist in Indian culture. We knew the name of several staff members- at breakfast the marvelous steward Dinesh made a special masala chai for me in the kitchen every morning, and also brought"
"Just frankly, staying at the Taj is not at all a lost investment. The location is superb and most importantly when you cross the door you suddenly feel taken care of.   Loved the place. It's been my third time.   The rooms are priced very well. The restaurants are a bit pricy but that's a choice you make.   They need some fine tuning here and there but overall it a nice stay.   It's unfortunate though that the security level has made the hotel lose some of its charm, but after what they went through, I would not trade the security for anything on earth."
"We, 2 couples, spent 2 nights at the TaJ Mahal Palace at the end of a wonderful 18 day tour of Rajasthan. Most of our accommodation had, at our request, been in Homestays or 'quirky' properties, but we specified the Taj following the TV programme to coincide with my wife's birthday and the end of our tour. Although we stayed in the new wing the rooms were tremendous with a lovely view over the harbour and the 'Gateway to India'. The rooms were more than big enough for us with a large and very comfortable bed, comfortable seating area with a large desk and a more than adequate en suite with a bath and shower. The facilities in the hotel are truly amazing with several restaurants to choose from, a lovely pool area and the friendliest and most helpful staff you could possibly"
What words could describe this hotel. From arrival to our stay and departure the hotel offers 10 star treatment. Breakfast was fantastic. Rooms were clean and so much attention to detail was given by staff.location was excellent and everything from food to shopping is in walking distance. taj mahal palace is one experience everyone should have when going to mumbai .will definitely go back
"Absolutely wonderful, the ultimate place to stay in India. Perfectly located, stunningly beautiful, smells gorgeous, amazing breakfast, great pool, 14 restaurants, super staff, big rooms, lovely shower, very comfy bed and yummy bed sheets, I LOVED it."
"Not a lot that can be said as this hotel for us was just perfect.  We were treated with an upgrade from the Tower to the West Palace Wing, our room was large, clean and with a fantastic view of the Gateway to India and the sea."
"We stayed for three nights in the Tower Wing.  The first thing which hits you when you the hotel is the quiet beauty of the vast reception area with its huge beautiful flower display.  Check in was quick, the staff efficient and pleasant.  We were escorted to our room on the 14th floor which was facing the sea.  Tea and cookies were served in our room (we later found this was complimentary). The room was spacious and elegant.  The bed and pillows extremely comfortable.  The room had a narrow balcony with netting to keep pigeons out but they had placed small chairs out with a bowl of roses so we could sit and look out over the Gate of India which is a constant draw when in the room.  There was some noise from a television in the room next door and from someone talking loudly on a"
"After 12 days in a Homestay in Kerala decided to splash out my last night in Mumbai at this iconic hotel. Everything from arrival reception onwards was a pure delight, amazing staff that attended to your every need in a professional yet unobtrusive manner, stunning rooms in a beautiful location, if you get the chance don't even think just book."
"We spent 3 nights here after watching the documentary about the hotel. The building and the location is stunning and you cannot wish for anything better than the Taj. Staff is welcoming, polite and very helpful. All facilities, rooms are impeccably clean, complimentary toiletries provided. Room is cleaned every day, clean towels provided. At breakfast you have ample choice of fruit, cheese, cold meats, bread, eggs and many other items including traditional indian dishes. The Sea lounge offers High tea package every day between 3pm and 7pm which is excellent value for money (1500 INR per person includes tea coffee and buffet with excellent choice of street style indian food, traditional sandwiches and delicacies). No booking required, just walk in."
"Great location and service, got upgraded to a palace room so very pleased. Hotel pool area is beautiful, after travelling around Mumbai it's great to relax and have a swim in great surrounding. Hope to stay again."
My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Taj Palace. It really is what it claims to be. Service at its best and the staff were always willing to help and found them to be very courteous at all times. Very busy though at all times and can be a bit noisy during the many weddings that are held there but then they are so colourful and lively.
"This is a very comfortable and clean hotel to stay in. The staff are very kind and helpful. The rooms are airy and bright although a bit tight. The pool is well maintained and the outdoor patio leading to the pool is pleasant to sit and have a cup of tea. There are the unavoidable pigeons that come to drink at the fountain near the outdoor patio, they can be annoying but one way to reduce their numbers is to remove the fountain. The location is great! Colaba is a great place to find good restaurants and shopping. The hotel faces the Gateway of India, a nostalgic sight in the mornings if you are lucky to see the sun rise from the breakfast room. And a great assortment of continental and Indian breakfast."
"Everyone has heard of the Taj in Mumbai and it lives up to its name.  The hotel and service are almost perfect in every way. Nothing is too much trouble for them and they go out of their way with the special details to make sure your stay is as memorable as the hotel itself.  This is a city hotel, so don't expect acres of green open space, but the gardens and pool area are nice.  Because the hotel is so famous it's always busy with tourists. However the pool area and anything above the first floor is off limit to anyone but guests so there are areas to escape to!  The Palace lounge is for guests in club taj rooms and suites and is a haven away from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai and the hotel. The waiters in the lounge are aways attentive and friendly. We quite often find"
"Amazing service at this historic, wonderful hotel. Only slight downside was the breakfast which didn't cater for my tastes. Apart from that I found this hotel to be faultless. The only place I would stay when I next visit Mumbai."
"I booked one night only and I had thought I will move to other hotels because I did not expect Indian Hotel but after staying one night, I decided to extend my stay.I enjoyed reading books and eating breakfast, lunch and dinner in front of pool. This hotel was amazing, not an Indian level."
"Where this hotel is located is in an amazing area with lots of great shopping within walking distance to the famous Colabar Street and plenty of eateries. My room was on the older wing, facing the Gate of India. Gorgeous view in the evening sunset."
It is by far the best hotel to be visited. The royal treatment along with the pleasant ambiance and the cordial staff makes up to the wonderful experience. The best part about this hotel is the view of the gateway of India is selected the correct room.
"This is a jewel in Mumbai. Great food. Great staff and fabulous rooms in the old wing.  Everybody have done reviews on Taj and the only aspect I can mention is the fantastic team of Concierges the hotel have. They are helpful, kind and very, very professional. Thank you Satish, Sandeep and Dinesh.You have solved all our problems and let us know better the city with advises and suggestions. A reference to the Kraft Massala with excellent food and staff. When in Mumbai stay in Taj and ask for a room turned to the sea facing the India Gateway. Goncalo and Mercia (Macau)"
"Was waiting from a long time to experience the services of this very famous hotel and now i can say with precise that yes it really worth the appraisal it has received all these years long.The service is just heart touching , each employee here is as courteous and knowledgeable as other. Its a completely different staying here and in other hotels, you feel connected to essence of India. Must stay place in Mumbai."
"A dear friend of ours recommended we start our month long visit to India by living firsthand the warmth and attention to detail omnipresent at the Mumbai Taj. Yes, this hotel sits in a privileged spot right next to the India Gate and ferries to Elephanta. Yes, it is a historical landmark which each and every employee at the Taj makes patently obvious. Yes, the accomodations are luxurious but not priced excessively. Yes, all of their restaurants cater to any whim the weary traveler may have. Many, many positives, yet the most outstanding feature is the personal attention, the warmth that exudes from every member of the staff that makes you feel welcome and in control of your World."
"On my return flight from Mumbai, I was able to watch the documentary set in the Taj Mahal Palace again (I had seen when it was first broadcast but it was interesting to watch having just stayed there).  The staff commented that their maxim is ""guest is God"" and I feel they live up to this... and more.  The hotel itself is beautiful and grand, as one would expect.  I was collected by a pre-arranged car from the airport and driven to the hotel with no disruption at all - seemless.  I was greeted upon arrival by a member of staff who seated me in the very comfortable lobby area whilst he arranged for all aspects of the check-in process to be completed.   This felt very restful and luxurious, particularly when he returned to tell me that we had been upgraded to a Palace room.  My"
"Having just had an absolutley perfect stay at the Vivanta Taj Malabar in Cochin I was really looking forward to our stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai as being the highlight of our India trip. In fairness the hotel is great and the majority of the staff are friendly and helpful but one unfortunate experience rather spoilt our whole stay. After a hot and stressful morning in Mumbai we returned to the hotel looking for some lunchtime refreshment, the hotel pool bar area was full so we were directed by staff to the only other bar in the hotel which is by the Wasabi restaurant. After being seated and given menus about five minutes later another member of staff approached us and asked us to leave the restaurant, a little surprised I asked why and he said that children are not"
"First trip to India and after visits to Aambay valley and Indore with work a couple of nights at the TMP before flying home. Met at airport by driver (costly 3500 rupee) and welcomed at hotel personally, hotel is so atmospheric you can feel the history. Lovely room overlooking the Gateway of India. Pool area is wonderful and good gym. Service fantastic throughout. Great breakfast choices. From what I can see many chain Mumbai hotels are near the airport that is a long way from the town. The TMP is in the hub of things close to some great bars (Leopold ,Mondegar) and has a great atmosphere on the streets outside. Good happy hour in the hotel also. Only downside was the noise from the TV next door which seemed to be on most of the night at high volume. Not sure if this was due to"
"No doubt if I was her discovering India in a slow and time consuming manner this might have been fabulous. However I was not. The building works obviously not advertised on there web site are disingenuous. I needed to sleep in the afternoon (BA flight arrives at around 2am) but the drilling and knocking was problematic. I called for a solution they offered an investigation. I eventually moved to the palace. The slow oldy worldy charm came with sloppy service. Minor things safe locked so I had to carry my passport and money with me, tea in the morning with lemon - fully charged for - came without the lemon. Breakfast at the new part does not have the great view of the sea room but better selection and you make your own toast, unlike the Sea room where you can chose from cold"
"I have stayed in lots of hotels around the world, And i can't wait to stay at the taj again .The service was out of this world. I'm already planning my next visit but will stay there for much longer. The staff made my stay so perfect. Loved the place lounge Devendra is a assert  to the hotel he made my family,s stay such a pleasure. All the staff are wonderful and couldn't do enough for us."
Its one of the best hotel I have been to till date. It provides you not only the luxury but that Royal touch which makes you feel like a king or somthing. Will give average rating to the food but for stay its really worth.
"I have stayed in many great hotels in the world, but this one was always high on my 'must stay' list, and we were not disappointed in any way.  Very hard to describe fully the opulent, colonial grandeur at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, truly a unique and special place. It is like stepping back in time at a luxury hotel but with up to date 5* service. We were lucky enough to be in a club room in The Palace Wing, and I would find it hard to fault anything at all.  The room was lovely, decorated with balloons on arrival as it was our anniversary and various different choices of bath 'smellies' which I took full advantage of! The butlers are simply amazing, nothing is too much trouble and they really are ahead of your every wish.... know exactly what a guest wants before being asked. "
"First trip to india and chose to stay at Taj Mahal and there was no regrets. It was a wonderful experience. Loved the room. They provided kids bathtub and johnsons products with soft toys, colouring books and also jigsaw puzzles. The service is superb and the breakfast is really yummy. Love the thosai on demand and the masala omelettes. There is even a history walking tour every evening. Have breakfast by the pool with the birds flying around. "
"We stopped here just for the high tea in the sun lounge. It was like a posh London afternoon tea with the perks of yummy indian snacks like vada pau, pani puri etc as well! Absolutely amazing and will definitely go back! The hotel itself is very high class but we didn't stay here "
Have  been  staying in  Taj palace since 1991 It is located near the Gate way of India. An architect marvel standing there for more than 100 yrs overlooking the vast arabian  sea giving commanding view of the sea. An iconic structure vibrant and full of international celebrities all round the year. It has stood the test of time and stand  as reflection of greatness  and vision of the people  who planned such  magnificent structure so lomg  ago. It is treat  to be in  the building  it  self. one  can adore  it from  out side and then from  inside. The staff is not only courteous but very  help ful. The linen is well maintained  so is the crockery  and  cutlery used immaculate and good  quality . Has wonderful lobby with some nice seating areas with nicely  made sofas and chairs
"This is the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in. I felt homesick after leaving! Make sure you take the guided tour offered daily by Viren, it is very interesting to learn more about the history of this exquisite place."
"We had an overnight stay in the Palace wing at the end of a three week trip around India-it is a fabulous building which didn't disappoint. The Gateway to India outside is less attractive as there are lots of street hawkers and an absolute mass of pigeons around so, having ventured out briefly, returned to enjoy the comforts of the hotel very quickly! We ate in the Indian restaurant as we felt this was likely to be a good place to enjoy Indian food but we're disappointed with our fish curry, broccoli and vegetable curry dishes which just lacked flavour. Breakfast is good but not exceptional by international hotel standards and we had a 15 minute wait for an omelette. Overall an iconic and great place to stay in Mumbai."
"After watching BBC programme and always wanting to visit India, thought this would be a good place to start. What can I say...it was the most amazing experience! We were upgraded to Taj Club and had a beautiful room overlooking sea and Gateway to India. Our room was kept spotlessly clean everyday.  But the best part of being upgraded was use of the Palace Lounge. I have never been so spoilt!! Devendra & Pranit looked after us so well. They were so kind and made us feel very special. I can't thank them enough, especially Devendra, who made our last evening there extra special! The historical tour is well worth doing as the hotel is steeped in history.  I would highly recommend staying at this beautiful hotel. "
My stay at this hotel was marvellous... I was very happy with the service and food quality and also the hotel activities.. It a really good place to stay if u wanna enjoy your vacation at the pinnacle..
"What a stunning hotel this is, both in atmosphere, food, staff and position.   My wife and I visited for a 4 day stay on our very first visit to India.   We arrived in the very early hours of the morning and were greeted as though we were royalty.   The staff were consistently polite in all aspects of the hotel whether in restaurants, front of house or security.   The breakfasts were absolutely wonderful, a great selection of fresh fruit, pastries and hot or cold food.   Nothing was too much, for any staff member, we only had to ask and it was there.     The position of the hotel is ideal, only a short walk from both the 'Gate of India', and wonderful restaurants just around the corner.   The Taj really is a wonderful hotel and one which if we found ourselves back in Mumbai"
"After staying there, I think is diff to stay elsewhere. The hotel is soooo beautiful especially by the pool area. I feel like I was staying at some palace when I walk out to the pool area. Totally charming. The room is big and bed is super comfy. The place is just in front of gateway east and walking distance to one of the museum as well. Great location ."
"After a wonderful stay at the Taj Rambagh Palace Hotel, we were hoping for a similar experience here, but sadly this was not to be. We had a nice club room on the 5th floor of the palace wing which had great views over the Gateway to India. The room was comfortable and well appointed and the service from the housekeeping team was excellent. The area where we felt disappointed and somewhat let down was the Sea lounge where we breakfasted on both mornings of our stay. Both mornings we were given water from a Himalayan brand bottle which was not bottled water, it had a distinct unpleasant taste to it. Upon asking a member of the waiting staff if it was tap water we were told that the hotels water is three times filtered and ok to drink, we told,him that for us this was not"
"After watching ""Hotel India"" on the BBC and knowing its reputation, we decided to change our hotel from The Oberoi in Mumbai to this. Our rooms were in the Tower did not live up to the meticulous scrutiny that we had expected and seen on the recent documentary. The rooms were ok but a little tired, the balconies were dirty and had to be cleaned after complaining. The buffet breakfast was excellent in terms of its choice of foods but the service appeared disorganised, surprising given the large number of staff. A pot of tea took three or four requests from various waiters before we received it. We ate at the Japanese, the Lebanese and by the pool and these were good, especially the Japanese.  The pool area was excellent and the Spa was superb. Ofcourse the hotel's position is"
"As always we ended  our recent 4 wk trip to India by spending the last 5 nights at The Taj Palace Mumbai. We had the executive suite in the Palace wing...and it was indeed a beautiful suite, the only thing it lacked was the sea view but the quality of everything else around us including the excellent butler service made us soon forget about the sea view. This ofcourse came with the Club floor facilities and I have to say the staff & service in the club lounge was great.From airport pick up till we left everything was simply superb.Plenty of staff by the pool side all day and service was super efficient. Enjoyed our dinner in The Golden Dragon.Had the Lobster with Singaporean chilli sauce and dimsums....really yumm.The rooms in the tower wing are smaller but if with sea view they"
"Spent our first four nights in India at the Taj.  Hotel staff were very pleasant, professional and helpful. The restaurants are exceptional, tried several of them. Our room was very clean, marble bathtub, seperate shower. Security is very tight at the entrance, we never felt insecure. In fact , we stayed at the Taj hotels in Aurangabad and Peniji in Goa, tight security at all of them. Would definately stay at he Taj Palace again."
"We stayed in the Tower Wing and had an amazing view of the Gateway of India. The room was well furnished and house keeping maintained the room exceptionally throughout our stay. The daily buffet breakfast had a large variety, that was continually stocked. The pool and verandah are truly an oasis. We dined at many restaurants in the hotel and were extremely happy with the food and service. If it's available, go on the hotel tour - it's very informative and gives a great overview of the hotels history! The hotel location is perfect - right in the heart of Mumbai. Walking distance to many attractions. We wouldn't consider staying anywhere else when in Mumbai! "
"We booked a club level room which included a pick-up from Mumbai's airport.  We were handled professionally from the start and were welcomed with cool elegance in the lobby of the Palace portion of the first floor.  Tower guests check in in a larger more rambunctious lobby.   ""Because this is your first time with us, we have upgraded you to a suite.""  Who cares what the real reason was, but they gave us the Bell Tower Suite on the top floor of the Palace wing. Wow.  A dining room with a table for 10.  A duplex accomodation with a study, bathroom, dining room, and living room on the first floor and a sleeping loft, dressing room, and major bathroom above.   Wood paneled throughout and a huge wood-beamed domed ceiling.   A corner view onto the sea.  Completely silent and totally"
"Take the Rooms in the Heritage Wing of the Hotel facing the Sea is better, We had a suit in the heritage wing, they offered us ( at no extra cost included in our stay)  high tea (with snacks) followed by a herritage tour of the hotel (interesting hotel history), thereafter followed by  unlimited cokctails in the evening and then a cognac and choclate tasting 9. 30 pm onwards thus we were almost full with not much hunger for dinner, this way you stay within the hotel with enough activities no need to venture out ; excellent  room service they filled up the tub with warm water and rose petals after our long heritage walk making it super soothing and romantic !! The Spa treatment (involving deep tissue massage) was out absolutely wonderful! The beffet breakfast by the sea int he"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is of course the most well known hotel in Mumbai. Located right opposite the Gateway of India, the hotel is luxurious, service is good and the rooms are fantastic.I stayed here for 3 nights in Jan 2015 and though I was on work and did not spend much time in the room it was still a great experience. It's location in Colaba is walking distance from a number of good bars, restaurants and landmarks. The food in the hotel while pretty decent is of course exorbitantly priced. The buffet breakfast is a little limited and the hotel is quite big, which means you could have a long walk to your room. The gym is well equipped but is laid out in a very weird fashion and is consists of a number of narrow interconnected rooms. The gym also tends to get very crowded and can"
"Absolutely stunning experience! The Taj Mahal Palace has the best hotel service in India. The Poolside is a truly oasis in the heart of Mumbai. Reception, travel desk, concierge, room service and staff are very kind and helpful."
"We stayed in the old ""palace"" wing.  The only thing old about it is the appearance.  Everything is newly done, crisp and gorgeous, with the physical aspect of old India.  I truly recommend staying in that wing.  We had a room overlooking the sea.  Waking up early and opening the curtains is totally amazing: people, boats, the Gate of India and birds.  It's a fascinating site!  Service is beyond excellent.  We had breakfasts and a light early dinner at the hotel and it was prepared perfectly.  Location is great too!"
"We decided to treat ourselves to one night at the Taj and although we did have a wonderful time it were a few issues slightly spoiling our experience. But the best first. We visited the Shiva spa and I had the best massage I have ever had from a lady called Jenifer. It was delightful.  We had the cheaper option of a room in the tower. Wonderful comfortable bed. Room service also good, very attentive staff. But the food, although tasty, was cold! We also ordered a DVD from the library. It transpired we had no player, then we realised we'd been given the wrong film! Slightly inefficient for such a prestigious hotel. We also found some of the staff poolside to be a tad rude/indifferent. Finally breakfast! What a spread, fantastic food. BUT we had to stand outside for 15 minutes"
"Very very beautiful hotel, inside and outside, clearly one of the best hotels that we stayed in. Our room was overlooking the Gateway of India, with great scenery. The whole place around the hotel was buzzing at night, and walking down the marina at night was fab. The hotel is very clean, with all facilities available. Food is excellent with wide variety of cuisines. Service was second to none. There is no need to call a lift, as there is someone waiting for you as you approach the lift, who calls the lift for you !!!"
"We stayed here at the end of a 2 week trip in India.. Loved the hotel.. Great service. Great restaurants, we had an Indian tasting menu with private chef at the hotel--very cool. Room was very nice with a great view of the Gate of India.. High tea was also very nice. Would come back in a heart beat"
"Everything you would expect of such a hotel, and situated right across the road from the Gateway to India.  Seems like there are more staff than guests. Everyone is so helpful and knowledgable.  Breakfast absolutely fantastic with the largest selection of fruit, and hot and cold meals that I have ever encountered.  Meals a little expensive but understandable in a hotel of this standard. Just part of the ambience.  My only quibble is the price of Kingfisher beer, which works out at over £10 per pint."
"I decided to visit this Iconic hotel for 'afternoon tea' with some friends whilst in Mumbai - what a waste of time and money. The Hotel itself is beautiful and well worth a look to see it but I really would not wish to return and now certainly would not consider staying here. Staff did not seem to know which restaurants were open or could provide drinks, we trekked around for 20minutes before finding somewhere willing to serve us and then dumped unceremoniously at a table near the buffet. The waiter we were assigned was grumpy and rude, he banged crockery on the table and did not make any attempt to either make sure we had all we needed or were satisfied at the end - all this at INR 400 for a cup of tea and the smallest biscuit I have seen in my life. I have been in many five"
"Taj Mahal Palace has a historic value in our lives as all the famous Indians or People from around the world have stayed in this Palace once while visiting Mumbai just reaching staying one feels connected to them the hospitality the food the view from Rooms of Gate Way of India all has its worth , the food at wasabi the live Band , truly worth many more times to go and stay"
"This is one of our favourite hotels. More staff than guests. With a man or woman for absolutely everything -luggage, laundry,ice,wine, drinks. All at your service. Take a chair by the pool under the old hotel and order a drink and feel a million.  Good location for wandering Colaba.  Right by the Gateway to India.  We did not eat in the hotel but simply walked to nearby restaurants which range from a few Rupees to a 4 star restaurant meal at half the hotel price.  Steeped in history  Fabulous.  Recommended."
"I am a frequent visitor to this wonderful and magnificent hotel - The Taj !!! It's in my hometown Mumbai and growing up it was always a dream to enter such a hotel. I used to frequent it as a child while my parents used to work in the same area Colaba. Now I do have the luxury to stay in the hotel and enjoy the luxury of this beautiful hotel. I would say having travelled the world , what made me write this review is the detailing of this hotel , pure class !! The flowers wherever you would spit them are real from orchids to tulips. Best and spacious rooms/ suites , great restaurants , it has a shopping strip inside the hotel which includes Louis Vuitton too. Ambience par excellence to hospitable service , I would clearly rate this as one of the best hotels I've ever been too."
We have just come back from a two night stay and i can honestly that it is the best five star hotel we have stayed in to date.  On arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was a wonderful start to our brief stay.  The hotel still has an elegant feel to it with understated but highly attentive service delivered by experienced professionals.  The staff gave gifts to our three year old daughter and also ensured that our room was decorated for valentines day with rose petals and a rose table display.  This was a lovely introduction to india-an oasis of calm in a sea of humanity. Full credit to the management for running such a wonderful establishment. 
"We enjoyed a night here on our way through Mumbai.   The hotel is well situated for the Gateway to India and the colonial style buildings in the area. The downside of this is that it can be quite a ride from the airport when the traffic is heavy (it took us over an hour to reach the hotel on the way to it).   The hotel itself is comfortable and well serviced. We wanted for nothing. The pool is lovely and big, and cold, a welcome reprieve from the hustle of the Mumbai city.   All of this comes at a price, of course, though you could do far worse than to enjoy a stay here. "
"The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is one of the world's very special grand hotels.  ""Iconic"" is a grotesquely over-used word, but it applies in this case.  Built by the British during the Raj, a genteel colonial ambience (in the best sense) lingers on. Today, the Taj is the flagship operation of an Indian hotel chain, and it is wonderfully run.  Service is as attentive as any we've ever experienced, without being overbearing.  Rooms are tasteful and spacious, in-house restaurants (Indian, Chinese, Lebanese) are outstanding.  The location is excellent.  In sum, if the Taj Mahal Palace is within your budget, you can't do better."
"A south Bombay girl , whose grown up by the sea... And can't get enough of the Arabian.... The husband knew of how much I romantisise the Taj Mahal Palace, so he booked us on a weekend in the club suite of Taj Mahal Palace . Was thrilled to bits with the surprise but apprehensive at the same time since I didn't want any experience to take away of what we South bomabyites feel for the Taj Palace  The thought of exploring your own backyard as a tourist was an exciting one .. And Taj didn't let us down. Right from the room. The welcome and the cuisine ... Delectable We were booked in club suite which gave us access to the club privileges which include high tea , breakfast and wine and dine were an experience which is a class apart  To sit by the club and watch the Arabian , the"
"We stayed here for a few days for my birthday,the staff were very at tentative and nothing was too much trouble.  On my birthday the room was full of heart shaped balloons, and rose petals I also had a bouquet of flowers and a cake."
"We stayed in the Presidential Suite the night of our grand wedding a few years ago. Woke up in the middle of the night to find cockroaches all over the bathroom floor. Called downstairs twice and about 20 minutes later (3:30am) a young gentleman came to ""spray the bathroom"". That's it. Dead roaches, no follow up, no apologies upon check-out. No allowance for a late check-out, either.   I am a Hilton Diamond, Starwood Platinum, and Marriott Rewards member...have never seen or witnessed anything like this. Will not return to Taj Mumbai for another stay."
"We booked this hotel after watching the documentary on tv . It looked cood and appealed to us. The documente Ary does not do it justice it is amazing, and the staff are fabulous , nothing was too much for them. We were up graded to a palace club room, and go the extra benifits that goes woth the room. Afternoon tea, cocktails and cognac and chocolates. Breakfast was amazing as was every aspect of The Taj."
"From the very first glimpse of The Taj I knew this was going to a stay of a lifetime.  Was it the magnificent lobby, the huge flower arrangements, the immaculate uniformed staff or just the incredible atmosphere that sucked me into the grandure if it all? I dont know, but whatever it was I was hooked from the moment I stepped out of the taxi.   The reception staff welcomed us as if we were long returning friends. The check in was efficient and all done with the upmost courtesy.  Our room was incredible,  from the views over the pool and beyond to the beautiful furniture and paintings.   We had High Tea in The Sea Lounge, as well as the buffet breakfasts. A tip if you are partaking in High Tea, dont make arrangements for dinner that night, its more than just a few sandwiches a"
"What a magnificent place to kick off our tour of the west and north of India. Our deluxe sea view room in the Palace wing looked out over the Gate of India and the bustling ferries to Elefanta Caves. The pool area was a haven from the hustle and bustle of surrounding street - though the constant sound of scooter, tuc tuc and car horns was a little intrusive! We tried several of the restaurants; all superb especially Masala Kraft. We could not fault the service."
"Well, I had always been to this hotel before for a nice dinner with my partner or just to catch up with a few friends over a drink. Being a member of the Taj Group, I thought of staying a night here just for a day's break from routine, I booked a suit for my partner and myself. Right from the moment I entered the reception, we could feel the warmth and hospitality from the staff. Surprise gifts from the house-keeping staff just added to the already awesome welcome we had. The rooms are so beautifully done and complimentary drink makes your day. The heritage walk is just a reminder of the royal history and why this place is so special to be at. Since that day, I visit that place every few months just to be there and experience the hospitality of the great place that Taj Mahal"
"This is our second visit to the hotel the last time we had a large suite in the tower wing,but we preferred our smaller suite in the historic wing.actually much more modern and cheerful  facilities.overall a great hotel would recommend this as the only hotel to stay at in Mumbai."
"Taj hotel has excellent hospitality which I have seen first time in India. Nice to stay with full enjoyment.food, service and hospitality. It's not just a luxury 5-star hotel. The kind of personal care and attention you get here is far superior than any other star studded hotels. The butlers are always there with a smile to help."
I enjoyed so much my stay at the Taj.  I had read in a previous review that it needed to be refurbished but that is what give it it charm.  I am tired of those aceptic hotels.  Linen and everything was perfect.  I was upgraded and I had a magnificent view a the start of India.  The fact you can open the sliding door and breath the air (I didn't write fresh air as this is Mumbai after all) is a bonus.  Restaurants are over priced but they gave me a discount in the end.  The staff went out of the way to make me feel special.  Loved it.
"I am very satisfy and very happy.The iconic Taj Mahal Palace hotel of Mumbai is truly a grandeur in its location, food, service and hospitality. It's not just a luxury 5-star hotel. The kind of personal care and attention you get here is far superior than any other star studded hotels. The butlers are always there with a smile to help. The historic hotel..."
"There is no doubting this is a stunning hotel with a beautiful relaxing pool area and fantastic staff. I'll be really honest, I opted for the cheapest room just to have the opportunity to stay there while trying to not to blow the budget on a multi-city stay. Unfortunately this led to being given a room next to the housekeeping cupboard which let to a rather noisy stay. I would most definitely recommend the hotel whilst recommending asking for a room away from housekeeping, or take earplugs!"
"The overall structure makes u feel you are 100 yrs back as an ancient Indian with the honor of entering into the Maharajah palace, with a sea view in the back. the lighting in the dark lights up the brightness in you..forgetting your worries"
"The iconic Taj Mahal Palace hotel of Mumbai is truly a grandeur in its location, food, service and hospitality. It's not just a luxury 5-star hotel. The kind of personal care and attention you get here is far superior than any other star studded hotels. The butlers are always there with a smile to help. The historic hotel tour was interesting too. It is truly a class apart."
The best time ever top class hotel that meets everything one could hope for and more. If ever you get a chance to stay in this iconic hotel look out for the guiding tour not well advertised but a must to do the guide so knowledgable and very funny also lookout for him on UTUBE under whywedowhatwedo no spaces. Restaurant everything you could wish for the swimming pool a dream site.
"We had two stays at the Taj one in Jan/Feb, Excellent hotel and fantastic service. We stayed in the Palace wing with a great view out to sea and the India Gate,we found the butler service excellent breakfast in our room looking out to the sea. We ate in three of the restaurants our favourite Marsala Kraft fantastic Indian food. The pool is a nice relaxing place to spend a few hrs after a day sight seeing, great service around the pool. This hotel is a must place to stay, before our departure the butler printed our boarding pass and helped with the packing."
"The Taj Mahal Place has the most celebrated address in Mumbai!  A sign in the hotel proclaims that once upon a time a visionary had a dream to lift his country in the eyes of the world; a desire to draw attention to the city he loved. From the day this hotel opened, it was acknowledged as India´s finest hotel. I can understand why.  The entire hotel is exquisitely designed with a great attention to detail. Public areas were decorated with antiques, silk carpets, contemporary art & crystal chandeliers. The staff were very attentive & nothing was too much. I´ve never known such service & efficiency. Our room was lovely & comfortable & overlooked the Gateway of India. Our tour operator described this hotel called it deluxe. I´d say very deluxe.  There was a wonderful buffet"
"We arrived here after a 10 hours from Jaipur. We were tired, hungry and in much need of a shower/bath. We decided as part of our tour of India we would include some 5 star hotels, I'm so glad we paid extra to stay here. I have never seen anything like it, from tue outside architecture to inside the lobby I was amazed, tue flower arrangements the aroma (lemon grass & mandarin) may I also add I now have this smell throughout my house.   We got to reception and were greeted with a smile, we told the man our name and he said ""I have some good news for you! You have been upgraded"". You can imagine our faces, he then said ""wait till you see the rooms, you will love them"". We were led away to the library bar and given a cocktail while we checked-in, in comfort.   Our rooms were In the"
"It was always a dream to stay in this iconic place once in lifetime and dream came true for me in aug 2014. Location of the hotel is best in Mumbai. Food is good but room service is bit slow. Rooms are a bit small and will offer you view of Arabian sea. Don't forget to watch documentary about the history of this hotel, it is simply amazing."
"this is it and you will depart this world happy. Superlative in every sense, service so unobtrusive and efficient that you almost do not notice it. View of The Gateway to India from our room in the old Palace wing. You must try the Iron Cuisine, based on India's largest laundry."
"We stayed 3 days at the wonderful Taj Mahal Palace recently for business and pleasure.    We took Trip-Advisor travellers advice and stayed in the Palace wing, with a view to the gateway of India.  The TM Palace dates back to 1903 and is an incredible structure with much history - including the first licensed bar in India, priceless art work and unique architecture - and an enthusiastic and proud staff who are more than happy to discuss all of this with you.  We took the wonderful daily tour of the hotel at 5PM (highly recommended and free) for an hour.  The pool area is an oasis from the honking horns and pollution of Mumbai.  Ceiling fans, provide comfort and the service, whilst somewhat slow, was always friendly and deferential.  The front desk, concierge and bell staff"
"I was in Mumbai on business for 5 days and decided to try the Taj Mahal Palace. To my delight I was upgraded to the Palace wing- this part of the hotel is very beautiful! I tried almost all the restaurants and bars during my stay, and must say that I was only disappointed once (small dinner by the pool- poor fish dish). The Arabic and Japanese restaurants were amazing, the Chinese was good, and breakfast was delightful. Add to this the impeccable service level throughout my stay (very helpful concierge, housekeeping that left little surprises behind each day in the form of little useful gadgets) and I can only conclude that it was truly a wonderful experience. If I may make a suggestion for improvement: my room (367) did smell a little ""stuffy"" and could use some freshening up,"
"Taj in Indian means unique and it is.  Stayed in the tower with a lovely view of the Indian Gate and the Arabian Sea.Although I have stayed more luxurious hotel rooms the atmosphere, the staff and the aura of the hotel means that once visited you will always return.  Great pool and I recommend the 1 hour tour of the hotel [great guide full of interest and history] and the afternoon tea."
"Stayed here on my arrival for the first time to India, fabulous hotel great service was perfect, upgraded to a suite never asked for it so nice, Japanese restaurant was fabulous as good as any I have ever eaten in would highly recommend to stay here even just for tradition of Indian hospilatity and old school service"
"Arrived at Taj Mahal Palace and hotel upgraded us from tower to palace suite including club membership which gives many extra benefits.  Large room very clean with good views over town and sea. Staff very helpful, especially recommend 5pm tour around hotel.  Mumbai has much traffic noise from car horns and this can still be heard on 6th floor.  Food in restaurants excellent but can be expensive.  Most enjoyable stay."
"Never stayed here, but did stop by for lunch in the rooftop restaurant. It is very convenient for the local sightseeing, I was in India on business, but came here on a day off.   Great range of excellent food and wine, it is far from the cheapest option, but worth it."
"My only complaint about this wonderful hotel, is that any other hotel I stay in will never live up to my time at the Taj!  I was lucky enough to stay in one of the wonderful Palace Club rooms in the heritage wing of the hotel, which afforded me some wonderful views of the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea, particularly at sunrise and sunset.  Upon arrival I was taken into the Palace Lounge where a cool towel and a refreshing drink made the check in process very pleasant, before being escorted to my room, where I was introduced to my butler, Adrian.  Adrian took the time to find out what my plans were, offering to make appropriate reservations as well as providing much useful information about the hotel and facilities.   In fact there was nothing that I asked for that Adrian"
"My extended family and I returned for a wonderful and celebratory long weekend at the utterly splendid Grand Dame of Mumbai - the epic Taj Mahal Palace. This was not my first stay and once again I truly enjoy the hotel's perfect location, unique atmosphere and decor and generally rather good service. Once again, the concierge team outdid themselves and hence my special thanks!  The only disappointment is breakfast! We were booked in the Palace wing and after a more-than-disappointg breakfast on the first day at the Sea Lounge, decided to have breakfast by the pool and were obliged to use the hotel's all-day-dining buffet. I am not sure what is goig on there but the buffet is way too small for the amount of people that were resorting to behave more like voltures than human being."
"The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is  a hotel where excellence reigns -Our expectations were exceeded by reality.This hotel is the most elegant hotel we have ever visited.It has  proudly hosted Royalty ,celebrities,and the worlds most distinguished guest for over 110 years and it is easy to see why.Not only do I enthusiastically recommend this property to fellow travelers but anybody in the travel and hospitality business should visit here to observe and experience how a  true luxury hotel should be run. The hotel takes one back to a forgotten era and the services,food pool and spa are deserving of 10 stars.When management observed upon check in via passport that it was my wife's birthday-we were upgraded to a grand oceanfront suite and presentations of gifts,flowers and cakes"
"Best hotel that I have ever experience! Service, room quality, food... everything was there! It is a fantastic property, well secure and very luxurious! I have stayed in the palace wing with sea view, and the room was so beautiful! The service is just outstanding!! Next trip with a destination on that part of the world, I will definitely stop in Mumbai for a night in the Taj ! "
Sadly the Taj Mahal Palce hotel although commands one of the finest views in Mumbai needs quite allot of upgrading. The rooms are no comaprison to the other Taj hotels and need new linen. The service is superb and the restauarants are excellent with modern and tradional Indian dishes - although perhaps a little too much on the western side.
"We ended our month in India with the luxury of the Taj and were not disappointed. Wonderful old fashioned hotel, but with everything you need. A good room, very comfortable, and with a view over the Gateway to India. Great choice of restaurants for breakfast and dinner. Excellent staff and service. We ate at the Mediterranean restaurant on the top floor- fantastic.  We expected it to be expensive and it was, but don't begrudge a penny! . "
"A great experience.   A hotel with location, grand architecture and a most attentive staff. Exemplary service all round but a special thank you Arif the driver and Abhay the chef. The deluxe rooms overlook the Gateway to India, have massive beds and all the facilities expected of a 5 star hotel.  The flowers on the bath mat, a cable tidy played on my phone charger and staff with an obsession for details round of a great experience."
"Stayed for two night just after New Year while making our way round India. Check in took too long but when we walked into our room - WOW - we were taken back with delight. The room overlooked the bay and India Gateway in all its glory was there, Sunrise was spectacular.  Breakfast is really average, opted for the buffet style (Have had better elsewhere), we didnt eat in as there were better places to eat in the City (Leopolds for one)  I couldnt get over the prices for drinks etc which isnt helped by the 17,42% tax levy.  Overall a great ecpierience but I dont think we will be going back in a hurry.   PS, the 17.00 hotel tour is worth a pop and its free :-)"
"A beautiful hotel, decor stunning, and views of sea and India Gate great.  Well worth staying in the Palace rooms as rooms lovely and comfortable. Lovely hot water so after a week or so staying in safari lodges with cold showers it was absolute luxury having a hot bath and showers. Staff very friendly and constantly checking to make sure everything was ok. Try the Habour Cocktail if you like Gin as it tastes lovely and how they make it is amazing. Breakfast in the Seaview Resturant was lovely so much choice and also ate in the Masala Kraft resturant one night for dinner which was interesting though expensive Indian food. Definitely want to return ......"
"Step back in time to enjoy great service and courtesy that I thought was forgotten, if you like boutique minimalistic hotels this is not for you, fixtures and fittings are from a bygone era, I can imagine all the worlds dignitaries staying here at some point over the past hundred years or so, there is an abundance of international restaurants serving excellent food and wine, the pool area is breathtaking looking up at the hotel building, the international breakfast is probably the most extensive I have ever seen, shops and extensive spa therapy is also available in the hotel."
"A fabulous hotel. Wonderful location. Extremely comfortable room. Great bathroom. Staff very  nice and helpful. Restaurant menus looked inviting but seemed overpriced. Fortunately there are excellent restaurants a short walking distance away : Trishana (seafood ), Kyber ( Afgan,indian ),Indigo (fusion )."
The hotel is gorgeous and evidently basking in its ancient heritage. We were there around tea time coincidentally and had the best Masala Chai and Pocorr basket ( fresh indian pastries) at the pool cafeteria. Don't buy anything from the hotel shops as they are way too overpriced and you can find the same quality in any local neighborhood market.  
"Well it certainly lives up to its reputation. Undoubtedly the best customer care I've ever had. We stayed for the last 2 nights of our India trip and it was worth every penny!   Unfortunately I was not very well on arrival with slight sickness , but what a place to be ill! I had flowers and fruit delivered and constantly monitored with either a phone call or visit to my room. They even had a ""not feeling well"" menu!   Food was superb. Comfort - unbelievable ... Truly incredible experience"
"Stayed there in May 2014 on a business trip. The service is fantastic, almost anticipated...you think it and the staff are already doing it.  My room overlooked the pool garden area. Food is great and there is a brilliant bookshop on the ground floor. Bought a few good books and some hard to find Indian classic music. Worth a visit. Another tip is thhat if you walk out of the hotel and turn left and left again...there is a Starbucks located at the back of the hotel."
We liked it a lot except that for older people like me  the room  are located  For away from elevator no railings on the wall  for holding  when you are taking steps It is has to update faciltlies for older people   You r paying 700. To 800 dollars  per day  I donot know is. It worth the  price   U need to upgrade the hotel faclilites  to 21st century   Level here found  in  us  disabilty accces  is hardly  there
My family and I spent five nights here last month.  The hotel is splendid!  Our room overlooked the Gateway to India.  The pool area is beautiful.  The breakfast buffet is terrific as is the spa.  Both the French and Chinese restaurants are not to be missed!  
"great service, location and decor. traffic outside can be testing! ball room is beautiful,   wasabi sushi is amazing and expensive. high tea at sea lounge is brilliant Golden dragon is not as good as it used to be, pretty ok black forest cake at le patisie is the best cake in bombay"
we have stayed in the  Oberoi with friends who were very disappointed - their first visit to India and they said that the hotel could have been in any large city. Now we always go to the Taj Mahal Palace and we have never been sorry. The ambiance and the service are faultless and a room with the view of Gateway to India is breathtaking. To our mind a much better position than any other hotel
"You have the Taj Mahal Tower and then you have the Taj Mahal Palace and you are entering a very different world and you are experiencing something totally different. Once you enter in the Taj Mahal you are captivated by the grandeur of the place outside and inside. Like most of the palace the room in the Tower is disappointing as all the investment has been made on the reception hall. But this was the Tower. And than we discover the Palace or Palazzo and everything change. This is the old part of the hotel.  All is beautiful, the furniture, the art.....silk, opulence, marble, precious, Murano Chandeliers..... The service is even better. Really first class. This part is much more luxury and exclusive. This is a place there none guest are not welcome, which is very as the hotel is"
"Everything about the Taj experience was above expectations. The hotel has two wings, choose the right wing for your price point.  I would strongly recommend the location where it is possible to walk to most of the tourist district. Each of the restaurants serves a different style of food and they were truly great. The pool is an oasis within the massive city of Mumbai. Security is extremely high and offers the highest level of protection for foreign guests."
"great hotel, value for money for sure, friendly stuff and good location...maybe to crowdy  For sure this is one of the expensivest hotel in Mumbai but worth spending some € more for this experience...."
"Amazing stay at amazing location located next to Gateway of Mumbai. Very calm and relaxing. Just a five minute walk away you will find cool restaurant,cafes and pubs. Hotel staff were very humble and kind.Over feel way royal."
"We were so disappointed when we realised we'd booked a room in the tower and not in the Palace, but it was OK because they gave us a free upgrade to the Palace! We were over the room, and our room was just perfect. Considering we were just a pair of grubby backpackers, they treated us like we were royalty. Every member of staff greeted us with a smile, whether a cleaner or a receptionist. They left us little gifts in our room before we checked out, such a lovely surprise. We enjoyed having drinks in the Harbour Bar, delicious cocktails! We also went on the daily tour, very funny and informative guide who kept everyone's attention the whole time. I would strongly recommend this! We left with huge smiles on our faces, and hopefully we can go back one day!"
"Everything about this hotel is outstanding. The service, the vibe, the efficiency. It's literally in a class of it's own.   It completely changes your whole experience and well worth a stay or even a visit. Even if only for one night  The food is impeccable.   Honestly I can't find a single fault about this place.   Great location too"
"Old colonial hotel set in the best location, near the harbour and other must-see sights. Stayed for 48 hours, and it was the perfect place to relax amidst Mumbai madness.  Didn't need to venture too far for a leisurely walk along Marine Drive.. Indulged in the spa as well which was amazing, and reasonably priced. Flawless service albeit a little too impersonal. Stayed in the Palace Wing, The room had all the nice touches but had a musty smell to it."
"A lovely sanctuary in the middle of Mumbai. We arrived tired early morning after overnight flight and was greeted by attentive and quiet staff who gave us breakfast and an easy checkin service. By 11 the room was ready and we could fully appreciate this wonderfull hotel with old style bathrooms, great ballrooms and a heavenly courtyard with swimmingpool and cafe. The staff was the best we encountered on our whole trip, friendly - natural and very good at making us feel at home. Most hotels in India are eager to offer service - but only Taj does it with a natural friendly and competent style. We will come again:)"
"This has to be one of the best hotels to stay in Mumbai, it is right in the heart of the tourist sights, and if you want a hotel with a view this is it.  Get a room with a sea view and you will have a view of the Gate Way of India, one of the most iconic sights of India.  There is a choice of 3 restaurants for breakfast, all serving a buffet with european or Indian cuisine, this has to be the best hotel in Mumbai, catering for every need."
"My husband and I and our two older teenage sons stayed here for two nights mid January this year. We had booked 2 club rooms with sea views. Good value if booked with an early bird special. Rooms were beautiful, view spectacular, and the palace lounge privileges were such a luxury. Included breakfast, high tea, cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, and cognac and chocolates - all at various times during the day. This was a special occasion for us being my birthday and our wedding anniversary. Staff surprised us with rose petal bath, special greeting cushions, rose petals in designs on the floor, chocolate cake etc. On our second night we were surprised with an upgrade to the 3 story penthouse suite. Very special indeed. The guest relations people knew our names and always greeted us"
We have visited Hotel Tajmahal Palace Mumbai last month. This was a truely wonderful experience. I have never experienced such service in any other hotel. I strongly recommend this hotel. Thanks  Sanjay Jain

This is the most amazing hotel I have stayed in Bombay. I would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to Bombay/Mumbai. We had a clean and basic room for less than 150 dollars. Stayed one night on our way to Goa. The bar nearby - Irish house is great. Nice clean hotel
"one of the finest hotel over in india with lot of leisure and deluxe service specially with traditional service.wish we could have stayed a few more days. Our room was in the palace section of the hotel. We had a stunning view of the Gateway and the sea. The room was comfortable, the toilet was great. It wasnt impeccably clean sadly"
Awesome place. Tasty food and excellent service. I would to check in again. Good ambience also. People were nice. Restaurant have a peace and soothing environment with slow melodious music. It has preserved our ancient Indian style and tradition.  Thank to manager wo has amazing iratory skills. Great hospitality.
recently stayed there n one of their suites for a friends wedding and i wuz shocked to see the size of the suite and the facilities . Huge bungalow like duplex. almost 40 people were inside at one time partying .
"What can I say - the Taj Palace, Mumbai is perfect in every way - and I am not easily pleased. The staff are truly amazing, and that's what made our stay so special. The check in staff were great -Jaspreet Singh Jolly and his colleague  in particular made us extremely welcome when we arrived very late having forgotten to book a room for our fist night, Jaspreet had already taken care of everything. Housekeeping were truly awsome they couldnt do enough to make you feel comfortable - after a small issue with our original room, Shruti Danuke arranged for flowers to be in our room on our return the next day - a lovely touch that was very much appreciated. The Taj itself is wonderful........much more to it than you could ever see from photos.  A beautiful beautiful hotel - the tour"
"The single bad part of this stay was that it only lasted 1 night - wish we could have stayed a few more days. Our room was in the palace section of the hotel. We had a stunning view of the Gateway and the sea. The room was comfortable, the toilet was great. It wasnt impeccably clean sadly, but better than other 5 star hotels in India in my experience. The service and hospitality was great. The breakfast buffet wasnt the best Ive seen but everything was delicious.  Truly made to feel special by the staff. Thank you for a great stay!"
"Good, but not excellent. I think it needs to be clear where you're stopping. We were in the tower wing, facing the gateway to India. The view was incredible. I had booked through agoda and because my booking said the taj mahal palace, thats where i thought we'd be, but for the price we'd paid, £167 I suppose I should  have known. I just didn't feel that the welcome was grand enough and there is a definite separation between the palace and the tower. Even though the room was nice, it  wasn't spectacular, it was a bit dusty and they had forgot to put on the fancy bed runner and cushions. I found them in a cupboard under the tv and put it on myself. The bathroom was a bit dated. I agree with someone else's comment that you could be in a holiday inn in the tower wing. What did"
"As we stayed in the Tower wing, the experience is diluted. The Palace wing guests get more of the pamper.  The family decided to spend 3 nights at the Taj and also bring in the New Year!  Check in facilities went all smoothly, given the rush of the 31st / New Year's Eve.  We asked for interconnecting rooms and we did get that. We booked the sea facing rooms, so the view was spectacular.  Staff throughout the hotel are courteous and always willing to help.   We did find the Festivity Desk staff rude when we went to check on our booking for the 31st night party, due to late arrival and wanting to rest, we wanted to cancel the 31st night party and went to the desk for the procedure, while it is understood that a last minute cancellation will incur costs which is fine, but the girls"
"The staff is very helpful and genuinely want to help and ensure that you have everything you need - whether the cleaning staff, the restaurant manager, or the butler in the conference room (who I especially point out for outstanding service).  The gym and pool facilities are top notch and clean as are all the restaurant facilities. Conference rooms and ball room are also gilded.  Given the hotel's past (target of terrorist attack), I really think it must have pulled the staff together to provide exemplary service.  Hotel could provide tour buses and a map of the hotel and surrounding are to make things easier."
"Words cannot describe what a remarkable Hotel this truly is !! Next time we shall stay for that bit longer, One night is not enough to expirience everything the hotel has to offer !!  We arrived at 20:30 and was swiftly checked in and warmly welcomed by Anup who is part of the reception team. Anup then took us to our Room 1706 in the Tower Wing where he explained everything to do with our room including setting the Air conditioning etc (which was better than i orginally thought it would be, this room was one up from the basic room and it was truly luxurious and had everything we could truly need or want) and the services offered by the Hotel, I asked him what time the sun rose over the harbour and he was spot on to the minute, he advised us to wake up that bit earlier to view"
"I have to say that this is one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in. Location and service are both excellent.  Having read other trip advisor reviews, we decided to spend a little more and book a palace room rather than the tower and I did not regret it.  The staff could not do enough for you and as it was our wedding anniversary they had decorated the room with heart shaped balloons!  The pool area is lovely and never too busy with a good sized swimming pool and they constantly brought you water to keep you cool. This is a truly first class hotel and I would highly recommend it."
"We stayed here in Palace Wing.  Please note, this hotel have ""Tower Wing and ""Palace Wing"".   The palace wing is the legacy and you should stay here to experience the stay.  The entire hotel has beautiful interior inside and especially we liked the grand staircase. The hotel is at convienent location and you can visit Gateway of India and Marine drive is few miles away.  We got a room with partial view of Gateway of India and we really enjoyed it. The hotel check in process was very smooth, check in was happen at lounge with welcome drink. There was no waiting at the lobby in the line. :)  The hotel staff is very courteous and very promptly responded all the time.  The breakfast buffet at Shamiyana has with all kind of spread (Indian/continental etc.) and is definitely one of"
"Staying here was an exceptional experience. There is nothing more that one could want from a hotel. Service is impeccable. We felt like our every need was anticipated in advance - from the finger that appeared from nowhere to push the lift button to the flower strewn complimentary footbath that mysteriously materialised in our room after a hard, hot day tramping the streets of Mumbai with a card that said ""just call housekeeping and we will fill it with hot water for you"". How did they know we needed that?! The room, which was in the tower wing overlooked the iconic Gateway of India was extremely comfortable, with all the facilities we could want. We had breakfasts (and what a breakfasts!) on the garden terrace surrounding the outdoor pool and swam in the pool in the evening. "
"It seemed my second visit within a year to Mumbai would not be complete until I had set foot in the 5 star Taj Mahal Palace hotel and the building itself would impress anyone.  We headed straight for the cocktail lounge which was beautifully appointed with very attentive waiters and long cool drinks.  The idea was then to have an evening meal in the International restaurant and we were duly shown to our table.  We decided not to have wine as the prices were extortionate, bypassed on a starter and just ordered from the 'mains' menu.  The prices were comparable to London's West End venues and we expected something special but to our great disappointment this did not happen!  I had ordered lamb shank and asked the waiter if vegetables were served with this dish...his answer was in"
All I can say is what a wonderful time we had at the hotel. When you first walk in to the reception you smell fresh lemons. Someone comes over and takes your details and checks you in. Whilst waiting you receive a complimentary drink. The rooms we had were lovely overlooking the Gateway of India.  Housekeeping was very attentive.  Breakfast by the pool was relaxing and very pleasant.  Couldn't fault the service we had on our visit and if we visit Mumbai again the Taj Mahal palace is the place we would stat
"The Taj really does live up to its name.   Everything about this hotel is excellent, from the unbeatable location overlooking the Gateway of India, to the ambiance, food, friendly staff and the rooms.   The in-house restaurants are on the costly side but there isn't a lack of eating places in Mumbai so this isn't a problem. The theme tune on the in-house channel is addictive. The chaos of Mumbai is forgotten once inside the walls of the hotel.  One should stay in this hotel at least once in their lifetime."
"Superb rooms, amazing hospitality & top notch restaurants!  Undoubtedly the best that Mumbai can offer!  Superheats Room Service! Got additional toiletries and replenishments within minutes.  Very smooth & courteous chi in & chi out process!   Lovely poolside restaurant for breakfast with a lavish spread!"
Very good rooms with fine service. Very good breakfast at 3 different spots. Exceptional lounge and staff members are very helpful with any information or needed help. Best location in front of GATE OF INDIA on the promenade. Not far from Gandi road and some of the most beautiful colonial buildings of Mumbai
The Taj Mahal Palace is a wonderful experience. The hotel does a lovely tour of the building every afternoon so you can learn some history of both the building and the city. Its quite a large hotel yet the service was always good. We stayed on the top floor so the rooms are old style and beautiful.
I have over 1000 nights in hotels across the world...  This is the best service I have ever seen.  Each and every person in the hotel was committed to ensuring I had the best possible experience.  They are always willing to take care of any (reasonable) request.  Make sure you go to the Japanese restaurant Wasabi.  really good food and service.
"We have been very fortunate to have stayed at this grand Hotel four times now and on each occasion we find more reasons to visit again. This is such a lovely friendly place to stay. The rooms are excellent the staff are the best and they attend to your needs exceptionally well. The choice of restaurants are the best and should be savoured on any visit. A must is to do the heritage tour of the Hotel it does not take long but it is certainly worthwhile and entertaining. Another must is to sample the special cocktail they do in the Harbour Bar, get the barman to tell you the story and have your camera ready."
"If you have time please read... 18/12/14 – I have send query via Email from website asking for complementary stay (being a Taj Innercircle Member) for SATURDAY 31JAN 2015   19/12/14 - Pooja Rajamony sends email asking for the date (though the same was given)                                         19/12/14 – Alroy Noronha sends email about sending the request to the Vivanta by Taj (I believe they are not yet fully automated – they have to send email to check for the rooms availability and that too to their own property)                          26/12/14 – I am reminding them by writing email, asking them about the status of my query, AS ITS BEEN MORE THAN A WEEK… and why should Taj Worry about my query?

"Got a good deal on the Taj for a few nights in January.  It's a classic hotel - beautiful from the outside, nice lobby, and a great pool.  We had a Tower room - which is fairly small - so we didn't spend much time there.  It's on the city side of town which is fun.  But a lot of the new restaurants and bars have opened up in Bandra - which can take a fair bit of time to reach in traffic.  All in all, the Taj is a classic so you can't go wrong staying here."
"Copy of our feedback to the Hotel. Our six-night stay was terrific. The accommodations were spotless; the staff was not just accommodating but also anticipated our needs. All of our interactions were positive. We selected the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel Mumbai for its location. We do not usually book at five-star hotels, but keep our costs a bit lower. However, this five-star was an excellent value and an excellent experience. (We used some of our Online booking companies past rewards to lower the cost some).  Mukesh at the travel desk did a fine job, setting up a driver for us through the Taj Hotel in Aurangabad for our Ellora & Ajanta Caves adventure. Sehdev, our room attendant, and Renuka, our housekeeper, saw to every detail, from eyeglass cleaning cloths to managing the cords on"
The Grand Old Dame of Indian hospitality still has what it takes. Went on business and also attended the recent Christies India Sale auction. I requested a certain blend of Darjeeling Tea and the Concierge spent the next 2 days looking for it himself and keeping me updated on progress - truly exceptional personal service. one of my fellow guests required a certain medication which was promptly procured and sent to the bar where we were having a drink. another time we urgently needed some passport photos and the girl at reception (this was during check-in) called a nearby shop and got them to keep it open a while longer for us. Karan at the Sea Lounge ensured I got the tea brewed the way I preferred it. at the level the small touches count for a lot. when there are newer flashier
This wonderful hotel is a great reprieve from the heat and dust of the streets of Mumbai.  The staff are wonderful and the service in all aspects is amazing.  The rooms and bathrooms are big and spacious with lovely luxurious linens.  I would absolutely recommend this hotel.
"Yes, I know, it's old (110 years young). Yes,  I know, it's very traditional and a lot of people want brand new (nothing wrong with that). But The Taj is more.  The staff are simply wonderful. They know what they are doing and do it well. They are happy. The rooms are comfortable and don't feel like a momentary place to stay but a beautiful room at a friend's house (with spectacular views).  The food is very good and there will be something for everyone to relish. The location is great. Right next to The India Gate and Colaba Market (take care with the the sellers near the Gate - they are extremely persistent, not to say annoying). You will Love  your stay at The Taj."
"After watching the TV documentary about the Taj last September we decided that this would be a great base for the celebration of our 30th wedding anniversary. It was also Mel's ? th birthday.  I booked directly with the hotel & all of my requests were met with due consideration  From our greeting at the airport to our departure, the 4 day stay was absolutely perfect. I had booked the transfers using a Jaguar, the ideal form of transport considering that the hotel founder's company now owns Jaguar. Our driver acted as an excellent tour guide during the 1 hour drive.  We were greeted by ""Sam"" in reception who escorted us to our room to complete the check in process. Throughout our stay she made continuing contact to ensure that everything was OK.  Our room on the 3rd floor of the"
I am over in India with my father reliving many of his tales as a boy as he was born in Mumbai. The hotel is in very good shape with impeccable service. The swimming pool is marvellous as is the eating area by the pool. The breakfasts are ok nothing to write back home about. Our room was a seafront apartment with good views over the gateway to India. The facilities were good with good wifi. I understand that the tower is not so good so be careful what you are asking for. Position is great. I would recommend alibaba restaurant which is walkable if you want a good meal in decent surroundings.
"We stayed at the Taj Mumbai on both the first night and the last night of a 2 week holiday in India. For the fist single night stay we booked a room in the Palace wing specifically to get a view from the front of the hotel of the Gate of India which did not disappoint. On the first stay we were in room 256. There is a lovely raised area within the bay window to sit and look out, and where we had a great room service breakfast the next morning looking out over the bay. Nice bathroom and facilities and a very comfortable bed. The hotel itself is grand but not stuffy and the facilities within the hotel are excellent with 6 restaurants to choose from and other places for snacks and afternoon tea. We ate dinner on the first occasion at Shamiana which is the International restaurant."
As someone who has stayed in many hotels over the years I can say that the Taj Mahal Palace is probably the worlds best heritage hotel and a relative bargain as well.  On arrival the security procedures are a bit daunting but reassuring given the hotel's history.  Checking is very quick and simple. We were accompanied to the room and the rather sophisticated systems explained. The room's butler then arrived with a very welcome and free lime and soda (accompanied by sugar syrup and salt).  The room was beautiful and in immaculate repair. It overlooked the harbour and the Gate. That is a busy spot but the room was absolutely quiet.  There was a hall inside the door which could be closed off from the bedroom blocking any hotel noise.  The bed was excellent. The bath room was marble
"We stayed here at the beginning of a rather long tour of India, and for hotels in its class, this was one of our more unimpressive experiences. Importantly, we stayed here in 2006 in the Palace Wing and had a wonderful time, and were wowed. I'm not sure whether the service is really that different between the Palace Wing and the Tower Wing (where we stayed this time), or whether things have gone downhill, but I went into this hotel stay with very high expectations. My review is based on my expectation based on past experience.   In the past, when we checked in, we felt like royalty (like you would feel when checking into an Oberoi, for example). This time, we had a pretty standard check in, much like you would have at a Hyatt or Marriott.   The Tower Wing rooms are not nearly so"
One ambition fulfilled... To enjoy a G & T in the Taj Mahal Hotel Palace.  Tall Glass......lots of ice.......large Bombay Sapphire.....squeeze of lemon......tonic.....  Nice..... Thank you very much.  Very rewarding treat at the end of a busy day sight seeing in Mumbai.
"This is my second visit to this fabulous hotel, and having been to many hotels all over the the world this is by far my favourite. The service is amazing - they even anticipate what you might need. Nothing is too much, and everything is made easy. I had a club room and was entitled to tea, but I sat by mistake in the wrong room to take it. This was not a problem, they let me enjoy where I was, nothing was added as a supplement. The rooms are wonderful, the view is amazing and I cannot find fault with anything, however hard I look. The pool is fabulous, the spa is great, the gym is excellent, and you are right in the centre of shopping once you leave the hotel. The staff were very proud to be working there. It is a very special place and a privilege to stay there."
Having been to Mumbai the previous year and experienced excellent hospitality I was excited to be staying at this hotel but was extremely disappointed with my 2 night stay.    The hotel is in a great location but that’s the only good thing about it.  The rooms are nothing special and in my room in the Tower there was a problem with the floor which made it potentially dangerous.  I was offered what was described to me as an upgrade to a Palace Room but the room was so small I declined as I was leaving the next day.    There is a good choice of food available at breakfast but it is in a very busy restaurant where there are queues for everything and lots of children running around.  I was shown to a table but by the time I had got food from the buffet the table was occupied by
"I think it's really hard to beat the Taj Palace if you are staying in Mumbai.  The property is beautiful.  The outdoor pool provides a tranquil oasis in busy Mumbai.  The staff is top notch; really some of the best I've ever seen.  They are courteous, professional, and efficient.  We stayed in one of the Tower room.  It was clean and nicely appointed.  An arrangement of flower petals greeted me each day I returned to my room.  The staff even put bookmarks in all my books.  I dined at most of the restaurants in the hotel and they were all great.  I think Mumbai is so big that no one location is going to meet everyone's needs, but there is a lot to see and do within walking distance of the Taj.  The one small thing I found slightly lacking was the wifi.  The complementary wifi is"
"Our entire family (4 adults + 4 kids) stayed at the Taj over the holidays, and in general it was a nice hotel. Service was as expected excellent, in particular the concierge helped us organize tours and everything went off without a hitch. We stayed in the historical building of the hotel, which I would not necessarily recommend - it was not possible to get connected rooms (or at least we weren't able to), although the breakfast area has wonderful water views. I would highly recommend taking the complimentary hotel tour (offered daily) to get a sense of the hotel's history.  The pool at the hotel was certainly underwhelming for our kids after having stayed at other hotels with larger and nicer pool areas. The pool is quite deep, so if you have small kids who are not very"
"We stayed in the Bella Vista Suite in January 2015. As the names suggests, the Suite has a great view of the Arabian Sea and the Gateway of India. The Hotel is an iconic heritage hotel and the Palace wing is well deserving of its name; it's both gorgeous and elegant. If you plan to stay at this Taj, make it the palace wing, you wont be disappointed.  The Suite is beautiful, luxurious and spacious and comes with everything one could ask for. The good people at Taj were aware that we were on our honeymoon so they sent up some complimentary chocolate cake and red wine. The cake was a delicious mousse cake. The wine was good. The butler was extremely efficient. Service was impeccable as expected."
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for 3 nights. This historic hotel has a unique charm, missing in most modern hotels. Had a great view of the India Gate from my room on the Tower Wing. There are two sections of the hotel - The Palace wing and the Tower wing - which I wasn't aware at the time of booking. So choose the wing that you prefer to be in. The service was great for the most part. The only downside I experienced was the queue for the breakfast buffet. I sincerely hope the hotel finds out a way of handling this issue. Would highly recommend the hotel."
This was the most fantastic hotel I've ever stayed at. The facilities and staff were fabulous. Your wish is their command! I felt like a princess the whole 2 weeks I stayed there with my husband. There is nothing the staff won't do for you. Dinesh Gupta in the Sea Lounge was extremely attentive at breakfast and I only had to blink and there was another pot of masala chai (tea) on my table and he was pouring me another cup!  Hubby got an array of Indian breakfasts specially prepared and served as well as the huge sumptuous buffet on offer every morning. Dinesh was really top class.  The tour of the hotel at 5 pm is not to be missed. Very informative and entertaining! And the tour leader knew where all the international guests had come and mentioned those countries in his talk
The architecture of the hotel brings out the atmosphere of the era of British occupation of India. Service is impeccable where hotel staff greet guests with the their sincerest smile and assist in the most polite fashion. Breakfast is delicious with a good amount of options. Size of room is descent with charming furnitures. Will return to this hotel when given the chance and will recommend to friends and family.
stayed here by myself for 2+ days before heading to Pune for work. got a nice high floor room facing the sea in the Tower. No upgrade though even though I was LHW member. The breakfast spread and the staff there were superb as usual. I did have to get my room moved as I had young children in the room next to me which I didn't want to deal with. They moved me promptly and efficiently. I had arranged for pickup at the airport which went very smoothly. I also had a pair of very nice dinners at Golden Dragon and at Indian restaurant. I will be returning to the Taj in February with my wife for a birthday vacation/celebration in a Palace Wing room and am really looking forward to this third stay at the Taj.
"We stayed here for two nights at the start of our latest adventure, this time to South India and Sri Lanka. Our sea facing room was in the Old Wing and quite magnificent, with views to match. The service was impeccable and also very friendly throughout, with some very special touches that showed they really do think of everything. I am so glad we decided to upgrade to this place from the original suggestion from our travel agent. A genuinely magnificent experience!"
"We stayed at the Taj to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. The experience was wonderful. Were upgraded to a Palace Wing Room decorated with Balloons, Bubble Bath, Heart Shape Pillows and flower petals. Wish we be here every year."
"Even after the terrorist attacks the hotel continued to maintain its elegance and top tier service. The staff great you and treat you as if you were royalty. The rooms are clean, organized and offer piece and quite while in busy Mumbai.   The restaurants in the hotel are all high class and the views of the harbor and the gateway are beautiful."
"I suppose that everyone should stay here at least once in their lives.... It has to be the most iconic hotel in the world. The television programme, and Roshan Seth's wonderful dramatisation of the hotel history, helped...... Where does one start? The greeting, the reception, the personalised tour..... The personal butler (thank you, dear Gayatri!), wonderful Viren, the Guest Experience Manager, the superb chefs, who take such an interest in what YOU like..... It all adds up to make an unforgettable experience. It really makes one reluctant to leave the hotel doors to brave the crowds outside...... With good reason! This might be a surreal experience, but it is a superb one, and, most importantly, makes one feel a million dollars."
"The most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in.  The room, the staff, the food, the atmosphere, everything is faultless.  We had breakfast at the Sea Lounge over looking the water - What a wonderful hotel.  No wonder all the kings, queens, rock stars, politician all go to this wonderful place.  Every aspect of this hotel is second to none and I can not recommend it enough.  it transports you to a different world and I have never had such an amazing experience."
"A Taj is a Taj is a Taj! Ever smiling and helpful staff, ready to cater to all your requests and an amazing location to boot! Felt the need to splurge a bit for our anniversary and enjoyed every bit of the two nights there."
"Stayed at Taj Mahal from 10 - 15 December. Highly impressed by the excellent standards in this hotel. Its definitely a cut above the rest when it comes to class and sophistication. Well-trained, efficient and helpful staff all-round, and attention to detail make all the difference here. The hotel offers a tranquil and authentic experience, we would love to go back"
"A luxury hotel with all comforts .when you stay there you forgot that  you have visited India .One thinks that is in a European luxury hotelBreakfast was very good and when we asked a different dish (meat instead of fish) that was served ,they accomplished our desire"
"Treat yourself and Live in luxury at the Taj. Nice rooms, great food, and look for the rooms facing the sea. Excellent shopping nearby .Don't forget to taste the food at  Bedamia stall just behind the hotel."
"An amazing landmark in use, service was really good, helpful staff in everything, room was beautiful. We had a New Year's Eve countdown at the hotel combined outside with the Gate of India, restaurant choices inside were expensive but nice food Italian and Indian just across the road!!"
"Probably the best hotel I've stayed in. Excellent service, staff and food. Spa, pool and all the services you could wish for. The attention to detail is second to none and would thoroughly recommend to anyone. Not cheap but you get what you pay for."
"If you can only stay one night here, you will remember it forever ...... a truly fantastic place! The rooms, the service, the food and most of all the staff are superb. The tour around the hotel was led by Viren and he was not only knowledgeable but obviously very proud of where he worked. The tour itself was fascinating and the original hotel was beautiful."
"Our three week trip to India had many highs and lows. We went to Agra to view the Taj Mahal but pea soup fog made it a touch and tell  event. The grounds were empty and we felt our way into this wonder of the world. So. The Taj Mahal palace in Mumbai is the Taj we will always remember as a high. Everything good said about grand edifice is true. Once I was there I understandwhy those who hate beauty, elegance, and art wanted to destroy this monument.  The restaurants were great. We had no issues with reservations but book ahead for the sea Lounge and high Tea. We ate great sushi in the hotel at Iron chef's Morimoto's restaurant. Who knew?!   Make sure you do the 5:00 pm hotel tour. Our hotel representative and historical/ cultural leader for the tour Viren D'sa was incredibly"
"Had a truly unique and world class experience at the Taj.  We stayed in the club section of the palace wing, and our service was impeccable.  The hotel staff were beyond accommodating--they continually searched for ways to make our stay memorable.  Their friendliness and professionalism is truly the best we have EVER experienced.  Our personal butler, Nikhil Barve, went out of our way to make certain that our bording passes were printed, our car arrangements were taken care of, and all the little details were seamlessly attend to.  Our room attendant, Harshad, spread flowers in our room every day, and surprised us daily with footbaths, gifts, and other special attention.  His attitude and service, like those of others in the hotel, is a tribute to the Taj tradition of delighting"
"I stayed here at the tail end of our trip to bambay, We actually arrived in Mumbai 3 nights before our reservation, en route to Goa (where we stayed before Mumbai) as we had arranged for the hotel to hold on to much of our luggage while we were in Goa. They were extremely helpful, and when we returned 4 days later everything was where it was supposed to be.  We arrived in Mumbai on a train from Goa at 5 in the morning, and our driver (sent from the hotel) was right there on the platform.  Check in was fast and seamless, and soon we were on our way to our beautiful heritage wing room.   We had one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in, and everything was impeccable - cleanliness, decor, the huge flatscreen tv with free movies, molton brown toiletries, huge soaking tub,"
"It is one of the best Exclusive Hotel of INDIA, it is meant for very rich people but you can visit this place to have some snacks, food , but Everyone has to visit this historic hotel. If you have around 2 to 3 k, you can have nice meal here. Abeyance is really beautiful."
"I think this is the real great Indian hotel ! Fabulous atmosphere in its busy hall , the most relaxing pool and its lovely service ! Beautiful rooms ,clean and elegant ! Dreamy and oriental delicate smells follow you throughout .... Romantic and perfect !"
"Just finished a 3 night stay at the Taj over Christmas. It certainly was an experience. It was a good stay although there were positives and negatives.  The part that stands out most in my mind is the check-in process. We had an airport pickup as part of the Club Room package. The pick-up went really well, our driver was standing at the airport behind security gates holding a sign with our name on it. He signalled for us to meet him round the back where we were greeted not only by the driver but by a gentleman who seemed to be a senior Taj employee (he told me that he was not a manager when asking – however, you could tell he was directing the Taj operations at BOM airport since they had a few pick-ups).   The drive to the hotel was pleasant and the driver was knowledgeable"
"Spent two nights in this fabulous hotel. Wow! Everything perfect also visited the spa, astrologer and restaurants and all faultless. Staff also amazing. Hotel started my trip with taj. I also visited penchant and kanna national parks which we're amazing and also Delhi. Taj are the best when it comes to style, service, food and hospitality."
"After watching the BBC2 series in the UK 'Hotel India' which was filmed at The Taj, we were bursting to visit this magical and intreguing hotel.  It truly is a magical hotel with exquist perfection to detail. The staff are absolutely wonderful and give you a truly personal experience, with nothing being too much trouble. The room keeping team were absolutely amazing and left small gifts, fresh flowers and made sure the room was looking as best as possible. The decor and art around the hotel is absolutely beautiful and we enjoyed the heritage tour. We also like the deli that was based in the hotel for beautiful chocolate and nibbles. The harbour bar was really enjoyable to visit and has a great view of the Gateway to India.  However, after staying here for 6 nights, there are a"
"I had been to Taj Mahal Palace  hotel, Mumbai  for dinning and to attend some functions/meeting earlier. But, This was my first stay at the property and it was fabulous.  Stayed as TIC gold member. Room was  upgraded to heritage wing and hence, all associated benefits like lounge access , complimentary breakfast etc. The original and legendary hospitality began from check in time. Check in formalities completed in dedicated lounge in heritage wing with welcome drink.  The room was small but, very neat  and with all luxurious amenities , fab décor.  Lunch and breakfast at Shamiana was of great taste and nice spread.  It was really retiring feeling on lazy weekend afternoon on poolside and in shamiana. Enjoyed.   Evening had some refreshments in lounge.  This century old (I"
"We spent our last night on an India tour at this iconic hotel. It is an imposing building with fantastic views of the Gateway to India from seaview rooms. We had good welcome fruit drinks and a nice dinner at their Indian speciality restaurant. Breakfast was good too. Having stayed at Taj hotels in Delhi and Mumbai, we noticed differences in the service: it was less obsequious and staff were more relaxed, reflecting the more cosmopolitan nature of the city. The hotel has a good traditional cocktail bar overlooking the sea and a trendier bar where you can escape the DJ to a pleasant garden. Like other Taj hotels there is now free wifi in the rooms, though you need to pay for a fast connection. This is a great hotel with a magnificent location and good facilities."
"Legendary place that if necessary improved and improved. Elegance and style, perfect service from bell captain to duty manager. Having a club sandwich by the pool can turn to heaven. A smell of Ylang Ylang will follow you through silent corridors. While checking out it is just if you did not feel like leaving."
My girl wanted something different for her birthday so she choose India. Luckily she choose this awesome hotel as our home base while there. We choose a room in the tower on the seventh floor. Absolutely stunning view of the gateway to India. We took day trips to Agra and around other parts of India but the surroundings were so depressing at times we just wanted to get away from it all and stay in the hotel the days after our trip. The Indian restaurant in the hotel was awesome so after I became sick from eating around Mumbai we decided to stick with the hotel restaurant. The staff could not be better and ease of getting to and from the airport was an absolute plus.
"We stayed for 3 nights in the old original part of the hotel on the second floor. When we arrived we could hear very loud music from a party going on below us somewhere. It was lucky i wanted to go out and explore the area at night, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to sleep. As we were so low and at the front of the hotel. There was a lot of noise at night from outside. I did manage to sleep with ear plugs.  The member of staff who showed us to our room, offered to have tea brought to our rooms. She didn't know if they offered decaffeinated tea, which I ordered. When the tray arrived after a considerable wait, there was only tea and biscuits for my husband. Nothing for me. We wished we hadn't waited the time it took to arrive. No mention of my missing tea was made. I was"
"Stayed in the palace wing of the hotel (supposed to be better than the towers). Location is fantastic, just beside the gateway of India. The hotel however did not live up to my expectation. Was expecting the rooms to be a lot more luxurious. They have one of the best japanese restaurants in town. The poolside is the best part of the hotel. To sum it up, i am sure you can get a room at a hotel of the same quality for cheaper."
"All that we had expected and more at this beautiful oasis in Mumbai.   Impeccable service, elegant, a lesson in good taste in all respects.   If you can stretch your budget a little, or deserve to treat yourself, it's well worth the little extra.   Well done Taj team ! "
"We stayed for two nights in the Taj Palace Hotel with rooms in the old part. We had previously been to Rajasthan where the hotels had blown us away - we did not feel the same about this hotel. Our room was atmospheric but very small being on the top floor under the eaves. The other room on the  third floor, though bigger, lacked much local feel and was very standard as far as luxury hotels go. We had access to the Club lounge which was definitely worthwhile for afternoon tea, pre-dinner cocktails and after-dinner coffee. However, the breakfast was not up to standard for a hotel of this category. The selection was poor and the quality was average. There were also too many birds outside in the pool dining area waiting to swoop as soon as you left the table. Check-out was in the"
"What a beautiful hotel with excellent views of The Gateway To India, and only a quick walk away too. The room was excellent with all the additional extras all there for you to enjoy your stay. Only down to it was the lack of organisation in the dining room at breakfast, one hand just did not know what the other was doing! Lots of staff walking around but it felt as though they were all expecting everyone else to do what was needed. Maybe as it was a full house it was just too busy for them?"
"OK there may be better hotels in town, at better prices, but you won't get the storied experience if you stay anywhere else. Definitely the hotel to see and be seen. Even the post breakfast lounging by the pool and courtyard is itself a parade of beautiful people.  As for the hotel, if only the walls could talk. Pretty much every celebrity and head of state stays here. The restaurants are excellent, the service top notch, the location perfect, and the rooms stunning (albeit a little too small, though what can you do, it was built in 1903)! Highly, highly recommended.   Plus - the only hotel I stayed in India where the wifi was free. What is with that India? Get your act together. Thank you Taj Palace!  (I stayed in the Palace, not the Tower hotel next door.)"
"Very well located in Colaba, the tourist area of the city. On check in, we were greeted like kings! We paid a few extra bucks to have a view of the sea and it was worth it. If you have the means, stay in the Palace Wing-- better service and food! Note that the food at all the restaurants are very expensive at the hotel."
"This was one of the best hotel experiences, ever. We arrived very early and were allowed to check in, which was great after a long overnight flight. The room (in the Tower) was very comfortable, with a huge bathroom and loads of amenities. Wifi was free and worked well. Every member of staff was smiling, pleasant and wanted to do everything they could to help. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas (they even had a Santa making an appearance on Xmas eve and Xmas day!)  It was lovely to eat our Xmas eve dinner outside by the pool -- the food was excellent and reasonable value (although of course much more expensive than restaurants outside the hotel). The buffet breakfast in the Shamiana restaurant was plentiful and varied, and the service level was outstanding, with"
"We stayed at Taj Mahal Place for 7 nights. Because we arrived in Mumbai at 5am (ish) we’d previously arranged private transfers from Mumbai International Airport ourselves, the drive to hotel from the airport is about 45 minutes.  The hotel did contact me a couple of days before we were due to see if I needed collecting or if there was anything I’d need for before our arrival. (Which I thought was really nice!) Check-in was very easy and straight forward, the guy on reception was nice and polite, welcoming and helpful, pointing out everything from the Wi-Fi code to the breakfast process.  There was always the most beautiful smell coming into reception!  Our room was located on the 6th floor (Room 611), there are x3 spacious lifts up to the rooms and are quick.  Upon entering the"
"I have been traveling India for thirteen years and never stayed at the Taj, but this year myself and a group of friends spent new year there. The standard of the staff and rooms were fantastic. Its a very glamorous place and better than any hotel i have stayed in, of this 5* ilk. Staff were kind, the food was amazing and the level of opulence is mind blowing. I would fully recommend a visit, even if for one or two nights. The pool is beautiful, and the heritage tour very informative. You are made to feel like a very special guest most of the time, however....  When checking into the hotel I had just returned from a pilgrimage to the holy Godavari river. I was still in my robes and popped out for some water and snacks for the NYE celebrations. The front entrance to the hotel was"
Absolutely magnificent but pricey. We would have loved to stay here but couldn't afford it so decided to have coffee at the Shamiana. Really good. Friendly staff. Unfortunately we did not have much time to look around.
"My husband and I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai on a recent tour of India and had a great experience.  This hotel is an interesting piece of Mumbai history (the hotel tour explaining this was amazing) that is still luxuriously appointed and boasts an outstanding staff and five star service.  We had an opportunity to stay first in the tower and then in the palace hotel and could recommend either, depending on your expectations.  Our tower room was comfortable but more of a four star experience, with a small bathroom and the headboard bolted to the wall.  Our room in the palace was much larger, with hardwood floors, large bathroom, beautiful separate tub and shower, sitting area, and luxurious furniture and fixtures.  The price differential reflects the difference in"
"The hotel looks better and bigger in pictures. In reality it is much smaller (at least the palace wing). The staff is nice and helpful. The rooms are quite basic and small (even by Mumbai standards). Bathrooms have electronic mirrors where you can watch TV (nice!!). While the interiors are nicely done, what surprises the most is the lack of space, in corridors, as well as inside the room. If you have seen the Taj palace hotels (Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaipur and Hyderabad), this one will come as a disappointment, otherwise it still is quite a good hotel. The Food spread is amazing. Taj's free Wi-Fi is deeply appreciated."
"If you visit Mumbai, you have to stay at this hotel.   The hotel is very beautiful and it smells amazing. Believe me, when you walk in you will know about the fruity and spicy smell that I am talking about.  The welcome was amazing. We were greeted with a bindi mark on the forehead, we were then taken to the lounge for a welcome drink and did the check in.   The room (352) was very beautiful and with a very nice view of the sea and the Gateway to India.  The housekeeping service is amazing. Very efficient. They even send the housekeeping manager to check if you are happy and if your need anything.   The breakfast is also fantastic. Great variety and service. And a great room.   The pool and pool area are very nice and the person who is in charge there was very helpful and"
We had afternoon tea here and it was the best afternoon tea I've had (and I've had a few).  The staff couldn't have been more welcoming even though we weren't dressed smartly.  The food was fantastic. There is a buffet with savoury and desserts and you can get as much food as you want. They also bring sandwiches and scones to your table.  This was a real treat at the end of our time in India and very reasonably priced.  A definite must if you are in Mumbai. 
"Had two luxury grande sea view rooms (connecting) in the Palace wing and stayed here over Christmas 2014.  Watching the documentary on BBC had given us high expectations and we were not at all disappointed.  The history of the hotel is amazing and service was truly above-and-beyond.  No request was too small, including a request while poolside to procure a deck of playing cards (which were retrieved from a nearby store).  The rooms were very comfortable, always serviced promptly, and various treats left for us by the staff.  Only regret is that we could not have stayed longer and continued to be pampered."
"My wife and I stayed from 22nd to 26th of Dec 2014 at the Palace Wing. When we arrived, we were taken to the Palace Wing to check in, Check in was done swiftly and we sat in the lounge while the Butler did all the formalities. We were given welcome drinks and and couple of minutes we were escorted to our room. Our room was beautifully decorated with balloons and a welcome cake.. It was very touching the efforts Taj made for us despite a super peak season. A special thanks to Chetan and Raju our room attendant. We very much appreciate your kind gestures to make our stay so special and memorable.  The bed is extremely comfortable and we requested for more firmer pillows, and was sent in minutes. There was sufficient water bottles, room service was prompt, bathroom is large and"
"This is one of the world's classic hotels. The rooms in the historic section are large and beautiful. The bathrooms very modern and well appointed. Be prepared to walk a distance to your room, but the walk is worth it.  The spa was superb. The service excellent. Proves, but you pay for what you get."
"This is by far the most enjoyable and comfortable hotel that I have stayed in. The hotel is all about old charm, character and exceptional service. The rooms are comfy, the building is beautiful, the location is great.... And the food is incredible. "
"My family and I made sure to make a three night stay here at the end of our India holiday. I will readily admit that I am not a dispassionate observer when it comes to this hotel. It is the hotel that both my grandfather and father aspired to be able to afford to visit when they were poor students at the nearby university. My father made it possible for me to visit aged four in 1970, again in 1977 and 1990 and now it was my turn to do the same for my children. Its history, the beauty of its (original) building and the famous service are the reason why this hotel is so busy and why i will always prefer it to any other in Mumbai. When you add the fact that its staff took such care of their guests on that terrible night in 2008 and that Tata has spent such care in restoring the"
"After visiting the Gateway we entered for having a high tea in the Taj for Rs 1500 per person. This is on the first floor. We were asked to wait outside on the stairs for a while, because the place was packed.  Luckily we received a window seat with view over the bay and the gateway in the sunset.  From the window we saw the decorated horse carriers passing by The buffet for the tea service was very large, including hot meals. All the cakes and chocolates and other delicious bites we tried until we could eat no more. A once in a while interesting experience, and not so good for the digestive system, i think."
This is probably one of the most iconic hotels in the world and what a fantastic place. Everything was perfect and the staff extremely accommodating. Memories of cocktails in the Harbour bar will last for years.
Great hotel  with good service. Busy at weekend breakfast and service was a bit chaotic. Suggest eating outside by the pool where the service was much better.  Take a historic tour around the hotel but make sure you have at least 1 hour!
"Everyone should have the opportunity to experience the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel . It is heaven where all the guests are remembered and treated like Royalty. They say that a Guest is God and you get that impression which makes you feel very special! My room had a balcony looking over the Gateway to India. Everything happens there. The pool, the restaurants, reception, the staff are just perfect. Do not miss Viren's tour of the building and its history. This is the highlight of the day at 5pm.  informative, and great entertainment. This was my third visit and i can't wait to return."
Prior to staying here we had stayed at 3 other Taj hotels. It is difficult to believe that this is a Taj property.We arrived a little after 7pm on the night before New Years eve. Our rooms had been booked for at least 6 months. Check in took over half an hour and it was then another 20 minutes before our luggage found it's way to our rooms. According to the hotel this was because they were trying to find us 2 rooms near each other. Surely 2 rooms near each other should have been allocated to us at the regular check in time in the afternoon and they shouldn't have needed half an hour to find them at 7pm. The problem with getting our luggage was apparently caused by it being sent to the wrong rooms. I've been interested to read that there is some sort of special welcome as we
I had the privilege of seeing this amazing place from the Taj group which also reminds us of the terrorist attack which made me even more wanting to make it a must visit place in mumbai though my trip was short. It is one of the amazing hotels from the Taj group and the hotel is so huge and greatly maintained that inspite of the memories from past attack this place is still one of the best hotels in Mumbai and may be pan India.
"Taj has two parts old and new. We were in old. Take into account reading this review we were there at one of the bussiest times of the year: new years eve. Check in was absolutely hectic with staff stressed. I would say skip the standard welcome procedure with paint and flowers. With so many people to check-in, it lost its honesty and became almost industrialized.  Our room was a big disappointment. Due to extreme humity in the room it had a terrible smell and aircon. did not work properly. Although terrible when it happens to you these things happen. What makes the difference is how hotels deal with it. In our case that was very poor. Finally at 1 am we were moved. The high occupancy escelated to all kinds of inconveniences/; try to have breakfast all at the same time.. or"
"It is the best hotel in Mumbai and we had an awesome experience here. We stayed here for 1 night as a stopover for catching our flight back home. Starting right from the check-in to escorting and showing us the room around, everything was amazingly comforting. We also took the Taj Heritage tour in the evening where they show the guests around the hotel telling them the finer points from its 111 years history. It was an experience like never before in a hotel. The room was very spacious and had a direct view of the Gateway of India. The hotel staff made each and everyone feel special even though the hotel was packed to the hilt due to busy holiday season. The variety and service at the breakfast table was as usual the signature Taj style.  I would specially like to mention Ms."
"Well what can i say.   A perfect place with beautiful interior, everything and anything can be arranged to meet your needs.  Service was delivered well, comfortable, relaxing, luxurious.   Unfortunately i had an early flight so i missed breakfast and the take away breakfast bag they arranged for me was disappointing, but that was the only downfall i had.  Other than that id definitely go back.  Theres no other place in mumbai that can compete with Taj."
"We stayed for two nights at Taj Palace Hotel in Mumbai and got a really good price for a room in the old Palace Wing. Besides the strange feeling that the hotel was bombed in 2008, the Palace Wing is so incredible beautiful with lots of arts and you get the feeling to be 100 years back in history. Tea Time and Cocktail hour in the Palace Lounge are very nice. The food is incredible expensive, probably the reason why the rooms are quite reasonable... For a prawn curry with 5 (!) prawns, you pay 25 Dollars. The rooms in the Palace Wing moreover have a little bit of a musty smell. Probably there is still water in the walls after the bomb attacks in 2008. Our first room smelled like mould, my husband had an allergy, so that we asked for changing room after one night. Staff was very"
"When you talk about the Taj Mahal Palace, there are only two words in the world to describe it...... OUTSTANDING SERVICE! You get top quality service from the moment you step into the hotel. We were received at the reception, taken to the lounge and served a drink while the check-in documents were processed. We were pleasantly surprised when our room got upgraded from the Tower Wing to the Palace Wing, at no extra cost. We were ushered to the room by a guest relations officer, who explained in detail, how each and every switch in the room works. Now that's what I call service. When I drew the curtains and opened the window, I was directly facing the Arabic Sea and The Gateway of India. What more can you ask for a view. The bed was very comfortable and you have an executive table"
"The Taj Mahal Palace. Name itself is so grand. I had got a chance to visit it once when i was in Mumbai. I decided to get a feel of this place (the heritage, architecture, food, ambiance etc.). The view of the hotel is really magnificent.  Stunning piece of beauty,I really marvelled at the design. Okay coming to food. I didnt order much to eat. Rates were very high. I had just ordered for a cup of coffee, faluda and some snacks. Coffee@350 doesn't give you that good taste honestly. Filter coffees @25 taste much much  better. I haven't quite looked at the other menus and dont know how they taste. So wont comment much. Staff is really courteous. I am still looking forward to a chance stay here. A must visit to see one of the India's finest hotel."
"This was our first hotel in India and was a great place to stay for 3 days. The location was great, the room was good and staff were friendly. The highlight of my stay was the meal at Marasal Kraft which was too die for!"
"we had an unpleasant experience during breakfast. Asked for a table outside and thinking it was cleared for us and having asked twice by the staff Rohan to be patient we did so. Suddenly we see two white ladies coming to that table and been allowed to take it.   And we stood there waiting and were left embarrassed.  People around were looking at us and we felt stupid. The White ladies had already got a table then why were we told that were waiting for one. We should have been informed that there were other people still waiting. Then at breakfast inside the Shamia or whatever restaurant, the choice was not great.  Novotel Juhu does it 10 times better. Too busy too many managers and not enough people on hands. We ask for one paratha which took ages and finally we ended up with two"
"I have not been back to Mumbai for awhile.  Anyway, I stayed in old wing and the rooms were renovated nicely.   Probably now the Taj at its best.  The poolside area is still one of the nicest place to relax and hang out.  Good service and good food."
"We arrived in the middle of the night. Check in was fairly speedy and we were shown to our really comfortable room in the heritage wing. Seems we had two options for breakfast: the Sea Lounge or Shamiana. We tried out the Sea Lounge the first morning:  it was just okay -- we had to wait to be seated (everyone seems to want to sit at the windows overlooking the Gate of India) and were then shown to a sort of annex which was a bit hot and stuffy; buffet was limited and not very exciting. Shamiana was a far better choice for breakfast in our opinion -- no view, but an extensive buffet of tasty Indian and Western options and attentive waiters. One evening we treated ourselves to a very memorable (but pricey) meal at the Souk. A fabulous waiter guided us through the menu and made"
"I stayed at this hotel for a short family holiday. All Taj properties are known for their hospitality, and this one - perhaps the most famous of all Taj properties in India - is no exception.   The hotel is a great blend of heritage and modern luxury. The effort to preserve small things from the time hotel was constructed - building itself, decor, door keys, while not compromising on safety and luxury is great. The staff was very cordial and helpful as well.   The sea facing rooms have great view, but command a premium."
The Taj Mahal palace needs no introduction! A landmark and scenic. with the the two taj buildings standing erect in front of the Arabian sea and adding to the scenery the Gateway. The lobby is magnificant! It's sheer beauty ignites your Taj experience!
We went to the Taj as a family and it is absolutely breathtaking. The shops/ gallery was very interesting as the displays were artistic and great to look at. Not to mention the gorgeous products. We had a round of drinks that made were made wonderfully and the service was good. Bathrooms were also great with a service person available. 
"My friends & I had been traveling through India for 2 weeks, and had stayed in Taj properties in Delhi, Goa, and Udaipur....however, the Taj in Mumbai was just so far above & beyond every other hotel we stayed in.  We were traveling as a group of 80, and the hotel somehow accommodated us all - they set up private happy hours for us in their bar, set up AV for us to show a highlight reel of our trip, and much more.  The hotel itself is super luxurious.  Beautifully decorated lobby, gorgeous pool area where you can have your breakfast, and amazing architecture throughout.  The rooms were really big (every room had double beds, plus a couch, coffee table, writing table, tv, etc), and every night when we got back to the room, housekeeping left rose petals in nice shapes around the"
"What a place to stay at.... One of my most memorable stay... Words can't express the comfort level extended by the HTL & all their staff members is worth a note... All facilities are top most... Breakfast venue super with the view of the pool, even the staff members remember the type of breakfast you like & make sure they provide it, without you even getting up... Such excellent service not seen anywhere... Not to miss the Heritage tour every evening offered to HTL guests.... It's all abt the history of the HTL & worth every minute of your time... Would definitely stay back... It's just awesome to unite yourself with history...."
"The Taj Mahal palace needs no introduction! A landmark and scenic. with the the two taj buildings standing erect in front of the Arabian sea and adding to the scenery the Gateway. The lobby is magnificant! It's sheer beauty ignites your Taj experience! The staff is no doubt friendly and jumps up to answer all your queries! The hotel is so grand that you could actually get lost. To be honest, you might want to end up in that maze, the beauty!  My culinary experience was in the sea lounge. Perfection indeed! Each and Every thing ensures that you experience the heritage! literally everything! What should also be noticed that the aroma around the hotel, fantabulous! I cherished my my visit and would like to experience the TAJ every time I visit Mumbai!"
We've really enjoyed our Christmas at Taj. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Our room in the tower was beautiful and very well taken care off. Best of all we liked staff's  very service-minded nice attitude. We felt very welcome and are going to stay there on every occasion. Certainly can recommend to everyone who wants to have good time in Mumbai.
"ahh the scent and flavour of heritage India - this hotel is sheerly beautful, luxurious and filled with real and gracious service. We stayed in the Heritage wing - the old Taj - wonderful architecture and a source of wonder around each corner - paintings and pottery, carved chests and hand made luscious fabrics - cushions, cloths and curtains. Courteous helpful staff (who truly DO anticipate your every wish). Lovely views of the busy harbour and fascinating side strees, and rooms which are spacious, light and again full of charm. We wandered the corridors with great delight and had delicious afternoon tea and later cocktails.   just outside is the sea wall and promenade - food and chai cooked in tiny stalls - a riot of colour, and the procession of India. So very much to do in"
"Clear winner in service , great staff - that's their strength  Lovely ambience and has a great history Location - th best Mumbai can offer  I stayed from 18th to 21st dec and every moment was worth it .  Highly recommended !  "
Nice restaurants in old taj and new taj also nice shopping boutiques nice rooms and coffee shops centrally located I would recommend to stay in old taj chinese Indian Italian lebanese Japanese restaurants all under 1 roof
"We stayed at the Taj for 2 nights from Dec 20 before setting off to Cochin and will be staying again on New Year's Eve before flying home on New Year's day. Before leaving home, we had watched a series of programmes about the Taj on the BBC - ok, it was basically a total of 4 hours of commercial airtime for the hotel but it helped set the scene in terms of expectations and we were very excited as this was exactly our type of hotel - we have had the privilege of staying at similar ""Grande Dame"" properties such as Raffles, the Peninsula (Hong Kong), the Danieli, Reid's Palace, the St. Regis in Rome and so on and we love the splendour of the architecture, the rich history and the superb service.  First impressions of the Taj were excellent - we had booked a Club room with a sea"
"The motto and ethos of this hotel is guest is god. Every member of staff at this hotel goes out of their way to make you, the guest feel special and important. The hotel is saturated in history and every corner you turn reveals another piece of the life of the hotel.  We just couldn't get enough of it and each day was like a jigsaw puzzle. The staff are on hand to offer their help and guidance at all times. Like the hotel itself they all have such interesting stories to tell.  The food was outstanding, it was obvious that the same care and attention to detail is a considered value that is at the heart of the Taj. The standards at this hotel are placed very high.  This is a hotel at the top if its game, the staff live and breathe the Taj ethics and as a guest we were hooked. We"
"I stayed at this property twice on a recent trip, both times in the palace section.  The property and rooms are beautiful and very comfortable.  First time the service was outstanding, second time they seemed understaffed and overwhelmed.  24 hour coffee service didn't work well, and when I tried getting a cup of coffee to take back to the room I was told I couldn't take the coffee out of the coffee shop."
"I booked a palace side room based on reviews & was surprised with an upgrade at check-in. We received a suite with privileges of tea and happy hour in the lounge.   I think that gave our trip an extra sprinkle of luxury...the suite was beautiful and spacious w/2 full baths, high ceilings, nice furniture, and floor to ceiling windows.  I loved going for high tea; it was so relaxing. The bed was really comfortable and the linens/pillows plush. Our whole stay was relaxing.   Even if we stayed in our original room, I would have a rave review (the view in that room was beautiful, I asked to see it before I left). Breakfast every morning shared that view of the sea dotted with boats and the India Gate.  Great options of both western and Indian items. The fresh juices were delicious"
"It's one of our all time favourite hotels. Have seen it change for the good & bad over the years. A lot has changed but the only thing still remaining is the warmth that one feels/gets during the stay. The rooms & room service are excellent. The restaurants are top notch as well except maybe the 24hr coffee shop-Shamiana, it leaves a lot to be desired.There is plenty of other great eating options around the taj. It's certainly a great experience. Hope it remains one always."
"The definition of five star. Truly an elegant and luxurious experience.  You get what you pay for so no surprise on the super high price tag. The staff was fantastic and attentive. Details were impeccable, rose petals and turn down service. Lovely retreat from the hecticness of the city! "
"We had been very interested in this hotel due to its history and particular location. Nothing disappointed! Smooth checkin (arriving late) and a fantastic room. Excellent service all around- housekeeping, restaurant staff, pool attendant and concierge. Everyone was so pleasant and attentive, but never overbearing. We stayed in the palace section and had a balcony overlooking a waterfall and memorial to the terrorist victims. Also a fabulous view of the Gateway to India. Brilliant start to our holiday. Very nice touch is that they recently included free wifi- limited for streaming but worked great for us (was able to keep up with BBC radio 4): rare for 5 star Indian hotels to go this and definitely puts them above their competitors. Simply put, if you stay in this hotel it will"
"I was thrilled to unexpectedly end up in a room in the Palace.  Wonderful room, delightful staff, fabulous staircase and dome. I loved every second I stayed there and miss it already!  Beautiful large swimming pool, and a wide range of places to eat at eye-watering prices....but you get what you pay for, so I treated myself.  Breakfast in the sea lounge was a delight with a view of the Gate of India every morning."
"The thought was itself exciting to spend two nights in Taj Palace- heritage building and the most prestigious hotel of India. Reception and Indian welcome was excellent but it took more time to allot room. Room service was also slow. Hotel did not provide dental kit, shaving kit and whenever we called for any services, it was slow. But staff was all smiling and very courteous. Sauna and steam bath rooms were of less size whereas there was no sauna bath for ladies. The weighing machines at Gym and sauna rooms were not operating. Breakfast at ground floor was superb but it was miserable at first floor on sea side. Space was less and queue was long, staff was not able to handle properly. So we could not have breakfast on first floor.  Overall stay was very good, comfortable sleep"
"We live in Mumbai itself. However, for our anniversary, my wife decided to suprise me with a stay at the Taj Mahal Palace - Palace Wing. The booking process apparently was very helpful. Once we arrived there, they had our room ready and also another option (club room), in case we wanted a higher floor. We opted for the one they had ready. It was beautifully decorated with balloons and flowers all over. The room itself is quite spacious and undoubtedly luxurious. The bathroom is in lovely white marble with a separate bath and shower. The view from the room opens to the Gateway and the Sea - with little boats bobbing on them. We decided to dine at the hotel itself. Highly recommend the Sea Lounge for breakfast and high tea. Also, dinner at Souk was wonderful. Overall, a day made"
When we decided to visit Mumbai as part of our journey across India The Taj Mahal hotel was already at the forefront of our mind of where we wanted to stay. Aside from the guest is god philosophy (which admittedly is very refreshing) the hotel offers an array of history and a true feeling of the Indian heritage. I would recommend fitting in time to take the complementary hotel tour.
We spent two nights amazed at the quality of this place . Location was good and the hotel itself was excellent. Great room and very accommodating staff. We will stay there again. Truly magnificent....
"The ultimate in understated luxury and elegance. After a two hour ride from the airport the moment you enter the the hotel you are welcomed like a special guest and made to feel special throughout. Satish the concierge is mine of useful information. Viren D'sa the Taj tour guide was very entertaining and gave a master class in the history of Taj and India, he is a star in the making. The Golden Dragon Chinese restaurant is a must visit, be careful the portions are big. The other Taj restaurants are equally great. We stayed for for 5 days and had a great stay. As always all the staff were very attentive. Ultimate service."
"This hotel certainly deserves its reputation as one of the best hotels in the world. We were treated like royalty, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is an oasis of calm and a wonderful escape from the chaos that is Mumbai. every member of staff was wonderful as were all the facilities  too. I can't wait to return."
"I spent a week in the Taj Mahal Palace for a business conference and I was absolutely blown away. My flight only arrived in Mumbai at 1am local time and by the time we where at the hotel is was past 3am. Despite the late hour, all of the staff were still alert and attentive, quickly taking care of our checkin and getting us up to our rooms.  The rooms are impecable and the daily servicing keeps them spotless.  All of the meals I had were great (inside tip: Have breakfast at the Sea Lounge rather than the main resturant for a more relaxed setting and more attentive service).  The small touches like complimentary shoe shinning and geniun care from the staff help push the hotel above and beyond the expected.   I would definitely visit again in a heartbeat."
"We felt the true meaning of being welcomed. Love this hotel. From the moment you arrive special care is taken with making you feel at home. Everyone addresses you by your name. The reception and lobby are beautiful. Our receptionist took us to our room and explained the history of the hotel to us. It's magnificent. We dined in the Masala Kraft restaurant, it was lovely. The food was a bit mild for me (catering for international palates) and the waiter came back with a deliciously spicy meal for us. Loved the effort they took to cater for our needs. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. Every time we went back to our room there was a surprise or a gift. Breakfast was lovely, we had a table over looking the Gateway to India. For me it was 7star. Service second to None."
"I liked excellent service, good food and good selection restaurants, cafe's and sightseens nearby. Only drawback that it is location at end of peninsula, so during rus hours it takes hours to get other areas of Mumbay, there is no subway so south."
"We spent just one night at this hotel and the experience was the best. Early check-in at no cost. Incredible restaurant by the pool. Five starts in all senses. They even allowed us to use the spa facilities after check-out, which was really nice just before heading to the airport at midnight. Lots of world class restaurants to choose from."
"We loved staying at the Taj Mahal palace in Mumbai. It was our last night in India and we wanted to splash out and stay somewhere luxurious. . The service was absolutely impeccable and the environment is lovely. The lobby and restaurants are beautiful and the rooms were clean and very comfortable.... the life in Mumbai is very fast,, so  enjoyed.."
Located bang opposite the Gateway of india n overlooking the Arabian sea this hotel has majecti views n its structure is steeped in history. 5star hotel n very luxurious with prompt n courteous staff. Great food too in d inhouse restaurants.  Ur gonna love every minute of ur stay.
This is one of the best hotels in the world and I know why. The staff were so lovely and courteous. Nothing was a problem for them. They were there at every turn. It really was like staying in a palace. I felt like I was on the Titanic.  I could not fault anything and recommend it highly. Very reasonable in price as well.
"An amazing experience. Pure luxury and in the perfect location. Stunning swimming pool, excellent bars and restaurants, beautiful poolside breakfast area with a vast choice of food from around the world. My favourite place!"
"My wife and I have just returned to our home in Scotland from a week of absolute bliss at The Taj. This beautiful hotel just cannot be faulted.  We received a warm welcome and personal check in to our Club King Room with sea view in the Palace wing. The room was spotlessly clean, spacious, with a very comfortable bed and the view from the window was breathtaking.The staff were very helpful and polite in all areas and made us feel very special. We look forward to visiting India again and would not hesitate to stay in the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel."
"... having lived in NYC and working near the plaza hotel, I couldn't resist such an iconic opportunity. My wife didn't know I booked the Taj, and when we pulled up at 1am her jaw dropped. We spent 3 magnificent days in the ""old section"" which had a great mix of traditional architecture and modern comfort. My wife commented everyday that this was the best hotel experience ever. The staff was constantly doting on us, the breakfast over looking the water or the pool were equally wonderful. To come so far and not stay here would be a shame, even for budget travelers. "
"It was a lot of fun to stay at this classic old  hotel. Our room overlooked the Gateway to India. The service in the hotel was excellent. It was fun just of sit in the lobby and ""people watch"".... Lots of families from the Emirates. They have a tour of the hotel every day.....don't miss it. The location is within walking distance of  lots of good restaurants.  The pool is very nice. Breakfasts were good. We stayed in the newer part of the hotel. I think that you have to request and probably pay more to stay in the old part. I may try to do that if I returned."
"We found the Taj to be one of the most comfortable, characterful, charming and charismatic  hotels we have ever stayed in. It really is up there with the best in the world. The staff and service were wonderful, our gorgeous 4th floor sea view room in the old part of the hotel was sumptuous and the facilities were second to none. 'Yes' we struggled with eating beautiful food and sipping fine wine in superb surroundings in the knowledge that within 100 metres impoverished mothers and children were bedding down for the night on the side of the street but we convinced ourselves that by staying there and tipping well, we were keeping a raft of staff in employment and putting food on the plates of their families. We would heartily recommend splashing out on the Taj to those who can"
"This was the first time I have ever been in India and I was in Mumbai for business. Two colleagues and I arrived at the Taj at 2 a.m. after a long flight from HK. We were treated to a traditional welcome ceremony, which seemed a bit over the top at 2 a.m., but we appreciated the effort. The hotel is breathtaking. The service is impeccable. The rooms are spacious and beautiful. We only had breakfast meetings in the hotel in the Sea Lounge, which was fantastic. There are fun shops in the hotel to purchase tradition Indian items.  My only complaint is there is no where to get a simple cup of coffee!! Everything is over the top elegant.  It is truly a utopia in the midst of an extremely chaotic city. In fact, having never been to India, stepping outside of this hotel and facing the"
"The service in this hotel is impeccable, the rooms are good and reasonably priced for a high end hotel. The food is pricey a cheese sandwich is over £14 but you cant expect to stay in a hotel like this and pay any less. The whole experience from the minute you book with courtesy emails etc is brilliant. The history of this hotel is so interesting you nearly do not have to venture out to sight see in Mumbai! (This might be exactly what you want!)"
"we started our recent trip to India by staying at the Taj in Mumbai. Our suite was very comfortable and the excellent staff looked after us extremely well. Although we only stayed for two days, it was a great way to start a journey. Great hotel, with excellent restaurants and a wonderful atmosphere. We stayed in the.."
Shamiana served us the most memorable Mutton Curry. This exceeded far more that our expectation. Highly recommended to order the Mutton Curry with Potatoes. Though the Buffet spread was exotic we preferred to order from the Menu and we were blessed. Kudos!! Excellent !!
"I recommend anyone who is in for the royal treatment to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, India. It is simply heaven on earth. I have never been spoiled so rotten in my entire life - from the very friendly welcome that was made so smooth to the attention and affection given by the staff - whether at breakfast, lunch or dinner in one of the hotel's restaurants or as room service. Housekeeping was impeccable - bringing all kinds of treats to my room such as the ingredients for a facial masks and for a luxurious footbath. Even bangles, bindi and a scarf for the wedding of a friend that I am here to attend. I can't wait to be back. Only next time, I am staying much longer!"
"I recently had a one week music performance tour in three cities in India ending up in Mumbai at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. What a great way to end the week. The staff could not have been more attentive and helpful. The facilities are all top notch, rooms are impeccable and the restaurants fantastic. I only ate in the main restaurant but it was great. Excellent breakfast with Indian and Western selections and poolside tables are available. The pool area is a lush, green, comfortable environment and the spa was first class and relaxed. Being there is a much needed escape from the reality of the streets outside and I agree with ""Jokeswithoakes"" review in that you do feel happy that you are in this oasis of luxury.      The area is a tourist area so there are people who try take"
"We stayed here overnight whilst on our honeymoon in India.  Could not fault any part of the stay whatsoever.  The staff cannot be more accommodating.  Sea View room in the Palace wing was lovely, fantastic view of the Gateway to India.  Room was decorated with balloons and lovely flower arrangements at no extra cost to us.  Pool area was lovely, Harbour bar was great, try the 1933 cocktail with a little tale from the barman, and the breakfast was lovely.  Just an amazing hotel, fantastic in every way."
"Staying at the Taj Palace Mumbai is all about taking in the luxury of the place. With a great history and few of the best restaurants in Mumbai, Taj is really the pinnacle of luxury hotels.  The room we stayed in was really furnished well. With pure Italian marble, a tub and rainfall shower and a nice view of the bay, the room was perfectly adorned. The surround sound with the TV provided good entertainment such as one finds at home. The staff was courteous as expected and one of the managers even provided us some items which we casually talked about. I have tasted food at the Shamiana and Golden Dragon restaurants and it surely can be rated amongst the best food I have had.  I would recommend anyone staying at the hotel to join the hotel tour which lasts about an hour. It helps"
"Every part of the hotel is just brilliant. Ask for the seaview palace rooms for the true feel of this property.   Dined at Wasabi and Soux, both are brilliant ! Service is the beyond what you can ask for."
"The short review is that this hotel is wonderful and that you should go.   My slightly longer review; we finished three weeks in India with a couple of days here, and it was utterly perfect. The rooms are gorgeous, the food is sublime, the pool area and spa facilities (which were much needed when I had a late flight the day I checked out) are perfect.   Every guest in this hotel quite rightly feels like a king, and hence are all walking around looking quite pleased with themselves. I normally despise these sorts of people, but I was so happy here that I joined them in planting a self-satisfied smirk on my face and having a really great time. x"
"What a perfect way to end our 10-day tour of the Taj and Rajasthan.  Spent the whole first night and next day just pampering myself over a lovely breakfast, then the spa, the gym, followed by sunning at the pool.  Totally in my element. Great service across the board.  Hands down.  Nice wine selections, the steam room in the spa is set at the perfect temperature.  Great gym.  The guy at the pool knew exactly where to sit me based on where the sun would shift in the hour.  Yes.  All this makes for a very pleasant stay. Rooms are great.  A bit old and outdated, like the hallways leading to them. Reminds you that more seniors are staying in the joint than young people.  Oh well.  Still beats Bombay's alternatives, I'm guessing. Did not eat at the hotel other than breakfast. "
I was staying here for my 1st night of wedding. The Hotel is known for its location & more over the history.This is India's oldest hotel 111 yrs to be precise. The hotel has a very classic feel to it. & if you staying in one of the rooms facing the sea the sunrise see is amazing. The over all service is amazing of this hotel. Infact its one of their USP's i can say. The Hotel has also got some world class restaurant like WASABI(one of the best rated restaurant in asia). Now the only drawback is that it gets a little crowded as its one of the main attraction & a lot of people are in the lobby & else where in the hotel who are not staying at the hotel.
"You could almost visit Mumbai, never leave this hotel, and have a wonderful time. The building is a masterpiece, the service perfect, the view of the gate riveting and there are four restaurants, We tried the Lebanese, and dined at the poolside one night. Our stay in Mumbai was memorable even if we did leave the hotel. "
"Stayed here for one night on our way home from touring India, this is the most wonderful hotel, superb rooms, decor and facilities, greeted on arrival with towels and a refreshing drink, taken to an outstanding room overlooking India gate, restaurants are superb, only regret is that it was for only one night, I will be back."
"What a hotel, what a service, waht an experience in Bombay.... They really know how to take care of the guests. Room, Lobby, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner everything was perfect. Will definetly stay at Taj Palance again when visiting Bombay."
" What a hotel, it is simply stunning, from walking in to leaving, you feel very special being able to visit there, I wish we could of stayed the night!     We had a very lovely afternoon tea, the views were delightful and it was a real treat to have a window seat.    The food was excellent, a very good selection of indian food, which you helped yourself to.    The service was a tad slow and we had to keep asking again and again for things, but the chap was quite busy and did have 4 tables to deal with.   I definitely would visit here when you're not in a rush, this would be to allow for the time of the service, and to also enjoy the atmosphere.   A very lovely afternoon, would visit again, as it is very value for money. "
"We stayed in the hotel for three nights and had a wonderful time. The food and service was really, really good. Room was a nice calm place to come back to after exploring the city. But what stood out most was the friendliness of the staff. They make the Taj Mahal Hotel the special place it is."
"The name of the hotel inspired me to try the Indians legacy. .to melt in the traditional daily life of indian people.  The staff was more than excellent. ..the scenes in front of my room was spectacular, , facing the Gate of India on the Indian ocean. The restaurants were marvellous and hosting the most famous cousins. "
"I checked in to the Taj Mahal Palace last evening.  The hotel staff are gracious, the hotel room palatial, and the restaurants welcoming.  The room is on the Arabian Sea side so it can be noisy because Mumbai has continuous traffic.  I was able to sleep comfortably.  Breakfast in the Sea Lounge was excellent.  The omelet was made with fresh eggs and cheese.  The croissant was as good as any I have had in Paris."
"This hotel is a s near to perfection as you can get.  If you want to be pampered and feel like royalty this is the place to stay.  I can still smell the scent of the lobby, see the beautiful flower displays, taste the exquisite food and dearly miss the impeccable service received from every single member of staff.  And the world's most comfortable beds."
"Fantastic, historic, amazing.  Love this place.  The service is impeccable.  If you can, stay in the old section as opposed to the newer tower.  Breakfast was included with our rate and the breakfast buffet is one of the best I have ever seen.  The room was spacious and the amenities top notch."
"We only had a day in Mumbai so just wanted to have a drink in the hotel. There is no doubt it is beautiful and has a lovely 'cool' vibe as soon as you enter it. We went to the Sea Lounge on the 1st floor expecting something pretty special after watching the BBC  prog recently which featured this. It was quite a shock to find the service was next to non-existent - slow, and very very surly. And when our smoothies did arrive they were thin and not even chilled. In spite of this we left the waiter a tip (yep, british, we can't help it!) - he snatched it, rammed it in his back pocket and didn't even look at us. We won't be returning."
This hotel is the oldest in Mumbai and is spetacular. Most room are overlooking the Gateway of India. You are a 5 minute walk from the famous Cafe Leopold.   The staff cannot do enough for you.  The restaurants and bars are all fabulous looking - we ate in the Masala Kraft... we ordered the 5000 rupee menu that meant we sat next to a cooking area where the chef cooked most of the meal in front of us and explained everything he was doing along with the spices he used.
"The best of the best, we had a 6 night stay at the Taj in early september to get to visit mumbai before travlling around indian for 5 weeks it was one of the best hotels i have stayed in anywhere, the staff could not do enough for you the food in all the restaurants was perfect cant wait to come back"
"This is a superb property. From the minute we checked in (a lovely process including receiving a ""lei"" type necklace and a lovely cup of tea in the lounge - to the rooms, to the views, to the service in every part of the hotel - it is a WONDERFUL place to stay. Great selection of restaurants. Breakfast by the pool each morning was sublime. Lovely art work - they will do a private tour just to look at the art if you ask. They offer a hotel tour - well worth it. I highly, highly recommend this property."
"If time permits, I like to visit Taj Palace whenever I am  in Mumbai, have stayed there many years back, and do visit for Breakfast, lunch or dinner whenever possible. This is one of the best hotels in India especially in Mumbai. The food is sumptuous and service is excellent. It is expensive, but well worth the price you spend. The attitude of the staff is very friendly at reception and all sections of the hotel. It is beyond comparison with other hotels, the best of its kind."
"The Taj. The name says it all. Service excellence comes to mind. This was our first stay at thus establishment. The moment we stopped at the hotel we were made to feel like royalty. The personal or should I say individual attention to detail  by the staff places this establishment way above the rest.  Without request our room was upgraded and the view of the ""Gateway of India"" was indeed a delightful sight from the room window.If I were to critisize I would have to say the abscence of a bidet was missed.  "
"I was a guest here at the end of August 2014. I was in the area for business and this hotel was reccomended for a long weekend stay. I attended a private party held at the hotel and stayed 3 additional nights. The party itself was very nice. Good food, good service from the party staff.  I had a club level room facing the pool on the 5th or 6th floor -- I can't remember.   The view was fantastic and I loved the room. The TV in the bathroom mirror was very cool! Even the hallways smelled like lemon mint.   The Sea View lounge had a great breakfast -- very fresh! I also loved the evening snacks and drinks in the club lounge. Afternoon tea was also delicious.   I did use the salon services and they weren't up to my standards. I had probably the worst manicure I have ever paid for."
"So I wanted to surprise my folks and take them out for the weekend for a change, far away from the drudgery of the real world. And in my quest to give them the perfect weekend getaway, I figured instead of travelling all the way out of the city, to take them somewhere within city limits instead. And that's how the Taj sojourn began.  During our check-in, I got a surprise myself, we were upgraded to one of the Palace suites, seven levels above the room I had booked for the weekend(When good things happen to you, one should never ask, ""why?""). And once we were shown the way to the exclusive lounge for palace suite residents and then later got to the elevator with a private-key access to the suite floors, we realized we were in for a special treat. And boy, what a treat t'was!  The"
"My husband and I stayed here as part of our wedding anniversary trip around India, and found it absolutely faultless. As a Gold Taj Club member I was upgraded to a suite, which was wonderfully comfortable and attractive. We were given all sorts of treats as it was an anniversary - including heart-shaped balloons in the room, fresh flowers and cake. What most bowled us over though was the impeccable service & communication between staff. In so many hotels you ask one person something and it gets forgotten. Here, everyone seemed to know which restaurant we were booked into, where we were going next, what time we had to leave etc. we felt totally pampered throughout. Don't miss the Historical Walk there either. Thoroughly entertaining and enlightening!"
My girlfriend and I stayed three nights having just been in Goa for a similar period. This was my fourth time at this hotel in the last 13 years but if I had a negative comment to make it would be that the return was not recognised. Equally. the follow up email requesting feedback welcomed me 'on my first visit to the hotel'. We had a room on the 5th floor overlooking the Arabian Sea. Lovely room. Adrian our Butler was extremely polite and professional. he arranged a few things for us and it took pressure off me having him help me along. We were collected from the airport in style in one of the Hotel's Jaguars. Nice English car. Owned by Indians though! Check in was OK. Our initial room had an odour of smoke and we were relocated. The attention to detail in housekeeping is
"First , when arriving at mumbai airport take a taxi from the pre paid taxi counter. There is one on the arrivals level or one with no queue a level down. Its so simple, tell them where you are going, pay the set price,  they give you a slip and go out and get your taxi.it will take about an hour to the Taj.   The location is excellent- much better than marine drive.This is a fabulous hotel with exceptional service. Check in was the most efficient we have ever had and the welcome so friendly. We had a room in the tower as we didnt plan to spend all our time in the room after all. But would have a room in the palace next time for the experience. But every guest is treated so well whatever  room you have.  The staff here will do anything for you. And they really do want to do"
"My girlfriend and I stayed over my birthday weekend. We enjoyed every aspect of this hotel and its facilities. The staff are ever willing and as charming as you could hope. Food and drinks were excellent in the three restaurants we tried. Every detail is considered to the smallest detail. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special and at ease. The best part of this hotel is the stunning pool and garden area. We spent many happy hours sitting in the shade listening to the faint sounds of the busy city surrounding us, and feeling utterly relaxed. Although not cheap, this landmark is the best value hotel I have ever stayed in. Every moment was a pleasure."
"We were in Mumbai to celebrate our anniversary and we had booked to stay in this amazing hotel, so the best chocolate cake ever was waiting for us in our room! The location is awesome, we had great views of the Indian Gate and the sea in front of our balcony. The breakfast buffet had a wide selection of international and indian food. From the hotel you can walk to the nearest commercial street with restaurants and shops. The only thing that we did not enjoy was the massage at their spa, as they were having maintenance works in progress and the noise was unbearable."
"I had checked into Taj with my husband for his birthday surprise, and it turned out to be a fantastic idea. Loved everything. Right from the fact that our room was all decorated, the cake, the flowers, etc. We dined at Golden Dragon & the Souk and both were excellent. will definitely do this again"
"We made one mistake in booking in to the Taj Palace and that was to stay for only three nights - we will be going back for longer. On arrival we had the delight of being upgraded to a suite at no extra cost and it was just superb with a huge sitting room, dining room, big bedroom and the largest bathroom I have encountered in many years of travelling. All was exquisitely furnished and fitted and was immensely evocative of bygone eras. It was a sensational experience just to sit in those surroundings. The staff from reception onward were courteous and efficient and the young man who attended our room was outstanding in his level of attention. The interior of the hotel with its atrium and galleried rooms is beautifully maintained and we could not spot a single blemish. Artworks"
"We were fortunate enough to return to Taj Mahal Palace for a stay last month to relax for a few days before heading home.   The hotel is beautiful and it was great to experience excellent hospitality as always.   Our room was magnificent on the Club floor with a great pool view.  Except for the Club lounge and Sea Lounge, this time round we found that all the hotel bars and restaurants did lack ambience and atmosphere. The Chinese and Indian restaurant did not seem to be able to cope under pressure. The food and drink selection was excellent though.  There were a limited number of sun loungers around the pool, so it did all seem very cramped.   The hotel staff were excellent.  I had my hair coloured at £80, but they did a great job. I did book a treatment at Jiva spa, but the"
"Stayed here twice on business but also visited countless times for late evenings with friends in the Samarkhand (the old coffee shop - now gone with its tented ceilings) through the 80s and 90s. The Taj is an institution, and sitting in the lobby, you'll never cease to be amazed by the sights. Fabulous wedding parties, Bombay's beautiful people (and my god they can be beautiful!!), gigolos and con artists, jetlagged sunburned and frazzled tourists, and (with apologies) the occasional sprinting rat. All round fabulous memories."
We had the honor to spend our anniversary here and it was just amazing !! . I actually enjoyed the tour which is held everyday at 5 in the evening . The tour guide was just excellent and the history was superb .  We felt soo pampered at the hotel .. the staff is excellent . They kept redecorating our room as it was our anniversary weekend .. that was just adorable !!  The food was Yummy !! I just loved how the staff treated us !!  Would definitely come here again !!
"Stayed here for 3 nights and the hotel is lovely.  The service was good. The room was good and comfortable but not extraordinary. I was lucky as my room overlooks the sea and ""the Gateway of India"" so the view was pleasant but some of my friends stayed in rooms facing the back and they complain of the non-stop honking of the traffic behind the hotel.  The food in the restaurants (both the Chinese Restaurant and the coffee house) are good but not cheap. However, stepping into the surrounding streets is like stepping into another world where vagrants are aplenty hounding passers-by for money and you can see young children sleeping on the pavements."
"Stayed here with friends for two nights a few years ago. Recently watched the BBC 2 series of the wonderful Taj and this brought back memories of the beautiful hotel. We arrived at 6 am in the morning after a 12 hr train journey and we're not at our freshest! However we were treated with the greatest respect and made to feel special from the outset. We were offered breakfast before gaining early access to our rooms. Everything about our stay was perfect, really couldn't find fault. Would love to return someday. Highly recommend.  "
"Stayed in the iconic Tajmahal Palace Hotel with my family for 4 nights. Staying in the heritage palace wings with big rooms and bathrooms, palacely decors with fascinating furniture, was an experience we will savour for a long time. Breakfast was awesome and also the food in the restaurants. However food was really pricey. The only thing I missed was a complimentary wi-fi service."
"If you are looking for one of the best hotel experiences you'll ever have then the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is the place to come. We stayed in the main hotel and it was exceptional from the minute we arrived.  The staff are wonderful and the food is the best you'll find anywhere. Every day we were surprised by the little extras that appeared in our room. It was like fairies had visited your room and left little surprises for you - a bookmark for your book,  a lens cleaner for your sunglasses, a cord tidy for your phone charger, little notes on your pillow. I could stay here forever!! Treat yourself and stay here at least once in your life - you will not regret it."
"lovely hotel, beautiful grounds and pool area , very attentive staff. Generally really enjoyed a couple of days here....couple of observations...we booked a standard room and it was fine , nothing exceptional but perfectly fine. Small balcony a bit tatty needs a good clean and a lick of paint. Bathroom was fine but despite black marble floors the wall tiles all look a bit dated ... But this might be the intention as it is a historic property. Would recommend trying to get a high floor as on the 3rd floor the endless honking of car horns was annoying. It was lovely to stay at the Taj and tick it off....having stayed at the Oberoi too, I would probably go back to the Oberoi next time."
"Have stayed here twice for business. The hotel is excellent: beautiful building, comfortable rooms, great gym and awesome restaurants. But it's the little things that make it really special: greeting me by name, free ironing (crucial after 20-hour flight), coffee in my room every morning. Try to stay in the older section of the hotel, but I'm sure all the rooms are great."
"I returned to stay at the Taj in Mumbai after 34 years.. The hotel was as beautiful today as it was then. Apart from having  more luxury brand boutiques, everything else seemed to have stood still, unchanged, even by the horrid events it sadly went through..  Unparalleled comfort and service, excellent food served in beautiful settings and of course the iconic terrace and swimming pool. The Taj is a must if you stay in Mumbai or Bombay as it was called then. The view of the sea and the gate of India remain engraved in memory."
"This is the very best hotel I have stayed in based on service , room ,service , food , service ,pool , service , club room , service and then to top off the service you can enjoy the history of the building on your room TV and Then make sure you take part in the daily tour of the Hotel the Guide is a Shear brilliant man on the history and the guests that have stayed at this wonderful hotel."
By far one of the best hotels in the world. The Taj Mahal Palace is a glimpse back into what true service means in a hotel. I stayed in the older part of the hotel (not the Tower) and my experience started with the check in service. You are escorted to the lounge and served tea while you are being checked into the hotel and your luggage is taken to your room. The rooms are large and comfortable and have everything a traveler would want. The wifi was fast and efficient. Plenty of power outlets in the room with adapters for the various plug types.
"Upon arrival to the hotel my wife and I were aware of the fact that the management knew that it was my birthday. Thus, they kindly upgraded us to a huge suite in the heritage wing. It also gave us the free use of the club lounge. Walking in the corridors of the hotel gives you the sense of going through history. Many artifacts and majestic structure. Security is tight due to the 2008 terrorist attack, but the service rendered by everybody was of the highest level."
"Firstly this is two hotels in one - there is the Tower bock and the Palace Wing. Both of these share all the facilities and secondly this is a very large hotel, but once you have your bearings then it does seem to be reasonably compact.  We had a sea facing view room in the Palace Wing where we overlooked the Gateway to India which it quite stunning when lit up at night.  There are many restaurants in this hotel but due to our travel arrangements we were not able to try many of them.  A truly spectacular hotel although, probably due to its size, it felt a little impersonal."
"Stayed 3 nights in this gem of an hotel. Room 459 in the Palace Wing, glorious views of the Gateway of India and the little harbour  and sea. Picked up from Airport in an Executive black Jaguar, met on arrival by night duty manager who had already checked us in and accompanied us to our room. I had a sore throat and he ordered a special drink with cloves for me without me  asking for it. The service is attentive, very corteous and nothing is too much to ask for. Cleanliness of the hotel, rooms especially bathrooms are first class. Breakfast in the Sea Lounge was lovely morning experience and started the day off on the right foot. The public areas and decor of the Palace wing are stunning and have been lovingly restored to their original Edwardian Decor. This gives the visitor a"
"I'm very lucky in my work to travel to some amazing places and stay in a variety of nice hotels.  The Taj Mahal Palace is without doubt THE most amazing I have had the privilege to stay in.  I stayed in the 'old tower' and from the moment you leave your transport you are swept back to an era of elegance, tradition and above all others, unparalleled service.  Every staff member you pass has a smile and a greeting. Every corner of this magnificent property has been meticulously kept to the highest level of presentation.  Apart from the history, comfort and opulance of the hotel, which is first class, the stand out for me over any other hotel I have stayed in is the SERVICE.  Nothing is too much trouble and each and every staff member truly care that your stay is the best it can"
Had three beers at sea lonuge n lunch of thai green curry at shamiana restaurant of taj .all alone was blissful  Super courtious staff.  Over friendly warm staff Value for money I didn't like the fresh orange juice so they didn't charge for it. ..Their gestures like these touch your heart.... atleast mine did. I spent a great afternoon there while my husband was working all alone will taken care of.    
"From the moment you step inside (via the hotel security) you feel like you have arrived in an oasis of sanctity from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai (Bombay) into a world of order, luxury and decadence. There is service without being over obtrusive, quality without excess and history without the decay that permeates so much of India,We were checked in then ushered to our room with a  porter who showed us the basics of the room then left quickly, Our view over the Gateway to India was amazing and the room was well appointed. We had breakfast included in the package and indulged in really nice local Masala Dosai - a favorite from my time in India over 40 years ago and from time we spent living in Little India in Singapore. We notified the hotel ahead of arrival that this was our"
Stayed here for 2 days. Wonderful hotel. Helpful staff and the spa was great. The gym facilities  were very good. The hotel breakfast was great. Lots of choice of local and international fayre. The courtyard area is exquisite. The hotel Also conduct a daily your of the hotel and give you the history and chance to explore this gem of Bombay. 
"We were attending a conference at the Taj and arrived a few days before and stayed at the nearby Oberoi, where we were treated very specially.  We then came to the Taj with great expectations, having watched 'Hotel India'. We arrived on a Saturday of a public holiday weekend, so it was packed and the service was very disappointing when compared with the Oberio.  We had a meal at the Sea Lounge, which cost about 100 pounds which was, quite frankly, dreadful - service lack lustre, stale rolls and some spaghetti that I would expect from some local fast food restaurant. We really weren't enjoying it, but then the conference started and things changed - service good, food excellent.  So - it seems that the more you are paying, the better things will be, which is a shame. The hotel"
Was there in December 2013. Very nice luxorious hotel built in a very huge building with very long hallways (to our rooms). Also the rooms were very well furnished and new. Marble bathroom One thing I didn't like was the keys which were not like usual hotels (card key) and it was not practical because it was space consuming and you keep it in your wallet.
"The chaos of Mumbai is unmatched by any other city. Cars and buses zig-zagging through the immobile traffic. Every time you cross the road, you would be dodging taxis and motorbikes. At the centre of this commotion lies the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.   Despite this non-stop parade of noise, the Taj manages to be otherworldly. The moment you step in, time slows down and every thing is perfectly calm. The Taj has a whole range of shops to satisfy your fashion needs. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.   There is a business centre in the building where you can obtain a SIM, top up and get customer care.  If there is anything you need, speak to one of the concierges and they will sort it out.  Clearing out the room to check-out was one of the most heartbreaking things one can"
"If you like being transported to the aristocratic/colonial age of Mumbai, you will really enjoy the Taj Mahal Palace.  Excellent service and care taken for every aspect of this wonderful place. It is a beautiful hotel, with great attention to every detail of décor and service.  My room was perfect - serene, quiet with an interesting view of the busy and colorful streets below.  Pool area is very calming.  Food at poolside is OK, but service was perfect.  Across the street is the sea and the bustling life of the city.  I could have stayed for a week just soaking up the atmosphere.  I felt very safe and secure.  I hired a hotel car to take me to the airport, and the driver provided a great review of Mumbai history, culture, locations, etc (nearly 1 1/2 hours to airport !)"
Recent stayed at the hotel and every aspect of the stay was great. The position of the hotel is fantastic and having breakfast in the sea lounge looking out over the sea is a real treat. The staff provide great service and its almost as if they know what you want before you ask for it. The hotel is a real luxury and can't wait to return
"We booked this on its reputation on Tripadvisor and elesewhere, just before it became more famous through the Hotel India TV series. We reserved a sea-view club room and were upgraded on arrival to a suite facing the pool - more room, and very welcome. Our room, and the lounges as well, had some sort of air freshener which was a problem for my partner's allergies - we managed to pull out from the mains socket the dispensers in our room. We presumed they disguised the dampness, from the rather old walls. Lilies were used to decorate the lounge and other areas and they also caused discomfort. But overall the hotel is very attractive, clean and well looked after. The staff are well trained and courteous. The only glitch was in reserving a car from the hotel to the airport at the"
Very very charming. Great staff.  Delicious tea.  Definitely be careful at night though walking around.  I really wish we could afford to stay there but we actually stayed at an awesome place nearby called thrverty lounge (it has a hotel on top).
A beautiful old hotel - faded glory but kept up to date and with great service for such a large property.  The location is unbeatable and the food in all the restaurants fantastic...seriously they care about the food presented to their guests...and the afternoon tea is wonderful.  Try the old wing if you like classic and the new wing if yu prefer functional though both are excellent.
"From the airport pickup, to the reception on arrival, and right throughout, every aspect of stay can be described as genuinely warm hospitality with meticulous attention. It's not just the history, the beautiful architecture, the position and outlook, old world charm and the gracefully efficient staff, but something that makes you feel the world is a wonderful place.  We stayed in both the Coral suite and the Taj Club rooms in the Palace allowing us complimentary use of the palace lounge with hi tea, evening cocktails and canapés and a nightcap with chocolates. There was nothing that was too much trouble for our butler, such as booking restaurants, guide, confirming and printing air tickets. An example of attention to detail was finding business magazines delivered to our room,"
"Very expensive, but worth every dollar. Excellent  restaurants and boutiques located inside the hotel. The rooms are exquisite, beautiful decor throughout the hotel. The front desk ,waiters and the cleaners are all very friendly."
I was so so excited to stay here.... But All it gone in a vain. Good property but a expensive room. But rooms were small dont expect to get a big room and ok ok avg. room.  I was welcome at reception with smile and garland and was shown the room but after that who are you they hell don't care...... I was there for 2 days but real sorry to say no call or no nothing to take feedback who I am doing. Even at checkout no one cared to ask how was your stay.  Yes there preference and priority are only and only foreigners or NRI.  I had given a written feedback form and email also on service and bad experience I had but hell they dont care.  So if you want to see fake smile bad small and expensive room stay there and I assure you wont be cared.  A real turndown by TAJ MAHAL MUMBAI.  I
"Popped in as a tourist for a light lunch in the Sea Lounge. The staff were unwelcoming, did not smile and seemed to be on autopilot. Ordered a ham and cheese baguette and some tea. Unlike the Mount Nelson hotel in Capetown no one explained what the different teas might have to offer. The tea, their special blend was nothing to shout about. As to the baguette, well the bread was good but the ham thin and of poor quality and the cheese was thinly spread. All for £18 or 1800 rupees. The Taj Starbucks at the rear beats it hand drown : take my advice go there instead."
This was our second visit in three years. Whilst it was opulent it was not pretentious. It seemed busier than before but staff were attentive without being over bearing.   Breakfast by the pool was lovely as well as in the main breakfast lunch.   Particular mention to Elvis the Golden Dragon Chinese restaurant who was so helpful when we tried to order way too much food !  Also good to see the Middle front doors are back in use. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.. Again.
"I'm sure there are (deserved) 5 star reviews throughout this page, so I'll start with the reason for my 4 stars.   It's a trend that whenever you star in a deep-pocketed hotel they'll assume your goal in travelling is to run up your Visa bill, and so it is with The Taj. Airport transfer will run you about 5x the price of a taxi (rp4200 vs rp850) and wifi is charged at around US15 per day per device. Is there still a reason to charge extra for wifi in 2014?  But on with the good... The Taj exudes effortless charm - in the lobby, in the rooms and over breakfast. It's a class act and everything you hope for in a historic Indian hotel. There's a daily 5pm tour of the hotel and there's a nice 2 hour historic walk of the colonial district you can do from here. If you want shopping,"
"Truly a second home is at Taj which always makes me feel like am not away from family for a business or from my home .. It has always been a wonderful experience to be at Taj anytime .. I have got to learn the true meaning of hospitality from all the team members starting from reception desk to the duty manager, concierge, restaurant manger or else any one starting from well coming till check out, it has always been inspiring to know the management of Taj team.. Truly worth staying at Taj .."
"I was treated to two nights here for my birthday as a surprise but ended up staying for 3 as we really didn't want to leave. After watching 'Hotel India' in the UK I had formed such high expectations of the place & I am so happy that they were greatly exceeded.   We were fortunate enough to stay in a Palace room, which was stunning. We ate in the palace lounge, the sea lounge, Souk & the pool side restaurant. The palace lounge is beautiful & if you have a club room or a suite you get complimentary afternoon tea, free cocktails between 6.30 & 8pm in there everyday (plus more), which is a welcome addition. Souk has an incredible view of the gateway & serves up delicious Lebanese meals, so definitely a must above the other hotel restaurants.   And finally, it's the staff that make"
"Staying here was a real highlight of an otherwise rough stay in Bombay.It's a gem and a place of respite in grimy Bombay. I arrived with a major case of Bombay Belly and the staff were nothing but absolutely helpful and sympathetic (this happens to nearly everyone it seems...) There were special items on the menu for this that helped me recover. The room itself was really beautifully decorated and opulent, with a gorgeous bathroom. I didn't eat much here, but what I did have was high quality. The service was top notch all around.   The (small) con during my stay: As in other hotels around India, they spray pesticide all over to ward off mosquitos. The smell was extremely overwhelming and there was no escaping it anywhere. It might have been okay had I not been ill previously."
Its the best hotel i have ever been i love the food and service there. The area is very good and i loved the food very much  I will say that if someone gets a chance to go then they should go  The people over there are damn good
"It's hard to imagine a dame of this stature finding herself amidst the dirt and grime of Mumbai's dirt ridden streets. She rises from her foundations in splendid architecture, it's charm reminiscent of a bygone era, and when you arrive at the entrance you are met with the beautifully clad men in regalia sported in colonial days. The reception is warm and welcoming, and the Indian people being very courteous, one easily feels welcome. The interior is grand and opulent, with a pool area that will bring the most restless mind to peace. Surrounded by lush vegetation it's hard to imagine that this bastion is surrounded by millions of cars and people. It's rooms are lush and lavishly decorated with all the modern comforts imaginable. Great place to end a magnificent tour of India,"
"The Mumbai Taj Palace Hotel is an unique experience...! Wonderful building, excellent services, terrific restaurants, great atmosphere... The swimming pool and gardens are extremely charming.  In Mumbai, I doubt there is a better hotel to stay. "
"Build this 1903 ""grandeur"" today would cost a fortune. Jamsedji Tata San was ambitious and thanks to him, because this is a real beauty facing the Arabian sea.  We could just afford to take photos, but it was OK with us. According to the reviews I see that the customers are well take care and served.  Badhā'ī बधाई"
Very high class hotel. Very nice view of Gateway of India. Love staying in hotel because they are serving with Top class hospitality. Food was excellent and drinks are reasonable price. I am attaching some pictures.  U can see it yourself. heart_suitheart_suitheart_suit
"We stayed in Luxury Grand room overlooking the sea on the fourth floor, and the view was awesome. The taj hospitality is excellent and would highly recommend staying here. The heritage tour is also very well done.  Just one bad experience...they don't have a valet parking inside the hotel. My car was parked in the streets overnight and I also noticed a small dent in my car later on. Hope the management addresses this limitation.  "
"This heritage beauty looks like grand old lady of Mumbai . Despite the fact that this Hotel opened for guests in the year 1903 , what is beautiful is the preservation oh the Heritage ,the way modern facilities have been in-built offering a guest the best of both worlds .  The choice of Food served in various restaurants & the quality combined with service makes it stand among the best ,I have stayed over the last 3 Months ."
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai India for my birthday in October. We had just completed a tour thru Gate 1 Travel which was exceptional. My dream birthday was to stay at the Taj where my grandparents had stayed 60 years ago.  The hotel made me feel like a princess.  They upgraded our room to the Palace!  Our lovely housekeeper filled our room with balloons, rose petals, a beautiful bouquet, and to top it off a bubble bath filled with rose petals!  We ate in the Chinese restaurant and had Peking duck and in the Lebanese restaurant "" Souk"" and had the falafel.  Both so delicious.  Each restaurant brought me a birthday cake.  The history of the hotel is so interesting. We had the good fortune to take the hotel tour that is at 5 pm everyday.  Our  hotel tour guide"
"hi am Dipak Raut m from Nagpur , and The Taj Mahal Palace hotel its a very good hotel in 5 star category in MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA. good service regarding reception, food, room service etc. and in around area."
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace and Towers in 2011 and was working early in the morning (3:00 am) for a meeting the next morning. I was hungry and needed a quick bite and ordered for some fries. The fries arrived within 20 minutes. 30 minutes later, I asked for the latest newspapers. The concierge came to deliver the newspaper within 10 minutes and noticing the untouched fries, asked if I would like a fresh plate. I quipped that a quick microwave reheat will do. However, 15 minutes later, I was served a freshly made serving because The Taj, doesn't serve reheated food.  That's service!"
"I stayed here about 6 months after the terrorist attacks (Trip Advisor doesn't allow back dating that far) but my business partner just returned and provided the same feedback.  This hotel has a history that is part of the British Empire.  You simple have to partake.  Great place, an icon. Part of your world-to-do-list.  The back courtyard is a place to escape the noise of Bombay.  Staff amazing.  Given the big picture and history it isn't that expensive.  Stay there at least once."
"Stayed here for 4 nights, and it was the best hotel I stayed in during my time in India. Great service, and very safe neighborhood. It is a little far from the airport, but it is very cheap to get there."
"What phenomenal value, and exquisitely presented. This redefines English high tea with unlimited Indian street food as the starter followed by Contemporary High Tea with stunning deserts all served in the splendid Seaview Terrace. Though we arrived on chance we were seated with a view of the Gate of India overlooking the ferry terminal. Having spent a fortune at the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, the previous week we were delighted that the high tea here represented excellent value and the whole experience will live with me forever. Travellers ought to be aware that pre booking is not available and in high season there may be a wait however our server was happy for us to have had the table up to 7pm though we declined. True colonial bliss!!!"
"Since we visited this hotel things are not the same anymore. Ever since we spent 4 nights here no other hotel could compete with the Taj and ""it is just not the Taj"" became a frequently used phrase on all travels after the Taj. The level of service and ownership is incredible. We felt as personal guests by all hotel staff. The architecture, the food, the flair... The professional way management and staff are dealing even with the smallest issues of their guests is exceptional! We will definately come back and can only highly recommend it!"
"Yet again I ended my trip in this wonderful hotel.  It is comforting each time you return to find the same people on the Concierge and Travel Desks.  Both desks are very efficient and I rate them highly.  I had watched Hotel India on UK television prior to returning to this hotel.  I needed a small sewing job to be carried out on a present I was taking back to England and I cannot say how grateful I am to the chap who accomplished the job so well and then brought the item up to my suite and presented his work so beautifully.  The recipient was thrilled with the work he had done, so my congratulations go to man in laundry who made the dupatta up so beautifully.  I hope very much in future the hotel will note that the rooms I enjoy in the palace section need to exude a calm"
A couple of nights of luxury were well and truly given by the staff at this hotel.   From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty and this extended throughout our stay.   We loved everything about the hotel and would definitely return if we come back to Mumbai 
"What can we say about the Taj Mahal Palace except that it was like travelling back in time. We normally stay in modern hotels, but the Taj manages to keep the old world feel & grandeur but also is bang up to date & the service, as you would expect, is impeccable. There are plenty reviews on here giving lots of details - believe all the good ones...it is truly stunning."
"We had visited Taj Mahal Palace on the occasion of me and my wifes birthday. The most amazing part is we were born on the same day. Little did we know that Taj will make it a date to remember. They were courteous, sweet and caring like it was family. We were given an upgrade to make our day even more special. Moreover, we were also given a private tour by the guest experience manager to enrich us with the character of the property. Having stayed at the best of properties, Taj is definitely a name i would never forget. Don't forget to take a dip in the moon lit pool :)"
"We have just finished off a trip around Europe with a week long stay at The Taj Mahal Palace and this was an amazing finish to a great trip. From the moment we were greeted at the airport to the moment we checked out, our stay could not have been more perfect.  The people and the service is what separates this luxury hotel apart from others. The staff go above and beyond in their service and it is the genuine, kindhearted and caring nature that they are remembered for.  We spent 6 nights here and didn't want to leave. All the facilities at the hotel are first class. In such an amazing location next to the Gateway of India, as soon as you step foot out of the hotel you are immersed in the unbelievable culture and activities of Mumbai. We cannot wait to visit again, we fell in"
"I celebrated my wife's birthday at the Taj palace and stayed for just one day  While booking they took details and reached out to me couple of days in advance for any special arrangements. Many people come and celebrate occasions here and they have  mastered the art of making their Guests feel special  Usual hotels will place a bottle of wine, cake and flower arrangements in the room.. but in addition to all this what made us feel special was the personal attention that we got. It seemed the everyone knew it was my wife's birthday and they made sure they wished her and check if everything going on fine.  There are a lot of restaurants to choose from for dinner. Most premium one is Zodiac Grill. they offered to make customized menu's with photographs and all... but it a bit"
"Everything they say about attention to detail and service is 100% true at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.  We stayed in a luxury grand city view room and it was spacious and so well appointed.  The bulters were fantastic and every member of staff was there for our every need.  YOu will not find a single scuff on a wall nor speck of dust.  The pool was lovely too and the terrace a wonderful spot for lunch.  We can highly recommend Souk on the roof of the Tower for lunch and dinner and the Masala Kraft restaurant had excellent food too.  The people of the spa looked after us exceptionally well, in fact, this was the end of a long tour through Rajasthan after which we were happily ready to go home but after a few hours here we wanted to stay longer and didn't want to come home. "
"I have stayed at this hotel multiple times and it has never failed to impress me. The location is brilliant, with the amazing sea view. The many restaurants that are present in-house serve great food but are fairly expensive.  The staff is extremely helpful and are willing to assist guests for any issues that they face. The rooms are great, and the ones in the new building have balconies too :)  Overall this is a great hotel to stay in provided one has the budget for it."
I  have travelled across the various continents but no one can match the great service standards of Taj. It's in DNA of their staff and not easy to replicate. This is one place where you would like to go back again and again and yet again.
"Just a beautiful stay at this hotel! I very strongly recommend!  Awesome rooms, big and nice swimming pool area, excellent breakfast and amazing SPA. The hotel staff is always fast and polite. Must have a dinner at the Wasabi By Morimoto restaurant! Just the high level!!!"
"The service was gracious and the room in the old palace wing of the hotel made for a perfect Diwali holiday stay.  The hotel is beautiful, old Bombay and everyone I came into contact with was affable and willing to assist. The butler service was especially helpful for any special requests.  The Starboard Bar was fantastic for drinks and light snacks highlighted by Reena and Lindsay who provided excellent entertainment singing some of today's and yesterday's favorites.  I would not hesitate to stay at this legendary hotel when in Mumbai on a future visit."
"We didn't stay here (sadly) but we did visit and have a lunch.  It is just beautiful, stunning decor, magnificently presented and kept, it's almost akin to a museum inside with exhibits in the walls (and that's just the restrooms!) The service in the restaurant was of course impeccable, full of ultra hip and professional people, as well as many rich foreigners.  The choice of coffee and tea alone was outstanding! Miss out at your peril!"
"Nothing can match the charm of Taj Mahal Palace Hotel!! I loved it! The splendid architecture seeped in history, courteous helpful staff, the warm ambience... all added up to an eventful memorable stay that's left me wanting to visit again! It's the perfect retreat tucked away in central Colaba with amazing views of the Gateway of India. The service was excellent as well...hospitality at its best!"
"Following a BBC Two program which featured this hotel we decided we would take the trip!!  We were not disappointed... from the moment we booked-in we were made to feel like Kings and Queens.   The hotel boasted First Class food in all of its restaurants which were run by professional and friendly staff. Once they had met you they remembered your names, your room number and your likes and dislikes.   The hotel is situated in its own grounds which has some stunning decor and excellent surroundings.  The swimming pool was a great place to relax - the only negative point being that during the day the roofs and walls are covered with pigeons - 1000's of them!!   The Spa and Salon offered a great range of treatments (surprisingly at great value for money) The massages rated as some"
"Taj Mahal Palace was one of our highlights during recent India visit. Great location, full of history, beautiful building, splendid interior and pool. We particularly loved the colonial feeling especially of the older part.   breakfast just extraordinary (masala dosha !!!).  A special remark for the kindness and professionalism of Azaruddin (serving at breakfast in the court area). It is very pleasant to discuss with well instructed staff. He indeed gave us lots of inside regarding Indian meals and culture."
"Firstly, the staff are excellent and friendly. The location is great and some of the decor in this hotel is really top notch. The public areas are all great. It begins to fall down at the room level, which are fairly small, dated and with only basic amenities. The mini bar selection is also poor!"
"I popped into The Sea View Bar with my friend for lunch. Its a lovely place with a wonderful colonial feeling. We were put at a table with a sea view.  From the minute we walked in until the minute we left we were treated with utter respect. If I had had the money I would have just stayed there  for the 10 days we spent in India.  The pool looked wonderful.  Obviously its not a cheap hotel. A Gin and tonic, cappuccino and two chicken sandwiches £50"
It's like going back in time to the British hey days of 1920's. An experience in quality service and wonderful surroundings. A sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The pool side environment for your family while on business could not be bettered. A true institution of indulgence and good value for money. Worth treating the family and no where close to the amazing experience.
"wish i could have stayed, but only had 12 hours in the city between flights. this is an oasis of cool welcome. walk through the door and greeted by lemongrass fragrance. asked if i could seat early as they get busy and dont take bookings. so arrived 3 for 3.30 tea. at 3.45 asked if i could order so cant accuse them of rushing! service was so friendly and helpful once i worked out the tea included the buffet AND high tea. all for c£16. got transferred to window seat when one became available. stayed 3 hours in all. amazing views of gateway to india. delicious plentiful food. this place is a must for anyone who enjoys a high tea - its a real oasis in the city's bustle. wish the pool area was open to non residents though! thank you taj - a total pleasure."
"The Taj Mahal Palace is an absolute treasure of the city and a tourist attraction of its own; its designer stores and opulent foyer are a prime location for people watching and its position opposite the Gateway is without doubt a major draw for a stop in Mumbai.  Service was uncompromising at every station, from every member without exception and certainly the hotel's finest attribute.  Breakfast was a busy, yet well executed affair with an abundance of quality options from which to choose and the pool area an oasis away from the maddening Mumbai just metres away.  My room, although plush, was not sized nor finished quite to the same level as other areas or other 5* residences I've stayed at but perfectly acceptable and with a good selection of features and complimentary items. "
"My girlfriend (now fiance :) ) and I were really looking forward to our stay at the famous Taj Mahal and we were not disappointed!   From the moment we arrived until check out, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Check in was good, and as I made a mess of our booking (I chose 1 person and not 2) this was swiftly resolved without any fuss at all.  The swimming pool is fantastic and the staff constantly topped up our cold water which is a lovely touch (The Leela Palace in Bangalore also did this, so not unique to India!).   We stayed in the Tower wing in a lovely room overlooking the Gateway to India, superb view! Our room was excellent and was brilliantly looked after by our roomkeepers. Nice touch one night when we came home to a lovely display of towels that had been arranged in a"
"A wonderful well run hotel. A bit out of the way, but an interesting location overlooking the harbor. Only four stars because the other places we stayed in India were better. limited experience in the dinning room, as we arrive late and left early. if you will be there during the day, take  room overlooking the harbor."
We went here after backpacking round india for a few weeks. we were smelly and dirty and yet we were still treated well and were welcomed.   we came here for a cup of tea and to see what it is all about and it was lovely! a real grand place to go! the staff were great and all things considered it was actually really cheap!  the options for tea and coffee were great and they were all lovely...and you get some cookies thrown in too! and if youre lucky enough you might be able to sneak away a taj palace pen! :)
"Have just left the Taj Palace Mumbai after spending 5 fantastic nights there. It was our second stay, having stayed 3 years ago and dreaming ever since of returning. Walking in the door was just like ""coming home"".  The staff would have to be the best trained in the world.   We stayed in the Palace wing (would definately request this wing when booking) and had a room on the 3rd floor, so nice and close to everything. Believe it or not Viren (Manager Experiences) remembered us from 3 years ago and immediately made us feel very special and important. Breakfasts were delightful. The staff remembered the juice we liked daily and the way we liked out omlettes cooked with bacon on the side....such a pleasure to walk into the Sea Lounge each morning for breakfast. Will we return....you"
"The place is very good. Amazing hotel. Location, location and more location. Good rooms, amazing lobby and the food is ok.  When it comes to service and going the extra mile. They know how to do that. After visiting The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, I made an unusual request. And this rare request was graciously hosted by Indrani Gupta. The executive Housekeeper. I was very surprised and very glad they  I am very grateful to them for going the extra mile and try to meet the needs of their guests. No matter that these are different. Good hospitality Good guest satisfaction Good job."
"whilst staying with my sister who lives in Thane, my mum treated us all to stay 1 night in the Taj Mahal Palace and it was just wonderful. The rooms are, like the rest of the hotel immaculate. We had a view from our room of the Gateway of India. The service staff was fantastic. no faults at all. looking forward to my next visit. Thankyou!"
"As always, this hotel never fails to impress. The suite was divinely appointed, Tiffin as room service utterly delicious and the team of employees gracious and welcoming. The transfers to the airport were timely and efficient - but that depends on the time of day and consequently traffic."
"So what's not to like about the Taj Mahal Palace in Delhi? Very little indeed: The tower rooms are small and could do with a general renovation, but they are still very good. Some complain about moldy smell in the rooms, but this is not a desert climate. The aircon in the main lobby area could be better, though. There is a smell of urine at the lobby level of the tower elevators at certain times if the day. And that is really the only issues I could identify during my five-day stay this week. The rest is praise already so abundantly well expressed by others. I will be back as soon as I can find an excuse to visit Mumbai again."
Stayed for one week in The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. We had a beautiful view of The Gateway of India and the sea beyond. The room was luxury and the service amazing. The restaurants and swimmingpool was also excellent.    We look forward to the next time we travel to Mumbai and stay at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel
"The experience I had staying in this hotel was AMAZING. I was upgraded to the heritage wing of the hotel and there is this resident's lounge which is one of it's kind. The seating arrangement is very palatial and the whole setup is very rich. To add to it, the lounge has books on the Tatas, History of Mumbai with vintage pictures. I could sit here in peace for hours.  The corridor was filled with paintings and the whole setup was very royal, made my way to the room which obviously was spacious with a view of the Arabian sea and the Gateway of India. The room was stocked with all the appropriate necessities for a business traveler.   The staff is very hospitable, I had got packed food, the service person volunteered pro-actively to heat my food and got it served to me. The"
Stayed for two days in the old wing of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. The check in was quick  and I was accompanied to the room by a guest Relations Executive. The room was spacious with excellent furnishing. I had a partial view of the Gateway of India and the sea beyond . The rooms give you a feel of luxury and charm which is missing in several 5 star hotels. The house keeping staff is efficient as I was immediately provided a ironing board when I asked for it . The bathroom is large with a tub and a separate shower area. The air conditioning was comfortable and the bed quality excellent. Breakfast is served in the Shamiana restaurant on the ground floor which is quite some distance away. I personally feel that the breakfast quality at the Taj President is better than this place
"Spotless hotel, exceptional customer service and standing out T Mistery in the bar making fabulous 1933 cocktails Lovely hotel highly recommend staff are fantastic. Views of the India gate great. Atmosphere and culture surrounding the area really interesting.  Colaba causeway an experience not to be missed."
"Requested a car to pick us up and we got a bmw 3-series new & clean. Booked a room at the tower wing, check-in at the room. Room was nice and clean, but since I was travelling with my family, we found the bathroom quite small and unimpressive. We requested an paid upgrade after viewing higher category rooms, which they obliged. The transfer was managed seamlessly. Even if the bathroom was a tad small, I got a fabulous price, so nothing really unliveable. We ate room service, tasty but limited choices and in room dining not willing to go beyond what's in the menu. The pastry's in the in room dining menu quite uninspiring. We stayed for 4 days so tried wasabi by morimoto for a meal. Food:good. Service: absolutely brilliant. The pool does not have a baby facility, considering the"
"You can go anywhere but can never stop admiring the guest relations and the service you get here. from decorating your room to putting up balloons to the cake and the flowers ,everything is more than you can ask for. the Heritage walk is awesome too. they would go beyond to make you happy. The Taj mahal mumbai is without a doubt  a peek in to our heritage and a stay at the Taj doesn't miss out upon anything at all. The cocktail hours at the lounge are a great time , the bar tender also taught me how to make my martini, it was a very special stay and a very memorable one, i always rank Taj at no 1 in terms of service. This is a Gem of a hotel :)"
"The title says it all. And make sure to book a room/suit at the old wing if your budget allows it. It's truly a palace! The service is impeccable and the room is absolutely stunning. The breakfast restaurant and the swimming pool are also the places inside the hotel that you don't want to miss.   The gate of India is right across the street. Many locals there will try to sell you tour or photo business. Just say no firmly to them and walk away immediately.   The hotel is also in the colaba neighborhood which is famous for beautiful colonial architectures. And the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (national museum), about 5-10 mins walk away, is a must see. When you are there, make sure you also see the short documentary film in its auditorium (next to the ticket"
We were a big family group traveling together and the check in process was super smooth and everything was as per our request  And beyond  I had my 2 kids with me in this trip and Taj palace have taken care of every detail and surprise my kids with 2 games and soft toys in their room !  Food in in room dinning is very good  As well as in the Indian Cusine Resturant  As for breakfast I think it can be more improved and add more international items Overall stay was excellent
"We were on a family holiday and choose this property for the location and the history. Sea facing rooms are with an excellent view of the Gate way of India and the sea. The Staff are excellent. Mr. Virren, Manager have checked us in efficiently with Welcome drink and garlanding. The ambience and the service of the staff at hotel was very good. The swimming Pool is heat controlled, less chlorine and the kids througly enjoyed it.  Do not miss the heritage tour given my Mr. Viren,@1700 hrs. Good history lesson on Taj Mahal Palace."
"What can you say? It is first class deluxe, impressive history, great location, opulent and excellent staff and service. It is an experience in itself over and above any holiday or visit to India. Definitely a tourist attraction. Just one little quibble, more of an observation. It would have to be the only hotel in this class, (or 4 star for that matter), that doesn't have complimentary fruit/chocolate in the rooms. Otherwise the best."
"We spent four nights with kids 10 and 12 at The Palace and enjoyed the location, the history and the sheer range of offerings at the hotel.  We loved meals at both The Golden Dragon and the Sea Lounge.  The service poolside was brilliant and the surroundings are incomparable.  Drawback for us was the tired condition of the room.  We stayed in adjoining rooms in the Tower.  One of the rooms with two person capacity had a full bed instead of a queen.  The bathrooms were well appointed but small.  The carpeting deserved replacement and the scent of mildew/humidity hung around (it is Mumbai after all...).  Every person with whom we interacted was of the highest professional standard and was helpful and friendly.  We would probably do it again but ask to stay in the main building-"
"After arriving in Mumbai from a visit to Dubai in the early evening and having to contend with the traffic in this city of over 22 million people, you arrive at this hotel and are immediately exposed to the security measures all hotels in India have put in place.   This hotel has two buildings, one is the Palace which is 100 years old and then there is the tower. For a wonderful experience you need to stay in the Palace. The rooms are very nice, the staff extremely friendly and the service impecable. I can honestly say that Indian hotel staff members are some of the best trained employees in the world.  The staff members in the breakfast room have been there for a very long time and they know how to take care of the guests."
"The whole staff is accommodating, sweet and always smiling. The hotel is beautiful and the sunrise on the gateway of India is priceless. The only minus is that the rooms and the hallways in the tower are outdated, but I generally don't spend much time in the room anyways. I highly recommend this hotel if you will stay in Mumbai.   I also recommend the Japanese restaurant in the hotel. The service and the staff are equally nice and their fish is as fresh as they come."
"The best part of the Taj Palace hotel is their staff. From the reception to the housekeeping to the restaurants, each and every team member at this property tries their absolute best to make the guests comfortable. We stayed at this property for 9 days during July when we were traveling from the US to India. We loved each day spent at this place and would surely recommend it. We celebrated both our kids birthdays here and the housekeeping staff we were sweet in arranging surprises for the kids in their room.the restaurant staff was also very nice and made us feel very special.great place to stay!"
"There are some hotels that should be on your bucket list and this is one of them! Dare to pay the extra to stay in a palace club room with access to the palace room. If nothing else the architecture and artwork will thrill you. The Sea Lounge is such a delight, while a tad busy at breakfast, lunch and high tea are a delight. Lazy by the pool for the afternoon with a good book and drift off, away from the hustle and bustle of the streets below. A G&T in the outdoor bar before dinner in anyone of the Taj's superb restaurants. So goo I've put it back on my bucket list as there's so much more to discover."
"Great views of the Gateway, fantastic food and the highlight for me was the photo of John & Yoko signed from there stay in 1970 . Service was outstanding and great place for a rest for the craziness of this city. If you can afford a night here I recommend it highly  "
The hotel is beautiful and the service is outstanding. This is a wonderful way to ease into Mumbai (Bombay) and India.  The pluses:  - Beautiful hotel - Great views if you are on the Gateway side - very good spa - Fantastic pool; very deep and wonderful to swim in  - Service like you probably have never experienced  The opportunities for improvement
"This is the original Taj, I stayed in the palace side, and glad that I did.  Very well appointed, and gives you a sense of what it was like in the 1920s.  I was here in the monsoon season.  My first room was a little musty because it had just rained for three days continuously.  When I told the staff, they immediately gave me a better room.  This is all understandable because it is a very old hotel in Monsoon Country.  I saw the other reviews on this, and I think the hotel does the best they can, having to maintain a 100 year hotel in a country that gets months of rain.  They are constantly trying to keep the rain out, and then drying out after the rains stop, I think the hotel does an excellent job taking care of this problem.  The area is nice, and very crowded.  You can see"
The staff out there are friendly and they made our stay very comfortable.The rooms and restaurants are top notch.Heads of to their chefs for their presentation of their delicious food items.But there is no wi-fi without paying extra.Overall we love the stay.Thank you
"A night at the Taj Mahal Palace heritage hotel, is more like a themed experience than just a night's nice accommodation.  From the hope of a possible upgrade, to the showmanship of Viren, on the heritage tour of the hotel's history, to just enjoying the ambiance of  a hotel with such an iconic place in Mumbai's identity, it's all great fun.  Also, the longer spent there, the more you find a genuine commitment to the personal needs of guests, which is truly lovely.   The downsides are the significant cost and also a reluctance to leave the hotel and miss out on all the good things. A stay at this hotel deserves your full attention, so best timed after major sightseeing.  Rooms start at about $AUS 254 (Sat/Sun) for a city view in the newer Tower Wing.  While this might miss out on"
"the best five star hotel right opposite the sea and the gate way of india ,Taj mahal HOTEL IS ONE OF THE BEST HOTEL IN INDIA , very courteous people , great hospitality , great food , great ambience , you can have whatever food you want to eat ,  let it be  anywhere from india or around the world   , they will serve it to you ,indian , continental , chinese , thai , lebonese , italian  there is a very nice restaurant in taj    named tanjore  here the food is really yummy the authentic south flavour, tanjore is a place ,city in south"
"As a weekend break from daily routine, my husband & I love to get pampered by the Taj Mahal Palace which is only a short distance from home.    This time to my recent visit I was highly disappointed with the hotel management & staff at the reception.  As we always stay at the heritage wing of the hotel, the atmosphere of the full heritage reception was once upon a time was very royal & felt special.  This time it was totally the opposite, it felt I was entering Colaba Market & awaiting to get settled into my room.  During the month of August, the hotel was full of Arabs who were staying at the heritage wing.  Whilst I was waiting for my turn at the reception, the reception was giving upfront discounted rates off close to INR 10K per room per night to these foreigners.  Who in"
"Can't fault this place, if your looking for a bit (lot) of luxury in your life..... then you need to stay here! We decided on here because of where it was & it was extremely gay friendly even though I had heard otherwise beforehand! Our room overlooked the harbour & Gateway to India, so worth it! I would recommend a stay here at least once in your life, you won't regret it!"
"Do buy/google the BBC2 series of 'Hotel India' which is about this hotel. It is inexplicable: how do explain bliss? I was just reading recent trip advisor reviews of this hotel and generally, everyone loves it but there is one issue which 'management' need to address urgently: the not free internet. Please dont reply saying 'we working on it, it's been outsourched, etc'. heard that line at least a year ago! hey man, i was at a basic parisian two star hotel recently and internet was free.   but i don't go to india to do my emails, so i forgive that one but it's a significant downer. the only reason i mentioned this as my review would have been too gushing...you have not lived unless you have been to 'hotel india'!!!"
"I stayed here on the night of my marriage for 2 days.Its a beautiful hotel with so many things to talk about. Trip Advisor would run into pages if i write about every single detail. I am true fan of Taj Hotels in India. The food, staff, the architecture, the artifacts, the hospitality, the overall experience itself is so authentic and memorable. You will always have something to take back from here. The eye to details is amazing and I will truly appreciate the leadership team of the hotel for holding it.  Every single employee there takes their job with so much of pride and  go all out to ensure that you have a comfortable stay. I am glad I stayed here and look forward to coming back soon! Kudos to the team!"
"This hotel lives up to its reputation. Stunning environment, great service, fine dining & superior in every way. We were made to feel like VIPs from the minute we walked in. Thank you Taj for a great stay. "
Was here a long time ago with my parents. I don't think it has changed much though and it is truly a magnificent experience to have stayed here. Gateway to India is outside and there you can get a boat to Elephanta Island. It beautiful with carved out sculptures of the Hindu gods in cave. The hotel serves excellent food and the rooms are very nicely decorated.
"Staying at the Taj Mahal Palace had always been a dream of mine. Being a great admirer of Jamsetji Tata and having read all I could about the history of the hotel, our choice was easy when we found ourselves in Mumbai. Jamsetji Tata went through enormous pains to build the hotel and he built it sparing no expense or luxury. The Taj was a labour of love.   Having spent two nights there, our stay was nothing short of pleasant. We encountered many staff members who were extremely hospitable. Mr. Mistry at Wasabi, Mr. Bhushan at the Sea Lounge, Mr. Moshin and Mr. Sunil by the pool and Ms. Ayesna (sp?) at the reception were very gracious and welcoming.   There are a few reasons why I gave it a 4 star and I hope the hotel takes it as constructive criticism and not judgement on the"
"Stayed recently as part of a business trip with Taj Hotels - met some of the 'stars' of the BBC show!  The setting really is iconic - view from room across the Gateway and Bay of Bombay is amazing. Lovely to see the city come to life at night walking down the sea front. The hotel was really welcoming, the garden / pool area a little haven of tranquillity in a crazy city! Interesting history and comfortable room."
"I have had the pleasure of travelling around India for almost 3 weeks, as a mining engineer I tend to spend time in remote areas without electricity, water and basic amenities. My employer booked me a room at the Taj Mahal Palace and I can honestly say, after travelling the world for 6 months this is by far my best experience. From the pick-up at the airport to the absolutely exemplary service I have experienced, which at some stages has left me dumbfounded. As a foreigner who travels the world on a weekly basis this hotel is the best I've seen in 4 years, exemplary service, friendly, intelligible staff and management who will bend over backward to make your stay that much more enjoyable. 110% satisfaction and I still have a spa trip and restaurant booking to enjoy. Thank you"
"I had the fortune to stay here on a business trip for a few days and it makes no apologies for addressing the luxury end of market, but if  you can afford it you will not be disappointed with the outstanding courteous service at every level and an attentive eye to detail across all departments to customers needs. There is just a sense of history in such an Iconic Mumbai landmark which is rooted to the location along side the Gateway to India, and the imprint or atmosphere of famous people past from Statesmen to pop stars to simply the ""who's who"" of the day who stayed here over the past 100 years."
"This is one of the best hotels in the Southern peninsula of Mumbai. It is landmark heritage building that has been nicely preserved and protected and matches perfectly with the nearby Gateway of India. All the high and mighty have visited and slept in this hotel, so it's full of history and definitely has seen glorious and not so glorious days as well.  If you want to lavish in a modern five star room then ask for one in the tower, but if you want to step back in time and make contact with the real flavor of India then ask for a room in the old wing. Maybe you will say that the rooms in the old wing are pricey and they are not close to a five star rating, because the furniture is not so modern, but they come with a sea view and with a history, so if you can live up with only"
"Mumbai in July is hot, like an oven, and sometimes very wet, like a bath.  So it is good to have a cool, reasonably comfortable hotel like the Taj.  But, the inside of the Taj, with the endless staircases and galleries, does look like a prison.   The Taj is not a particularly beautiful hotel.   The old part looks like a large carpet mill and the new part looks like a car park.   Mumbai's Falkland Road is more colourful, although it also makes me think of prisons.  The suites at the Taj are OK, if you are as rich as Bill Clinton.  But some of the ordinary rooms are very ordinary.  Food and service vary in quality.  In the hotel lobby there is a small memorial to the 31 people killed in the hotel in 2008.  It is not always easy to get a hotel room in Mumbai, or so they tell you at"
It's just top notch. Enjoyed the Sunday brunch.  It's just brilliant. So tasty and a very grand spread.  Such a nice gesture and hospitality.   I would definitely visit the place again and if your ever in Bombay it's a must visit.  
"On my recent visit to Mumbai I booked 4 nights at the Taj Mahal Resort.  I was given a Palace wing room overlooking the swimming pool.  The hotel was beautiful with a spectacular inner atrium.  The whole hotel is very colonial in style.  There is a pool that was hardly busy located in the private gardens within the hotel that is for guests only.  Front desk service - impeccable. Room attendant - couldn't ask for better.  Everything is just done to your satisfaction without a lot of fuss.  The place reminds me of grand hotels like the Penninsula in HK, the Raffles in Singapore and te Waldorf in NYC."
"We made a booking at the Taj Mahal in Mumbai. We wanted to enjoy in the beautiful heritage part of the hotel, bu were booked instead in the extended part of the hotel, which was very disappointing. Anyhow, the rooms were like any Taj gateway hotels...but were charged a bomb, probably due to its location. We had the view of the sea and the gateway of India. The view was amazing. Food is par excellence as usual in the Taj. Service is impeccable. There are lots of nice restaurants near the Taj as well. Leopold is just walking distance."
We went to the Sea View Lounge for afternoon tea and sandwiches during our visit to Mumbai and this hotel is absolutely amazing! We sat beside the window and we could see the gateway of India.The hotel is very clean and beautiful and I would most definitely recommend a visit to this hotel.
"The Taj palace is not only a hotel, it is an icon in its own right. If you are in Mumbai, you are bound to see it as soon as you travel to Gateway of India.  The contrast that the hotel provides, i.e. the best of the street options on the outside, where if you were to walk you can easily venture into Mumbai's busy markets, and very calm and elegant on the inside.  The hotel is very well furnished and as soon as you step in you get the feeling of having stepped into the lap of luxury.  The food like all Taj properties is nice."
"My absolutely favorite hotel in Bombay. Even staying for one night only is totally worth it. Especially in the old wing. The Jiva Spa is fabulous, the staff always helpful and discrete, breakfast buffet is amazing and the whole Ambiente makes you feel very special. Love it."
"I stayed here for four nights recently and can't begin to tell you how great of an experience it was. Overall I'm sure TMP has great service, but I was upgraded to an executive suite, which was absolutely amazing. The room itself was very stately, and came along with a 24.7 butler! What sets TMP apart from other hotels is its ability to be proactive in identifying the needs of its guests and the ""little things."" They did small things that added so much to my stay: randomly set up a foot bath, left a eye glass cloth next to my sunglasses on the desk, gave me a gift of bangles during an Indian festival. In addition, the breakfast buffet (which was included in my package) was delicious. The hotel restaurants are very good, but pricey. You can find food outside the hotel that is a"
"I was there on business and was upgraded on arrival to one of the palace rooms.  Superb: huge bed, glorious bathroom, and views out over the Gate of India across the sea.  Breakfast was good, but as others have said, it's the attention to superb service here which gives it it's edge. Faultless.  "
"I have been tens of time at the Taj Mahal Palace. It is my favorite hotel in Mumbai. Thecombination of the common areas and the terrace and swimming pool make it good for all activities. The proximity of the Gate of India plunges the visitor in the Mumbai crowd while keeping the hotel as an oasis. Beautifully refurbished since the terrible attack it had to ensure, the TAJ Mahal kept its soul and wonderful Indian atmosphere. The restaurants are superb and most of them are gastronomic. It desperately needs state-of-the art phone systems and WiFi connections."
"Even though this is a large hotel the level of attention and service is second to none. Particularly impressed by the staff who had the remarkable ability to anticipate our every need. Our Butler, hearing that we were leaving for Jaipur with 10 minutes to spare sped away and printed off suggestions of places for us to do and see without being asked. Highly recommended if you want somewhere special and I understand why this is the Jewel in the Tata crown."
"Real 5 Star. Loved it. Makes Mumbai a wonderful place to travel. So much surrounds the hotel, but it has exceptional service and a awesome pool. I would return in a heartbeat. From entering to check out it was a pleasure"
"PROS: - the service is like no other, every staff is amazingly attentive! I feel that 70% of what you pay is for the service.  - fantastic restaurants (but expect standard 5-star prices!), the food was always delicious. - great breakfast buffet. Fresh dosas and lovely authentic chutneys to accompany and great quality western food (I was very impressed with the patisserie selection and quantity)  - hotel itself is quite beautiful (lovely architecture, scenic places to sit down and enjoy the atmosphere)  - easy check-in process and easy check out - nice location in Colaba, very safe.  - hotel offered a late checkout for a small cost  - good sized room, good sized bathroom,  - very good selection of tv stations (great spread of English + Hindi )  - wifi (additional cost) speed is"
My fiancé and I had finished our 3 month trip across India and decided to finish in style with a meal at the Taj Palace.  We had a few drinks in the bar and asked if it was possible to book a table in the Souk restaurant later that evening.  The gentleman we spoke to said it was possible but we should go immediately because they were vey busy that evening.    We headed to the restaurant as advised and it was completely empty.  We were shown to our table by a very friendly lady who worked at the front of house.  There were waiters rushing around setting the things up and 5 minutes later no one had given us a menu or asked if we wanted a drink.  I called someone over and requested a menu and we were once again left waiting for over 5 minutes.  Sensing our frustration the lady at
"I have been in and out of the Taj  ocasionally several times in he 1960's and 70's not as a resident but in their restaurents  and visiting with  business colleagues from US/UK. My last visit was a lunch in March 2014. The place and its staff literally ooze in their readiness to serve every person that enters this Taj Mahal. The layout of the dining rooms ix excellent and feels almost like your dining room.   Selection of foods is as a great as it's preparation. It would be difficult to fault it, even if I was in a bad mood and losing a contract in business.  Thank you one and all"
"Very hard to beat this hotel for class, history and customer service.  Treated like royality from the minute you walk through the door. Made to feel like a maharaja.   We were lucky to have been given a room overlooking the Gateway of India. The food was amazing and the staff well trained. Boutiques were amazing too. "
"While I've traveled a good amount throughout my life, this was my first time going to India. My wife and I had no idea what to expect upon arrival and only hoped that we'd at least be staying at places that lived up to our previous experiences with western establishments. We GREATLY underestimated the level of hospitality provided by five start facilities in India. This hotel didn't just live up to my expectations, it absolutely blew them away. From the moment we arrived the staff was incredibly helpful. The reception staff checked us in and took us directly to our room, even despite our 2AM arrival from overseas. Glen, the concierge member who had reached out prior to our arrival to help us with both booking tours for our time and even arranged SIM cards for our cell phones"
We just went for a coffee.  Knowbody seemed to notice we had entered the hotel. I asked at reception were to get a coffee. The person pointed with a pen to the coffee shop without even looking up. The whole place had an odd smell of urine. There was only two othet people in the coffee shop who also looked none plussed with the naff atmosphere.  There are many other 5 star hotel's in Mumbai. Im not sorry we did not stay there.
"Read all the reviews and thought we must stay here for our 25th anniversary.    This is by far one of the best hotels I've ever stayed. The moment you walk through the doors, they make you feel very welcome and special   The staff are very well trained, very polite and always willing to help you with whatever you ask of them.   We were upgraded to a Deluxe room when they found out it was our 25th anniversary, without us knowing.   The location is absolutely spot-on for whatever you want to do in Mumbai.   I will come back time and time again.  "
"We were celebrating my wife’s 40th b’day and stayed at the Taj for a night to bring in the occasion. This was a surprise treat for her and based on my prior experiences with Taj hotels, I knew that they would make our celebrations special and Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai lived up to every last bit of my expectation and surpassed it by a mile.  I am a gold TIC, epicure plus member and made a booking about 3 months in advance with a voucher that I had. Within a couple of days of making the booking, I got a small questionnaire seeking my preferences. The last question asked was if I was celebrating any occasion and could they make any special arrangements. I replied saying that we were celebrating my wife’s 40th b’day and I would get in touch with them closer to the day.  I was"
I stayed last week with my husband who was in Mumbai on a business trip. It rained a lot so I ended up spending a lot of time in the hotel. The room in the Palace Wing was well appointed with a large bathroom. They upgraded us to a sea view room so we had a nice view of the water and Gateway of India. Breakfast in the sea view lounge was good. The service is excellent but the spread was okay. Enjoyed the swimming pool and pool side area. Had it pretty much to ourselves because of the rain. The staff all around were very helpful and eager to please. Location is excellent. Close to a number of nice restaurants and shops.  Throughly enjoyed my stay here and will be back on my next trip to Bombay.
"Undoubtedly, there are two kinds of people in the world - those who have stayed in the taj palace and those who haven't. The moment you enter the hotel, you start counting yourself among the royalty. The hospitality and the perfectly trained staff showing it are unbeatable. The reception is huge with a magnificent lobby. Everything has grandiose attached to it. The ambience is magnificent"
"Very comfortable hotel, very good staff, awesome breakfast, wonderful rooms, very good swimming pool. very good location, recommended for business or family trip, if need to go back to India definitely will choose this hotel again."
"Again, being reminded to the days that I was not active on Tripadvisor, I watched a program on the BBC about this Hotel. It shows a hotel that is just perfect, in every way and detail, with a very committed staff that will take care of your every need. So in 99% of the case I guess it is the perfect hotel, Sadly me and my family were part of the not so well treated 1%.  At first we were impressed by the way we were picked up at the Airport, coming from the Taj Exotica in Goa that highly recommended the Taj Mahal Palace. 2 large cars that swiftly took us to the hotel. Men in beautiful suits guided us to the reception and took care of our luggage. but then it started. Something I was not expecting at all in a class hotel like this. The staff asked for tips.  At the Taj in Goa, no"
"I traveled to India with my husband on business, he worked, I played.  During this particular visit we stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace.  While my husband worked, I explored the surrounding area.  I walked across the street and wandered around the Gateway to India.  Lots of beggars and tourists but still an amazing experience.  I then ventured off to the shopping areas near the hotel and just wandered aimlessly - not a lot of ""real"" shopping but lots of touristy stuff.  I ended up back at the hotel and decided to take advantage of all it had to offer.  I went to the pool and layed out.  They can serve you drinks but not food by the pool so once I had enough sun I dined at the restaurant right near the pool. It was all actually very nice.  My husband and I then attended a business"
"This is a superb hotel, especially if you stay in the Club rooms in the Heritage wing. They know how to take care of you  - with warm, hospitality and efficiency. Breakfast - and the High Tea at the Sea lounge are amazing. Be sure to enjoy the Club lounge with tea/coffee all day long, cocktails in the evening and Cognac and chocolate tasting in the evening. Wonderful views from the windows, a pillow menu so you get that just-right feel, and a really good sized room. A butler to take care of you, personally, whats more one who demands that you ask more of him. A bubble bath drawn for you, a crisp crease in your trousers, or a toothbrush because you forgot yours at home. Comfortable beds - some sounds from the street if your rooms face the sea, but nothing could keep us awake"
"Beautiful buildings ...old and new, excellent service, secured like a fortress, since it was terrorist bombed) Fantastic view of The Royal Gate. Fantastic shops in the building ,the massage in the Spa just heavenly."
I recently stayed at the Taj on business. The service was absolutely amazing and the hotel was beautiful and in a great location.   I had a massage in the Spa and I could not fault it.  The only slightly negative comments I would make is that the rooms in the Tower wing could do with bathroom upgrades and the hotel could provide free wifi for its guests.
"Undoubtedly, there are two kinds of people in the world - those who have stayed in the taj palace and those who haven't. The moment you enter the hotel, you start counting yourself among the royalty. The hospitality and the perfectly trained staff showing it are unbeatable. The reception is huge with a magnificent lobby. Everything has grandiose attached to it. The ambience is magnificent. The mixture of the gothic, the Corinthian, the German , Belgian and the Persian and Mughal architecture is the envy of the hotels all across the world. The rooms are well designed. The bath tubs are huge. The restaurants are excellent. It has splendid paintings displayed all over . Do not miss the complimentary guided tour of the hotel which begins at 5 pm.  Remember - if you have booked taj"
"This is an iconic hotel. All  (most) the celebrities, kings and presidents have stayed here. The location is fantastic, right by the Gateway to India, buy the sea. The area is nice with many shops, restaurants, cafes etc. The restaurants in the hotel are expensive (we only tried the indian onw). The pool and fitness centre are great. Rooms are quiet, wonderful beds, bathrooms etc. Stay here some nights if you can afford just to be able to feel history and enjoy the luxury. The building itself is beatiful with a lot of marble and the central tower and staircase, the portals, the paintings, and the different lounges."
"Well what can I say, this is very special, very romantic and outstanding customer service, from the moment you arrive, you feel very welcome, the rooms are to die for, the food is very good. Make sure you take the time to eat on the 27th floor for that very special occasion."
"This hotel is a must.  You feel like you've stepped back in time when staying in the old wing.  The service is excellent, rooms spotless, decor beautiful,  A tour of the old wing is given every afternoon by a very engaging young man who knows his history.   Definitely  a must. We had an excellent  view of the Gateway to India from our room.  The hotel is centrally located - within walking distance to some good shopping.  The pianist in the foyer provides a pleasant and relaxing welcoming and whilst waiting for pick ups."
This place never let's me down.  Had a massage at the viva on the property well worth it. The service is fantastic and will keep coming back. Left a jumper behind they are sending it on. Very happy overall
I don’t think that I should give any Review to Taj Mahal Hotel (Mumbai) as No doubt this is Best Historical Property with all Modern & Comfort Amenities in Indian Hotel Industry. I am just writing this to change mind of some of our Friends who are unhappy with unpleasant behavior of Staff. I had stay for 02 Nights in Taj on 29th Aug’14 to Celebrate my Birthday. Upon Check-In I  was quite confused that how they will treat me a Normal Indian Guest after reviewing the Views of Some Guest about their Services to Indian Clients. But I will say Everything was Simply Excellent & Great according to the name of Palace in Every Manner
"We stayed here in August 2014 for one night as a short weekend trip to Mumbai.   We were arriving in Mumbai by train from Pune and had arranged a pick-up by the hotel. The driver was waiting on the train platform for us and swiftly took us to the car, where there was water and a refreshing towel available. Driver was very professional and gave us the timings to the hotel etc.   Check-in at the hotel was seamless. We were picked up from the car and taken directly to our room where check-in was completed at the room itself. We had booked a seaview room in the Tower part of the hotel, which is less expensive, and the view did not disappoint. We had a small balcony (not really usable but good for the view) overlooking the Gateway to India, which was lovely in the evening when it is"
There is no hotel chain in the world which pampers n gives amazing services to its guests as Taj group does.  We stayed for one night at Taj Mahal place in old wing We were given sea view room and were welcomed with traditional Tilak garlands and welcome drink Soon we started on heritage tour which lasted for around 45 mins and enlightened us on rich heritage and history of hotel Staying in taj is a wonderful experience because the staff are so warm and well trained that u really feel special and welcomed Rooms are good complete with modern amenities and we really enjoyed gateway of india view Would definately visit again in future.
Stayed one night on business hotel staff really attentive and helpful.  Room was spotless and perfectly laid out. Don't miss out of the view from the restaurant on the 18th floor at night and the foods good.
"We stayed at the old and iconic wing of the hotel and we were quite impressed by the ambience, the refined decor and the spacious rooms. A must - great location as well. Customer service also up to the standards"
"The staff are perfectly professional and helpful. they cant do enough. The rooms are updated, marble, seamless glass, balconies, and great views. The hotel great rooms are majestic. The value is very good. I originally booked us in a good boutique hotel near by but couldn't get the train tickets so changed to the Taj and let the travel desk get the train tickets."
"We started in the Tower wing and due to some problem with other bookings managed to get moved to the Palace Wing. Wow. Fantastic. Beautiful old style butler service in one of the nicest room I've ever stayed in (and that includes Bellagio, Las Vegas). Looking over the Arabian Sea and the Gateway to India. What an experience. This is one place we will remember for a very long time"
"Truly amazing and beautiful place to stay.  Steeped in history, gloriously well-kept with impeccable service.  We were upgraded to a Palace room and it was incredibly luxurious.  We ate in several of the numerous restaurants and the food was delicious in all of them.  The pool was immaculate.  There is nothing to fault this hotel - a lush oasis to return to after a hectic day in Mumbai."
"This is a fantastic hotel and genuinely lives up to the sterling reputation that it was worked hard to achieve. My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The pools, grounds and gardens are beautiful, and the location of this trademark Indian institution left nothing to be desired. Its location on Apollo Bunder is fantastic, and is in close proximity to many important Bombay sites. Rooms are sumptuous, well furnished, clean and everything conceivable is adequate or excellent in quality. The view from its rooms are also great. Whilst this is a great hotel to stay at, it is in fact reasonably priced and definitely recommended for both special occasions and business travellers. The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel deserves its sterling reputation!"
"I love this hotel, so relaxing. The foods great, the pool area is beautiful and the staff are lovely and generous. We stayed here in March and I can't wait to go again next year. I think it may be my favourite hotel in the world!"
"Listed in 1000 Place to See Before You Die, it does live up to its reputation.  There are two spaces: the original and a tower next door, all connected from a magnificent central lobby.  Either is a good choice.  The tower has the advantage of height which allows many rooms to view the sea and port. Our room had a screen across the patio which formed an early 20th century visage to the Gate and beyond. We did not use the restaurants, but stayed with room service, which was fine.  The hotel has a tour which was enjoyable.  Strolls around the neighborhood may be disappointing as Mumbai is extremely crowded at most hours. The security is very pronounced; checkpoints and metal detectors are at the entrance and taxis are inspected.  It may be slow to get to the hotel from the airport"
"It is an impressive building with history too.  But there is a smell in the hotel, the layout requires you for long walks, the breakfast was average, internet is charged separately.  The service is okay but not great, what you would expect from a restaurant at that level.  We ate once in the hotel and we were almost the only ones. This also should have given us an indication what to expect. The food was okay, the wine served way to warm.  The price / quality ratio is not great."
This is a good central KL hotel. The club lounge is wonderful and it does work despite some overcrowding.   Rooms are very comfortable indeed. Worth a visit. I'd suggest getting Taj membership to ensure your treated like a VIP.
"We stayed at the taj mahal palace and were 100% overwhelmed by the entire experience.  The welcome, the décor, the bouquets of flowers in every corner of the hotel, the unique and interesting tour of the hotel was just the beginning.  We spent our entire 2 day stay smiling.  It was the small details that made the difference for us such as the turning down service which was outstanding and how literally every colleague would greet you.  We ate in the Chinese restaurant and had a fantastic waiter who recommended some outstanding dishes for us (shredded lamb and chicken/seafood crispy noodles)  We stayed in the palace wing and was able to have free access to the tea room which was so lovely.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough, we travelled a lot around india and it was our"
"Staying in this hotel was a very different experience. Don't opt this this hotel entirely for luxuury. I had a room in the palace wing of the hotel. It was pretty nice, but not the best room I had in India,by a long shot! I also felt the AC was not too good in the corridors, as it used to get a bit hot there. The service too was very good, but not impeccable! It's not bad, but if just luxury is your foremost priority you have better options.  Stay in this hotel for the history!! The palace section really takes you back to a different time. There is a rustic charm all around you. I've stayed in lot of good heritage hotels in India, but this is competely different. This hotel has modern history and not some stories of kings! A very new experience.   They have a history tour around"
"Don't miss this, if you travel to mumbai. This is by far one of the top hotels of india. There are 2 wings, old palace and the new wing. Palace side is where I will recommend you to stay. Taj always makes you feel like home. This is part of the chain of hotels run by india's most trusted groups : the Tata group ( around 150 billion $ group)  This is a royal experience.  "
"We stayed here on our last night in India and only wish we stayed longer!This hotel is amazing, great location, great choice for breakfast and staff are so helpful. They made us feel so welcome and despite the large numbers who stay here. when we checked in we were made feel like the only guests which you don't often get in larger hotels!They also allowed us a late checkout which was great! The pool area is lovely it gets the sun all day but there is also plenty of shade if that's what you need. We will be back for longer on our next trip!"
"Got a chance to visit the Taj Mahal Palace. We went for a coffee at Shamiana Resturant. The service, quality was as what you expect.  The hotel looks marvelous from outside and from inside too..... We also saw the Memorial Stone ( A tribute )which is laid inside the Hotel for the individuals who died in 26/11 incident. I would just say ""May there soul rest in peace "".   Overall the hotels facilities are good"
"Its not everyday that you get a chance to spend a day at THE TAJ! Its the King among all hotels in Mumbai (due to its sheer location and brand name). The very name Taj Mahal spells grandiosity, magnificence and beauty and the hotel falls nothing short of it. The place has an old world charm with its magnificent domes and the design of its interiors.  It has a superb pool with a couple of attendants always at your service. The Shamiana where the complimentary breakfast is provided is just a class apart. World class cuisine (they have a selection of Continental, Indian, Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian food) and exemplary service at the Shamiana. You always have a couple of attendants at your call. The Cystal ball room where we had the presentation has an old world charm."
We stayed in the original palace part of the hotel---not the tower. The whole experience was exceptional. Our beautiful room overlooked the Gateway to India monument and the water. We took the courtesy hotel tour at 5pm and recommend it highly to hear all the history and to see much of what this hotel has to offer. Afternoon tea in the tea-room and a special cocktail created in the Waterfront Bar in 1933 are a must. We dined in the Masala Kraft and enjoyed it very much. Lunch in the Colonnade near the pool was delicious as well. Every single member of staff we encountered extended a warm greeting to us. We will definitely return to this beautiful establishment.
"this was the most wonderful hotel stay in our life- we had a mixture of tradition, heritage and history all around us in this monumental hotel. we were ushered an and pampered in this monument of luxury and had an unprecedented and finest experience ever."
"The Taj is where me and my partner have always celebrated landmarks in our lives. Either Golden Dragon, Masala Kraft, Souk, Sea Lounge or Zodiac grill is where we usually go. We chose to spend a night here once and what a memorable experience it was!   We did the the Taj Hotel tour which is at 5pm everyday and i recommend everyone to go for it. Lovely anecdotes about the hotel were told and various artifacts were explained..  Pros -Hospitality: One cannot beat the hospitality at the Taj, everyone is made to feel important and esteemed. If they realized that they've managed to upset you, they'll go all out to correct it and make sure a smile is put on to your face! Their older staff is just delightful and pleasing. -Food: Take time out to enjoy all their eateries all are"
"Stay at Taj will remain as one of the most unforgettable stay. Lovely location, ambience, awesome food and service. The breakfast spread is one of the best I have ever had in India or abroad. Would love to go again."
"One of my most favourite hotel. I loved everything these was to love about the hotel, the room was clean and very cozy, the service was way beyond my expectation and the food to die for. The location is excellent.  I stayed in August 2012 for my 30th birthday, I was working in India alone and decided to allow me a weekend of luxury. The hotel is welcoming and like I have said before the service was beyond my expecations. It was personal and made you feel right at home. Being one of the first (one before) from my country to visit the hotel they printed out the my national newspapers to read. Really amazing, it is not just a hotel stay it is an experience!"
"Stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace, Colaba, Mumbai on 1st Aug. We had a top floor room facing the Gateway of India & it was an amazing site. There was nothing fancy about the room, but had an old/royal charm to it. The balcony facing the sea was def a plus point. The service was top notch, we asked for linen sheets at 2am in the night & the call was answered & delivered in 5 mins.  The food quality was really good. The breakfast area ambience besides the swimming pool was too good & the offerings of western & Indian cuisine was elaborate. I will def say that the staff was the real highlight, everybody was courteous & helpful. As expected it was a SUPER experience.. :)"
"We stayed there after the terrorists attack and maybe a year after it reopened. The rooms are large and nicely decorated. The service is as always, at its best when it comes to Taj Heritage hotels accross the country. We had a buttler asking us on the way out of our room what were our plans for the day. When we got back, we had on our bed a list of addresses and tips about the city related to our plans !!! To me the best service ever."
The Taj Mahal is by far the very BEST hotel I have ever had the honor and priviledge to experience. Everybody and everything is exquisite. This hotel is a piece of paradise which will make your trip (business or leisure) unforgettable. Namaste ! I will NEVER forget you !
"Right from entering to the main lobby to getting a bon voyage from the staff. This hotel lives upto the Taj standards Other hotel should send there staff here to make them understand what guest service means! The food was delicious, the satff ws attentive and caring , the rooms gives u a sense of royalty What else u want ! I am sure they have lotta things in store. Will keep visiting! "
The entrance is hidden with gates and security as you enter. Security is very high on the agenda here which is good. Beautiful Lobby as we enter. At reception we we're check in smoothly even though it was very busy. Given a lovely jasmine garland and taken to our room with complimentary drink. We had been upgrade  to the the heritage wing which was a nice surprise. The view was not good as it was a corner room. The room was large with high ceilings and luxury bed and separate bathroom with all the amenities. The stair case is amazing. The palace has very old English colonial feel and look to it around the heritage wing especially around the pool. The pool is lovely with a great service but having lunch can prove very expensive. Breakfast at the sea lounge has beautiful views of
The rooms were consumed and very old with very bad smell and worse view.. it smells like urine.. back in my county such a hotel will Not even take 2 stars only... we spook to the manager about the smell who only sent a cleaner to clean the room and put a device that did nothing actually ..  that 3 days was horable that no one cloud sleep and we all ran to our agency to rescadule our flight back to my country... they were not cooperative with us as they didn't even offer us to change the room moreover we ask them to change the room but all what we get was a machine that did nothing.. i will never get back to taj and i don't recommend that hotel to any one who expect a 5 stars hotel 
"I go quarterly to Mumbai for business and it is never complete without a stay at the Taj Mahal Palace. Impeccable service, incredible food and beautiful grounds. The pool, spa and club bar were outstanding. I always look forward to my next stay."
Stayed here before the attack ... The hotel was outmost luxury... The room are ok...But the ambiance the feel was all delightful...From check inns to room service.... Morning breakfast was too good... There are very good restaurant which are quite famous...Wrth Staying...
"Our stay at this hotel was perfect.  Everything was faultless, from the reception to the service and the food.  The location is also perfect, just by the sea, and just beside the Gateway of India.  All the facities are available.  Anything you want, you can get.  Worldclass hotel."
"This beautiful Palace hotel is elegant and luxurious. The service is wonderful, from the greeting using your name at the entrance, to the check in process with flowers, to the small and lovely extras in your room, to how quickly the team learns what you like so they can serve you better. The patio is my most favorite place for breakfast. Surrounded by gardens overlooking the pool, it is a quiet, elegant oasis from the craziness of the city. This is the true gem in Mumbai. Not easy to get to many appointments from here, but that is more a traffic issue I think - unavoidable where ever you stay, so you might as well stay where you can relax, eat well, and enjoy being pampered."
"I stayed for a day in Taj Palace along with my family on this May.It was my birthday, and I could find in my utter surprise that the room was decorated with balloons. Half of my monies spent was realised. The staff were excellent and caring. They even helped my family to cut a cake in the room. Evening we went to Gateway of India(an iconic tower in Mumbai) which is few steps from the hotel and had a splendid boat ride in the sea. Overall the memories were unforgettable."
"After 2 weeks in the north this was a welcome stay. We found a cheap deal but with that you get the cheap seats, its all comparative I suppose. We did get snubbed once by the concierge when we arrived as I suppose we were not fitting their image and he asked us if we stayed in the hotel judging books by covers and all that.   It was definitely what it was described as. Overall I was happy with it but I have stayed in nicer Only let down was the swimming pool. Will return"
"Amazing hotel. Beautiful facilities and rooms and very attentive staff. One of the best hotels I have stayed in. The pool and gym were very good and the breakfast in the sea lounge was very good.   The service from housekeeping was outstanding. I left my sunglasses on a bench, they put a glass cleaning cloth next to them. They tidied up my phone and iPad cords, put book marks in the magazine I was reading. Nothing was overlooked. Little notes to thank me and flowers in my room.   The staff in the palace lounge remembered me each night. Welcomed me and were very attentive.   Will definitely return. Best service of any hotel in India. "
"The Taj Mahal Palace is an absolutely amazing hotel that exceeded our expectations.  The service was superb, and the attention to detail within the hotel was second to none.  The food in the hotel was amazing and our favorite was the Indian restaurant.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to or passing through Mombai."
"Everything has been perfect at the Taj. After a month backpacking from Ladakh, Kashmir, Kerala, etc. with our 5 year old boy, what a treat to arrive at the Taj and be welcomed by the amazing staff at the front desk! The hotel is gorgeous as one could expect, but even more, the service and the staff make you feel like in a dream. The breakfast alongside the pool, the heritage visit of the Taj and the room, everything was perfect! It is worse 10 times the extra cost compare to nearby Colaba hotels if you can afford it! Don't hesitate, choose the Taj! The only downside... wifi is not free which surprised me a lot as it is everywhere else!"
you feel like 100 years back with the highest confort. to watch the storry of the Hotel on the TV is a must. We had great Food in the Japanese restorant and afterwards a Cocktail at the pool side with great Service.
The Taj Palace is an excellent place to stay in Mumbai. Located on the end of a small peninsular it has a fantastic vista facing the ocean. I had a room where I had full view of the ocean and watched a dramatic approach of a rain storm. The decor and room facilities are exemplary with all the details that made the stay pleasant and pampered. I enjoyed the blend of Indian and Western breakfast buffet. Staff were professional and friendly and couldn't do enough to make the stay one without trouble or care.
This hotel is excellent. I had a great stay 2013. bedrooms are clean an toilets are excellent. The beds are most comfortable. The service is excellent. Friendly staff.food is great.this is really a good palace to stay.
"This is truly one of the best hotels in the world.   Service is outstanding, food exquisite, rooms beautiful!  The hotel is certainly not inexpensive but it is worth every penny.  If you are going to Mumbai stay here!"
"On 19th and 20 July , had been to Hotel Taj for conference. It was a good experience. Conference was on 1st Flr - Crystal Hall. It was a massive hall , perfect for conference and can accomodate 200 people. Seating arrangements were very good and service top class. As far as food is concerned ...It was delicious. Cuisines in Lunch and Dinner were simply mouthwatering and tasty. Though the choice was by organizers but from soup to maincourse and desserts were very good. Even Starters combo of non-veg and veg dishes were delicious. It was a good experience in Hotel Taj . "
"Stayed at the palace wing of the Hotel for a night over the weekend. The property takes you back in time. There are star hotels and then there is The Taj. Checkin was smooth as could be, staff were very polite. It took them no more then 5 mins to show us to our room, while we waited at the Palace Lounge. There is beautiful artwork along the grand corridors. The room in itself with its high ceiling is a breath of fresh air in the madness of Mumbai. The humility of the  staff is the icing on the cake. Dont believe the comments on trip advisor that they are more polite to the firangs. This is an Indian property and it was built for the Indian. The staff treat you like you were the king of Bikaner. The quality of the morning breakfast was outstanding, and sitting overlooking the"
"A top of the line hotel with attentive staff, well furnished and kept rooms, and an excellent Indian restaurant. If you can, take the hotel tour available at 5pm daily. The concierge put together a great city tour package and everybody will go out of their way to help you--if nothing else than to give you a warm smile and hello."
"The Taj is a fabulous hotel! The staff friendly, kind, and efficient.  The Taj location, perfect, overlooking India Gate. Our room stunning. Our housekeeping staff, every attention to detail, nothing missed! Exemplary! We stayed in room 452 even though facing India gate, no noise! Beautiful room.  Thank you Taj for the comfortable luxury!"
"Stayed here recently on a business trip. I had a lovely room on the 19th floor overlooking the Gateway of India. Fantastic morning views.  Cannot speak of it highly enough. I've dined here often but have never had stayed at the hotel. This is a 5 star hotel that lives up to its reputation and more. The service from the front desk, to the bellman, to room service, the gym, and the service in the restaurants was fantastic. Also, the detail and care that is taken by the staff is unparalleled. You get the impression that they want to make sure that the customer feels special, and that they are willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen. This is a place that exudes class. I don't think I have every been happier with a hotel than the Taj Bombay."
"Always carried a secret desire to stay in this historic and mind-boggling property! Thanks to my employers, had one in 2009 for three days. And it was sheer pleasure and pride to have enjoyed a room view which opened up to The Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea. My advice---enjoy the comforts but don't indulge much in varieties of food as their buffet is damn sufficient and good...Else you may end up paying a fortune in the restaurants! But recommended at any time of the day :-)"
This historic hotel has all the opulence and impeccable service you'd expect from the Taj brand.  The club lounge has somewhat restrictive hours but serves some great hot appetizers and delicious mixed drinks.  The location is great for seeing the city and is adjacent to India Gate.
"I have had the honour of visiting this excellent establishment a few times & everytime I do so I'm blown away.  The last time I walked into this hotel the concierge looked up and said - Welcome to your second home Mr Liebenberg - need I say more, I was blown away.  That is the level of service you receive from this fine hotel over & over again. I love the old world charm and modern technology combined in this grand old dame.  Next you are in Mumbai this is the place to stay, forget the other hotels, this is the best !!!  Take my word for it.  Kind regards  Ferdie Liebenberg"
"As a newly engaged couple backpacking through India we threw caution out of the window and opted for a night of opulence to celebrate. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 5th floor with a great view of the grounds. The upgrade included afternoon tea, cocktails, chocolate and cognac tasting and the free tour -  make the effort to do the tour as it's only when you're on the tour that you realise how iconic this building is. When you've back packed around India, it's a bit odd paying London prices for beer and food but that quickly goes away as you're staying in one of the most luxurious hotels in India with a great selection of top notch eateries to suit whatever mood you may be in. We stayed there one night and didn't leave the grounds as there was so much to"
"This really is an amazing hotel. It feels really special, exclusive and is steeped in history - I'd recommend doing the hotel tour which is free, it's brilliant and the guy who presents it should be an actor!  The rooms in the palace wing are a little dated but it's a palace building so is to be expected. Food was ok, nothing special, great cocktails and service. The waiters/waitresses in the club lounge were very sweet and efficient. The one real negative is the manicure I had, I could have done better myself (they leave the cuticles on and paint over them?!) and the girls at reception were very giggly and not very professional. The gym is perfect, lots of equipment and cold - perfect!  Overall, one of a kind hotel"
"Stayed for 2 nights on business 24-25 June and came away disappointed.First time Ive stayed since 2007 and wont be rushing back.As you would expect,security was exceptionally high on approaching the hotel which was reassuring. The room was rather dull and dingy,whilst the bathroom was in need of a major refurb.There was no seperate shower and basically felt like a typical rubbish UK 4 start hotel. The service in the bars/restaurant was very good although expensive for what it was. They really need to up there game and take a lesson from Taj Lands End.Will try Oberoi or similar next time,its such a shame as I use to really like it here."
We started our holiday in Mumbai for 5 days and this was our first visit to India. We later moved on to the Leela hotel in Goa.  Upon our arrival which was early a.m. before daybreak we were given a room with a sea view in the Tower section of the hotel. The room had a bad odour smell and the following day we complained and were transferred to a deluxe room on a higher floor. These rooms are similar to a typical Premier Inn in UK and are definitely not 5 star. These rooms require refurbishing to bring the Tower section of the hotel back to good standard. The old part of the hotel is spectacular and reminded me of our stay at Raffles in Singapore. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. The Zodiac restaurant is excellent and should not be missed. The Health Spa provided an
"Was concerned the rooms would be outdated and although the tower room was not large, it was bright, extremely comfortable and had a great view.  Would not now stay anywhere else in Mumbai, great position and excellent service."
"I have stayed there for 2 Nights with my friends and returned with big smile. I found the true meaning of Hospitality in TAJ. They pamper you like anything !!!! We have booked City View Room and while we checked in they immediately upgrade us to Sea View Room.Breakfast was good. All the facilities was well backed up by excellent service. The staff was attentive all the time and ready to serve almost all your needs !!  Interestingly Our all requests were met! Like sea view room - Late Checkout etc. Initially I did  not found Shaving Kit and Toothbrush-paste in bathroom, but on call they provided the same. I must recommend and will come back again in Taj Mahal Palace ."
"Read quite a few good reviews before I decided to stop by Sea Lounge on Taj Palace Mumbai for high tea. It is buffet style cost 1500 INR per head. The price includes tea pot for each person  The waiter automatically poured water for us without asking. At the end, there was an extra 200 INR charge for water.  Indeed there is no really need for water since there is self serve ice tea as well. The variety of food are quite many which includes street food in a fancy way. There are only about 5 tables near window which can overlook Gateway India. If you don't get those tables, there is nothing special about this place. I expected nicer dinning sets, tea pot but unfortunately it is a quite normal / plain one. "
"We had a beautiful sea facing room in palace ( old section) of this hotel, and the experience was truly extraordinary, largely thanks to the attentive room staff and other staff. You are made to feel , like a movie star in this hotel, the staff think of your needs before you do.  We booked a room I the tower section of the hotel, this was originally a separate hotel, not part of the Taj Mahal  palace, it was taken over and joined to the hotel some years ago. The section referred to as the towers was built in 1940s. It is very substandard compared with the rest of the hotel, but also very cheap.  When the house made saw we used eye glasses, clothes for wiping the lenses were left for us, when they noted we had computer cables, velcroe cable ties were installed for us. The list"
"As a hotelier, I am familiar with the day to day running of a hotel. The Taj Palace, Mumbai lived up to all expectations of five star service. I travel extensively for business and pleasure and was made to feel so special by all staff that I came in contact with. Special mention must go to the housekeeping staff that took care of all our needs. They were discreet yet attentive and so considerate! To The Deputy housekeeper, Ms Shruti Daruka and the entire team, thank you for teaching me what service excellence is all about. Needless to say, my stay was unforgettable and I look forward to returning. My husband and I stayed for 6 nights until 10 June 2014.  Couglan and Niranjini Pather"
"Stayed with my wife at the Palace Wing for a day to celebrate my birthday. To say that the Taj Palace is merely a hotel is an injustice to the property. The warm & friendly staff, the welcome at the Palace Lounge with its stunning range of contemporary Indian Art was a pre cursor to the rest of the stay. We thoroughly enjoyed spoiling ourselves at the Harbour Bar for a drink and then moving on to the Wasabi for its fabulous Japanese cuisine. The room was large and the butler service was very good. The only jarring note was that even on the fifth floor the sound insulation was not good enough to keep out the raucous street noise typical in Bombay. The hotel, with its exquisite Indian styling skilfully interwoven with modern facilities,is truly a majestic property. For someone who"
The hotel is unique in terms of its location and history. It is definitely worth to stay here for some part of your holiday to Mumbai. However I did feel it is a bit overpriced and there are many other 5* luxury hotels close by which provide a similar / better overall service. That said everything at the hotel itself was of a high standard with good a breakfast and clean rooms.
It is not just a hotel. It is a concept. An experience of ROYALTY.When you walk into the hotel you are walking into the beauty of Indian History. They take care of every smallest needs that you my have. Definitely planing to go back again in the future. Upgraded our room as we have been there on our 40th marriage anniversary. They prepared the room with rose petals and balloons for us. It was so sweet. This is a truly world class hotel.
"This hotel is wonderful , a stay you will never forget , I have been staying at this hotel from 1996 but I this time I was at the hotel after a long time  lets say after the attack on the hotel , the staff is just as cheerful and the hotel is just a lovely place to stay the breakfast is well balanced in terms of quality and menu. I strongly recommend travellers visiting Mumbai India must stay at this wonderful hotel and enjoy the morning or evening walks on the beach have a coffee at the lounge or just eat in on of its excellent dining options ."
"The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai was our last stay before departing on a Seabourn Cruise to the Middle East & Rome. When we realised we had the option of boarding in Mumbai, there was only one hotel we considered and this hotel more than met our expectations. Everything we had arranged through the hotel from the aiport pickup to the guide arranged for us to our dinner reservations and departure was undertaken faultlessly, again by people who cared about their hotel and its reputation. Our large suite looked straight over the Gateway to India and was in absolutely perfect order and condition more than commensurate with our expectations. The history of this hotel again reinforces its place in India's world status. Meals at Masala Kraft and Sea Lounge were in keeping with the reputation"
"Awesome experience when staying at The Taj Mahal Palace. Very unique, Excellent atmosphere, and the staff's are really friendly. Their Reception area is well decorated with real flowers, I like it very much.  Welcome: They treat every guests very well from the entry, with flowers and Thilak(Indian style welcome), i feel very happy about their welcome.  Rooms: Based on my request they upgraded to sea view rooms, rooms are very pleasant and cool, watching Gateway of India from the room is really good, rooms has all those facilities, and an excellent kind of bath area.  Surprise: It was my spouse birthday, when knowing this, The Taj staffs decorated the rooms with balloons, flowers, etc., When entering the rooms we really feel good and surprised, their guest relations team is"
"It was a 2 day halt in Mumbai  from an international trip, before we headed back to Pune. We got palace side room and later upgraded to sea view and let me tell you that was amazing. The luxury oozes out from every bit of the thing you see. I loved the TV concept that they have got embedded in the mirror. All the restaurants are world class. Last but not the least, please do the heritage tour that happens everyday at 5. And it will take you back in time. Hats off to the Experience Manager who speaks 32 languages from world and has an amazing style of story telling. The grand paintings and royal interior will remain with you until you arrive there again. Super impressed. Wah Taj !"
"The Taj is an amazing hotel. I was in a Palace room which was just beautiful. The common areas in the hotel are also stunning. The room was very well equipped with every item you might need thought through. Good bed, great bathroom. Breakfast in the Sea Lounge was excellent. The staff had been fantastic."
Very attentive service.    Nicely decorated rooms.   Fantastic restaurant -- try Kamala Kraft.  Have breakfast or tea at the Sea Lion.  The location is terrific.  Ultimately it's the attentiveness of the staff that really makes this hotel special.
"There is no other hotel associate with Mumbai as the Taj Mahal Palace.  The location is perfect for visitor to the city.  The wide open frontage facing the Gateway of India is an impressive sight.  The services starting with the warm welcome from the impressive doormen to its beautiful decorated lobby and a team of staff that make the palace come to life.  Unfortunately we can give further review on the hotel since we visited as a tourist without staying in.  We came to Mumbai with a cruise ship and simply went there for a visit as part of our sightseeing stops.  However from the overall facilities, location, liveliness, and services, the Taj Mahal Palace will be our number 1 choice for our next visit."
"After reading many negative reviews on this hotel I was a little hesitant to book a room, but I finally took the plunge and I do not regret it! The prices are not so high when compared to a hotel of the same category in Europe or the USA. Rates are lower than a hotel unpretentious, without sea view, without the multitude of services offered at East Bay in St. Martin for example. The staff are lovely. Nothing to report about my room"
"I had a stay of 3 nights during my first visit to India, it was really an amazing experience, staying at the hotel was the only thing I wanted to do. the service was really very good and the team was really friendly, even they helped me in wearing the sari for my friend's wedding :) and the best part is that my room was facing Gate of India - I don't mind to travel to India just to stay at Taj Mahal Palace - I love it"
"The most attentive staff and personal service second to none. I have stayed in many top class hotels around the world, but this beats them all.My room was in the main Palace section and it was nice to have your own personal lounge with waiter service for those staying in the Palace wing only. Breakfast by the pool was a nice distraction, although a bit humid. The main breakfast area had a bit of a cafeteria feel about it. Next day took breakfast in the Sea Lounge and was 100% better. Overall, a fantastic stay. "
"Stayed at the Taj Palace on several trips to bombay... Great architecture of the British Raj... Luxurious, clean, pleasing and ofcourse the impeccable service one expects from this establishment and from the TAJ chain in general... The main building is just beautiful and the lounges are great... en fin :superbe...."
"Mumbai was my very first stop on my month long tour of India. My first place to stay in was the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel ... This Grand Dame of hotels has so much history and so much class. I was welcomed with a nice cool drink, a lei garland, and a bindi to introduce me to the beautiful culture of India. Our room on the 4th floor ( the smallest) was gigantic and well appointed. It had a lovely view of the pool side and gardens of the hotel. The bathroom was gigantic with separate shower and bathtub, and the amenities were first class. I couldn't stop using all their lotions as it smelt and felt divine. The bed was super comfortable and the linen was equally lovely. The service is just out of this world!!! How people remember your name in such a large place is beyond me, but they"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is undoubtedly one of the most iconic and well known hotels in the heart of Colaba area a few meters from the marina and the Gateway of India. This structure appears in the section of the hotel but personally I would place this also among the attractions of the city being a very nice and architecturally beautiful structure in the colonial style it is a luxurious 5 star hotel. The entrance is surveilled all the time by guards, I tried to get in and I managed it without any problems, you can walk along the luxurious reception and there are also some shops. Also here you will see numerous photos of famous people who have stayed here, including Hollywood actors, singers and some United States Presidents. A half-hour visit, interesting place that is worth the"
"It was just an amazing stay, when I did not like the room that they allocate us, we were quickly transferred to the rooms in palace wing. It was my birthday and I was greeted upon arrival with a birthday cake and once again given a birthday cake at the restaurant (Zodiac Grill). Everything is perfect! I would love to come back and stay in another room type."
"The service was almost impeccable.  Everyone was polite and extremely helpful.  It was my birthday on the last day we were there - I was greeted by more ""happy birthday"" than I can remember.  They left flowers and balloons in my room as a surprise and I even got a birthday cake (delicious one nonetheless) from the hotel!  That, to me, was customer experience at its very best.    Now - the room.  Sadly, I can't say the same about the room.  We took a deluxe room in the Palace Wing with sea view - which was what most of the reviews had recommended.  When we arrived and got to our room at 3 in the morning, we were greeted with the strongest odor, of dust, humidity… just musty. It was stifling.  I called the front desk immediately and was told that there isn't much they could do. "
"We booked a Deluxe Room with a sea view at the Palace Wing, and on our arrival we've been informed by the hotel management that we've been upgraded to a Garden View Suite! it was spacious, a suite with a living room, dinning room, bedroom, and a huge bathroom. Most interestingly the lovely bathtub, separate from the toilet, with two sinks. The heritage building was fabulous and full of indian culture. Gateways of India in the opposite side of the hotel. Hotel staff were courteous and very helpful. I highly recommend staying at the Palace (Heritage) wing, of course you don't get the beautiful experience if you stay at the Tower Wing! it's like staying in a different hotel. The breakfast at the Sea Lounge was amazing. Fresh breads, your choice of eggs, selection of cheeses, and"
"The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai is a true wonder of the World. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay to the max. While the food is a bit pricey, the pool and spa are world class. The staff as well as truly world class; everyone made us feel like royalty with a genuine touch.   I'd like to call specific attention to one of the conceirge...Kane Lillywhite.   My girlfriend left her pursue on the Air India flight from Delhi to Jaipur a few days prior to our flying to Mumbai. After several failed attempts, we simply gave up on trying to locate and retrieve the lost pursue as the airline representatives clearly had no intention of lifting a finger.   When we got to the Taj in Mumbai, we approach the concierge desk and met Kane. We explained the situation. Kane tried calling Air India and"
"Nice refuge from the heat and cool to stroll around the hotel to see pictures of diplomats and celebrities who have stayed here before. Because I was here in Dec, they had some Christmas decorations up, which made it feel more like home. You kind of forget you're in India when you're in here.   Food was just average. I had a steak and it was nothing to write home about. We had been traveling in India for a while and I was looking for some western food for a change. Even in an upscale setting, it doesn't seem like you'll be able to find what you're looking for in terms of western cuisine - it just doesn't taste the same. However, the tea was delicious and they give you your own personal mini teapot. Service was good but not fast (business as usual).   A side note, the lobby"
"This iconic hotel lives up to its worldwide reputation. It will make any visit to India special and show you just how great a hotel can be. This was my second time, having tagged on a couple of days to a business trip, and I was not disappointed. If you can push the budget, go for the Palace wing with its butler service and views of the gateway to India. This is truly a special experience which you will not forget.   The cuisine, the magnificent setting, the tranquillity of the breathtaking pool area, the calmness of the Tea lounge , they all take you back to a bygone era of luxury. And yet you're not in some bland five star bubble, you really have a sense of where you are in the world and feel connected to a part of Indian heritage when you stay here.   In summary, faultless -"
"As the name says it all. Nice rooms still have the old feel. It was a business trip and I was in the hotel all through out for a conference, Everything about the property is great just that the building from outside calls for repairs. Food is great. Staff excellent. It's one of the best we all know."
"Attentive front desk and hotel staff who are eager to please and really make your stay special. Fabulous ""sea-view"" room that includes the bustling sea-wall tourists, the harbour and India Gate. Great location to visit historic buildings, business district, museums, shopping, restaurants and as a base for getting around the city. Beautifully appointed lounges and elegant restaurants serving a variety of cuisines; delicious food served in all venues. Stunning outdoor pool and dining areas. Special privileges for Taj-Club members. Overall, a wonderful, 5-star experience that should not be missed."
"The Taj is a special experience.  Location and rooms are wonderful, but what sets this hotel apart from any other is their customer service:   every little detail, every issue is addressed, from recognizing birthdays to scoring tickets for a sold out cricket match.  The afternoon tea, pool and gym are also wonderful, but again, stay at this hotel because it flat out has the best customer service on earth."
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal at the end of April, where i understand it's very quiet at that time. We had booked two rooms in the tower, which did not fare so well in the reviews so i wasn't sure what to expect but we never got the chance to find out. We were upgraded as soon as we arrived and the rooms we were given had the most amazing view of the gate to india and the sea. Not only that, the furnishings and quality of the amenities in the room were equivalent to a London, UK 5 Star hotel. I was in heaven. The walk in shower was the size of my bathroom at home and the bed was one of the most comfortable i've ever slept in. Sadly we stayed for just one night before moving on, arriving late and departing at dinner time the following day. The service was exceptional, and made the"
"I was lucky to be upgraded to stay at the Palace and this made the difference from staying at a luxury hotel (the new modern tower) to staying at a stunning place. Just taking the magnificent staircase makes you feel like a princess. Getting into your room and being welcomed by your buttler is an unforgottable experience. The staff is so helpful and friendly that you feel pampered from the very moment you get into the lobby.  Every time you get into your room there is a new surprise, a new flower arrangement, a piece of suede to clean your specs... you are really being taken care of! Rooms are spacious, confortable and with all necessary appliances. Not to miss the tour around the palace and a lunch by the swimming pool. Relaxing at one of the many deck chairs at the pool is"
"Definitely among the leading hotels of the world!  And a real refuge from the rest of Mumbai.  This is money well spent for an oasis in the heat.  Lovely pool, great restaurants, many many nice touches including a set of  ""solo lady traveller amenities"" (silk scarf, jewelry).   Take the 5 pm tour of hotel with charming Viren....Ask for a room overlooking Gateway of India.  Service is outstanding and there is a real pride and dignity in all staff.  Concierges are solicitous and detail-oriented.  The business centre is great and always includes an offer of any kind of beverage. Beds and linens are excellent. I wish I could move in!"
"We've been lucky enough to travel extensively in India but we always enter and leave via Mumbai and always stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Wing (except in Dec 2008 for well known reasons). It really is a home from home with the exquisite decoration, beautiful rooms, great service and fantastic staff that really do go out of their way to make you feel welcome. One of the best hotels in the world and the very sympathetic renovations in 2009 managed to retain the cart majority of the charm of the original hotel."
"What an amazing hotel, had seen pictures before my visit but they didn't do it justice. If in Mumbai this is a must. It had plenty of places to eat & drink without leaving the hotel. Had a wonderful experience.Great location. "
"This magnificent historic property is delightful, beautifully maintained and exquisite. It offers state of the art in amenities without sacrificing any of the charm.  Service is first rate, food is excellent and location is prime.   Can't wait to return"
"I recently was on a business trip in Mumbai, former Bombay. I stayed a couple of days in this hotel. The hotel is located in a nice area of the city, was a bit far away from the office (regarding traffic) The hotel offers fine restaurant. We had an excellent dinner in the Indian Restaurant. The room had a view on the gate of India. Some dogs could be heard basking outside (earlier night)  Would stay again in this hotel"
"The Taj is majestic the minute you pull up outside the front of the hotel and see the Gateway to India. The welcome at reception is all class and the foyer is large but almost intimate in its feel.  I stayed on three occasions in a short period and had a room facing the Gateway and two other rooms that did not. All of the rooms were immaculate and the bathrooms although smaller than modern hotels beautifully appointed and clean.  Internet had to be paid for but the connection was fast an reliable.   Breakfast was busy and it is best not to leave it until the later time slots. The choice of food should satisfy most palates. Service was excellent, although on one day the sheer volume of guests meant that service was slower than usual.   The memorial to those who lost their lives"
"passed quickly through Mumbai but had dinner here. The food is good, catering for many cuisines (great for kids missing home comforts). The service, impeccable. The decor, magnificent.  We will definitely spend more time here next time."
"This is one of the best properties I have stayed so far. The hotel staffs are so cordial and caring , at times you will feel that you are staying at your own home.i am overwhelmed by the graceful courtesy extended to me and my family during my stay on 24th May."
"Spent 4 nights in a suite (Dolphin) overlooking the Gateway of India. The hotel is magnificent, the service outstanding down to the tinest detail. Staff is extremely nice and careful and deserves a special mention in itself. If you want to feel the flavour of luxury in India - indeed a fundamental aspect of this country together with extreme poverty, but most of the charm of India lies in its neighbouring contrasts - this is the place to be."
This hotel is stunning. It feels very historic in terms of its colonial history but also in terms of its recent part in the terrorist attacks (for which there is a nice memorial tree and fountain). Great service and nice sized rooms. An incredible set of restaurants. Try the scratch menu in the curry restaurant and the sushi is nice (if a little expensive).
"This was my third time in mumbai , with 8 years gap in between each trip.  Everything about the Taj was just right. It wasn't too modern, yet not too ancient. The food was magnificent. The service was very personal.  And the garden by the pool was my favourite place. I am not the sort of tourist who just lie by the pool, but there I did. It was so peaceful.  Only downside, on one of the nights, there was a wedding at the hotel and it was far too noisy till 3am."
"The service and accommodation at the Taj could not have been better during our stay. The hotel was comfortable and all staff went out of their way to be sure every detail of luxury was covered. It stood out for India in terms of cleanliness and service. And the tea lounge was an excellent touch of class, as we always had a place to sit and relax over tea, which was included in our stay. The breakfast buffet was also wonderful, and our server even had the kitchen prepare us typical Indian breakfast dishes, as it was our first experience with the cuisine.  The only disappointment we faced was that we were on our honeymoon, and with all the excitement my new husband and I accidentally scheduled and prepaid for the hotel twice. Unfortunately, the hotel said it was not their problem,"
"Amazing property, attentive and friendly staff, great food and tea, clean. I booked two nights here upon arriving for my first trip to India, and wanted to stay for longer.  I'm looking forward to my next stay here when I head out of the country in a few months. It was one of the best hotel experiences I've had anywhere."
"My customer experience with the Taj Mahal Palace begins at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport Terminal 2 - seriously a great airport.  I understand Terminal 2 recently opened for operations and hope they can maintain level of service throughout.  It took an hour or so to get to the Taj via the hotel’s vehicle service.  The Taj’s facade is colonial in design and reminds me of Manila Hotel in the Philippines and Raffles Hotel in Singapore.  Arriving at 11:00 PM, we were greeted by hotel reception at the driveway.  Maybe it was the late hour, maybe it was the traffic - I lost my bearings on the way to the Palace wing reception area.  We were received a room upgrade and handed a key.  A key!  Seemed to be a digital key with no visible millings or grooves but I personally"
marvel of mumbai this place deserves all the accolades for the way it has kept its aura...great service and food...had visited this place with my family some time back..the rooms are well done up.....
"My stay was extremely pleasant as we were traveling in a group of 3 across the south and South West of India. We have covered in total 4,909 KM in 4 days staying in 4 different hotels in 3 cities...this was the best.  I will be back one day and stay there with my kids for a week at least....  Truly enjoyable"
"If anyone can find a better hotel than the Taj then I would love to visit. It has been 18 months since we visited here, and every time we stay somewhere else memorable we come away saying ""excellent, but not as good as the Taj.""  The setting, the history, the story, the service and the restaurants inside - simply wow. When staff visited us in our room we were showered with gifts and a wonderfully natural level of service. Staff love working here and it shows.   Be sure to visit Souk and Wasabi Morimoto during your stay. My wife mentions the sushi at Wasabi every time we try sushi elsewhere, and the taste of the Middle East at Souk is just divine.  We can't wait to go back. I would visit India again purely to stay here. Simply incredible."
"It was our turn to pay for treat and so we had lunch at the hotel......'Ouch.!!'. Gosh it cost. What a lovely experience however. Excellent food and incredible service, the rooms are decorated luxuriously and nothing is too much trouble, we had a long afternoon there.....................it felt like luxury and it sure was. If you have had tea at the Ritz then you must have lunch here."
"Staying at the Taj is more about heritage and charm of the historic property.  It is said everyone knows about and most indians aspire to stay at the taj once in their lifetime....  I have seen the hotel over the last few years and it has a 100 year old legacy to show.  its a top noth experience of staying, dining here.  the new renovated rooms, more and more exciting food options in the restaurants are always innovating  Wasabi the restaurant now is amongst the best in India and Asia and has been awarded the same.  This is a must go place for sheer nostalgia sakes"
"Superb hotel, courteous staff, the Palace / Heritage wing is the only place to be if one is staying at the hotel.  The restaurants, specifically Wasabi by Morimoto and Masala Kraft & Starboard (restaurants frequented by me) serve exceptional food,"
Well I don't think my review will make much of a difference but this hotel is simply fantastic . I have stayed in many luxurious hotels but this is just pure pleasure to stay at . It's expensive for sure but I think it's worth every penny . I was there for work and believe me every time I was about to leave the hotel I was sad mainly because I dint want to encounter mumbai's traffic and at the same time. Didn't want to leave the comfort of this place. This hotel is amazing I think the staff is very professional and experienced. It has it's heritage restored with the beautiful building and then food is so amazing as well . No complains at all from this hotel.
first stayed in hotel in my own city mumbai. upgraded to suite in the old wing of taj. service is just superb right from check-in to room service. only thing it is a long walk . the suite was amazing and was at the end of corridor. the sizes of room are over 70 sq mts and they have lounge on ground floor which is open 24 hours.
This hotel is excellent. I had a great stay.da bedrooms are clean an toilets are excellent. The beds are most comfortable. The service is excellent. Friendly staff.food is great.this is really a palace.no doubt
"I traveled to Mumbai on the 14th April and stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai. this hotel was simply magnificent. i stayed in the Heritage wing of the hotel which has a charm of its own. the staff and service were excellent with everyone going out of the way to make my stay a memorable one. I enjoyed the Hi-tea served at the sea lounge restaurant with plenty to eat including the famous Mumbai street food, except that it was prepared in a very hygienic kitchen. Because of my frequent stays at the Taj group of hotels , the management upgraded me to a Junior suite. This has massive rooms overlooking the Arabian Sea and the famous Gateway of India. The hotel has a magnificent spa and offered Yoga lessons every morning which I thoroughly enjoyed. The hotel is situated in the"
"A perfect hotel to stay for a special occasion, especially in the Palace Wing. Located next to many good restaurants, shopping areas ( both high-end/street). This hotel relaxes you and showcases the best of Mumbai. The colonial history, vibrance and modernity."
"The art of combining all the right experiences to create the perfect fusion of senses has been mastered by the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai. From the collection at the airport, the drive, the arrival, the reception, the check in, the room/suite and your stay is just an Incredible. My stay at the palace two weeks ago was just that. Not even the slow rotation of the revolving door at the entrance can prepare you for the experience on the other side. Reflections in the class of poverty, traffic, hordes of people going about the daily lives and the intense heat hanging onto you desperately not to let go is all gone once you step out of the revolving door. You have arrived and they know it too. The sense of style, comfort and aroma is overwhelming. You are escorted by a very"
"We stayed in the original  palace part of the hotel.  Our room was elegant, comfortable and spacious.  When our room was serviced on either the first or second night of our stay a number of little ""gifts "" were left for us ~ it was a really nice, personalised touch! We opted for the ""club floor"" package which gives you access to complimentary afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks with nibbles, both of which are served by waiters wearing white gloves in a gorgeous old parlour.  A  really memorable experience.   The breakfast buffet, which is served in a different yet equally charming parlour, offers a wide range of choices.  Another benefit of the club floor is that room service fresh fruit is available as and when you like - 24/7.   Staff were friendly and super attentive, nothing"
"I arrived on my birthday and, after noting that it was my birthday from my passport, the magic began.  I was upgraded to a gorgeous Palace room with the most beautiful  marble bathroom.  The room was extremely elegant and very spacious.  I then went out to shop and upon my return my room was covered in balloons, rose petals, a bunch of red roses and a gorgeous floral arrangement.  If that wasn't enough, Zeena from Guest Relations arrived with a beautiful chocolate mousse birthday cake and card and she and the butler sang happy birthday to me.  We took photos and a few days after leaving I received an email from Guest Relations with a collage of photos taken by the staff.  What a birthday.  The friendliness and professionalism of the staff is wonderful - nothing  was too much"
"We stayed a number of days in the new wing and then, after a side trip, some days in the old ""palace"" wing.  This hotel is typical of its class around the world – old grand major city hotels with a grandeur in the older lobbies and more typical modern appearance to the new grand entry on a newer wing, and about as good as it’s likely to get in Mumbai.  In the fashion of ritzy places, they charge for Wi-Fi in an environment where hovels offer it for free, but that's about what's expected,   That said, you can expect an incredible attention to personal service.  I had been warned that getting an Indian SIM chip for my mobile phone was equally difficult.  Well, fortunately the business center in the hotel came to the rescue and helped facilitate this.  It involved passport photos,"
"I loved this hotel.  Everthing, from the 'in-room' check-in, the upgrade from a basic room to a seaview, the breakfasts, the staff, the location and the wonderful view over 'The Gateway' was perfect.  The ferry to Elephanta Island is directly across the road from the entrance to the hotel."
the ocean view is really good. The food is amazing really good food specially the pizzas and they have a chocolate cake which is really good.The hotel is really well maintained and looks amazing!!!!!!
"If you can afford it, don't bother with anywhere else, this is the place to stay.  The facilities, as you would expect at a five star hotel, are top notch.  The bed is obscenely soft, the view of India gate was fabulous (and a pleasant free upgrade) and the gym, spa and pool are great.  But the real reason you should stay here, is the EXPERIENCE.  You are not just a guest, you are part of a family, and this starts from the genuine smiles on all the staff to the fantastic daily tour of the history of the place by Viren (AWWWWWESOME!!!!).  I truly felt like I had a big brother in Mumbai, and I am so grateful to have spent my last night in India at this amazing institution.  Oh, and the breakfast buffet is mindblowing."
"I recently stayed at 'the Taj' and she certainly lives up to her reputation as one of the most renowned hotels in the world.  The old building is quite spectacular, and the service attentive but not imposing.  However, as I was staying here for business, I must say that this is not the ideal hotel for this purpose.  Firstly, internet access is not included in the room rate, which is quite bizarre for a hotel of this stature, in this day and age.  Additional charges for wifi went out the door many years ago.  What next, an internet café in the lobby?  Secondly, the location at the end of a long peninsula, in the colonial heart of old Bombay, next to the Gateway of India, is perfect for tourism, but it is a long slog in the Mumbai traffic to attend meetings in the business"
Was fortunate to gain an upgrade on a long stay visit. The ocean view we enjoyed was amazing. The beds are soooooo comfortable and breakfast variety wonderful - loved the baked curd!  Perfect position on the waterfront of Colaba easy walk to many attractions. Book your stay on their website if staying 3 days or longer there are very good deals including possible upgrades where available. Wifi works with great speed too. Great place!
I stayed on the original Palace side of the hotel in a fabulous room including butler service.  I requested fresh flowers in the room upon arrival...and they were there and they were amazing and I don't even recall being billed for them.  Breakfast included in the lounge overlooking the sea and white glove service in the am...impressive.  A short coming here was the service at the pool.  At 10pm one night I headed outside to enjoy a cocktail and some fresh air but had to chase down a waiter...then had to chase him down again because of the long delay in being served.  It wasn't all that busy but the wait staff were in no rush and seemed somewhat confused.  Overall the hotel and restaurant options are spectacular and I'd fly back to Mumbai to have the hotel experience again.
"We stayed at this hotel recently for a conference. Its a premier luxury hotel. Everything here is just luxury and you feel like a king. The hospitality is superb, the food is superb, the location is superb. The hotel is century old, but perfectly maintained. They have a tower wing and a heritage wing. We stayed at the Heritage wing and luckily got a sea facing room as well, and we could see the beauty of Arabian sea from our room. The rooms are though small, but comfortable for two. The bathroom was spacious. The hotel staff is so nice, they take care of even your minutest requirement. Our room was cleaned twice in a day, and once I saw a bookmark in a book I was reading, placed by the hotel staff. Even our phone chargers were also nicely packed and kept in place by the staff."
"Best massage I have ever received, best service, great food! Location is also nice, attention to detail and variety of options for lunch&dinner. Breakfast is a must! It is my favorite meal and I was not disappointed!!"
"I stayed at the old wing of the Taj Mahal Palace and it was a fantastic experience and the hospitality of this hotel is incredible. The breakfast is great and all the restaurant serve good food. A good tips is that Indigo restaurant right behind the Taj serve great lunches and dinners.  If you want to feel royal, stay here."
All compliments must go to the management and staff at the Taj Palace who ensure that regular clients needs are catered for. The GM and his management must be complimented for their attention to detail and the manner in which they go about meeting client needs.  The rooms were excellent and the service was out of the world . All our personal requirements and bookings were impeccably handled and this is tantamount to the passion that the GM demonstrates on a day to day basis.  On the day that we checked out the GM allowed us to stay in our suite until midnight without charging us and this once again was highly appreciated by my family and I I
"went for an ultrasound conference , simply loved the place , good vibes ,excellent ambience ,  too good interiors , very well maintained , beautifully done up . Hotel staff  extremely well behaved and courteous , showing ultimate hospitality . Reception staff very cooperative , we wanted the sea facing room and were obliged .  Food was very good . want to go back again ,soon . want to always stay in the Taj group"
Stayed here for a night in the old wing and was spell bound by its beauty and amazing renovation done post terrorist attacks. Must add that it has not lost its old world charm.  The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai is a ideally located hotel in southern mumbai. And as usual service was exemplary.  Kudos and keep up the great work
"a beautiful hotel.nice ambience and ultimate hospitality. necessarily have to stay in the old wing with heritage rooms,lobbies and staircases. the tower building is also good but if u need the taj feel..have to stay in the old wing. souk at 22nd floor gives a wonderful view of the gateway of india must see."
"My wife and I spent one night at the Taj and only wish we could have stayed a few more. When we arrived mid morning our room was not available but the reception clerk immediately took us to the club lounge and offered us coffee, tea and sweet rolls plus the morning English papers. After about 35 minutes we were taken to our beautifully appointed rooms where we registered etc.Baggage immediately followed. Not two minutes had passed before a room service waiter appeared with fresh fruit and water. We did not have a view of the Gate to India but that did not matter as our room was quiet and bright. Wow the pool area is extraordinary and huge with attendants making sure one has lots of towels etc.The hotel has excellent security and is well located.....walking distance to The Gate"
"We stayed here in an oasis overlooking the Gateway to India and the chaos of traffic, crowds, humidity and heat, crumbling footpaths, horses and carts, smells and exotic colours that define India.  This would probably be the best part of Mumbai as a traveller as the beachside hotels and shops seemed little different from elsewhere.  There are good restaurants of all budgets nearby and great street markets to home bartering skills. The 'Taj' is worth a visit to see the foyer with its exquisite flowers and piano player as well as the incredible passing parade of business people and travellers from elsewhere in the nation, Asia, Middle East, Europe and America.  The wonderful buffet breakfast certainly reflected their needs. The pool and garden was an amazing sojourn from the"
"I do not know where to start on how amazing this hotel is.ltne history of the hotel... our hotel driver was great to the greetings. And pointed out all the sites of mumbai. If you stay, spend more and stay at the old part if the hotel, you won't regret spending  the cash! To having access to the palace lounge, the staff there are so friendly, one guy called shiraja & a girl who were amazing! The service was amazing, breakfast okay but staff great. The pool area was bliss and again staff was great handing water, it was 39degrees. My mother in law went to the spa which was amazing. The rooms were lush, clean and everything we walked to our room all the staff greeted us. I hope to return to the taj, or heaven very very soon! Lid What I would like to see more of is see the guest tip"
"This stunning hotel is really worth a visit - we were given a free upgrade and because it was our honeymoon we had a huge surprise cake with flowers in our room. Rooms were spacious, opulent and comfortable. Despite the central location, the rooms are very quiet and peaceful and the views of the Gateway of India and the sea from some of the rooms are fantastic - you could just stand there and watch for hours. Many major tourist attractions are very nearby.  The staff were very courteous and helpful and the hotel had all the facilities and amenities you would expect from a hotel of this grade."
"I wish I had more than one night to enjoy this hotel.  The service is outstanding, and having eaten in the Golden Dragon restaurant, that food was delicious.  Room was luxurious, with velvet, dark wood and superb cotton, and the bathroom with marble bath and walk in shower is worth a linger!       "
"This is a beautiful hotel.  We originally booked the Tower Wing but received a free upgrade to the Palace Wing.  This hotel is one of the most lovely I have stayed in and if your budget doesn't extend to the Palace Wing, stay in the less expensive rooms and still enjoy the hotel surroundings.  It really is value for money when you consider the cost of similar standard hotels in western countries.  The service was impeccable and we enjoyed the free 5pm tour of the hotel and also the high tea which is $35 per person offering a large range of delightful sweet and savoury options, including Indian favourites.  We just loved our time here and didn't want to leave."
"In many ways, this is a great hotel.  The location next to the Gateway of India, in hisotric Mumbai, situated on the sea, with proximity to shopping, is ideal.  The outer appearance is a visual amenity.  Complimenatry coffee and tea, and internet service in the business center an added bonus.  Rooms are clean, and in ""the towers"" include a small balcony.  Service from staff generally very good.  Sense of opulence and history associated with the hotel is the major bonus.  Multiple restaurants and shops within the hotel a special feature, and convenience.  Some things however, are underwhelming.  The lobby is lacking in splendor, ceilings are low, and the general air far from grand.  Front desk staff, while basically kind and courteous, did not exude any sort of a ""wow"" factor in"
We were upgraded from the Tower and thankful for it. The pool is beautiful and peaceful. Service throughout the hotel and restaurants. We also ate at the highly rated Wasabi restaurant which was good but very expensive by Indian standards for what we ate. Many other good choices outside the hotel.
I dont think it gets better than this in terms of service and quality - have stayed her a few times on business and loved it - the rooms are spacious and immaculate - if you are in the old wing you have a butler service and the restaurants have great food too. The staff are amazing and I would highly recommend any stay here - I have only ever stayed in the Palace wing and woudl always recommend that.
"My wife & I have stayed in some pretty impressive hotels around the world, this is really special. The rooms in the Palace Wing are what you dream of. The staff are so attentive, nothing is too much trouble. We sample 3 restaurants, all fabulous, with the Indian just about taking the biscuit. Very special hotel and well situated for exploring the delights of Mumbai"
"After a long and very tiresome train journey! When we arrived at the Taj we were gracefully welcomed as if we were old friends. Every staff member treated us as royalty although we were dusty, dirty and travel hardened. We are very much looking forward to our anniversary dinner at Souk this evening! We only wish we could afford to stay more than one night. Anyone who comes to India must stay at least a night here, the perfect end to our trip!  Truly excellent!!!! "
"What can I say that has not already been said, I stayed for 4 nights and the total experience was brilliant. I got upgraded on arrival from the tower to a suite in the original building. All the staff were attentive and the breakfasts as you would expect were very good. My only complaint is you are charged for wifi, I stayed in 6 hotels in a 3 week visit to India from Delhi to Mumbai and this was the only hotel where wifi was not free. That is why I have marked only 4 for value."
"While this hotel property seems to be a bit more expensive if you are on your first trip to Mumbai ( or Bombay as everyone there calls it), you would be well served to experience this very special hotel. While they offer a Tower building , you will really experience ""old India service and atmosphere"" by booking a room in the legacy part of the hotel.  The service and personal attention is always at the highest level. I stayed on their ""club level"" and enjoyed every minute.  This hotel unfortunately experienced a terror attack a few years ago and the result is very high security even as your car pulls into the driveway. The security level is not over bearing and even quite subtle but you get the comfortable feeling that you are in a very protected property.  The onsite shopping"
We visited the hotel for afternoon tea with our young sons. The hotel building is stunning. The food was very good (but we generally stay away from eating fresh fruits and unbottled water even at very good restaurants). The staff were polite and professional. The view from the restaurant over the Gateway to India and all the ferries and people was a lot of fun. Definitely recommend a visit.
"This hotel is 5* throughout, from check in to check out.  The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and is in a prime location in Mumbai, close to tourist sites and overlooking the sea.  The service was top notch and we felt really welcome.  As our first hotel India the Taj felt special and really delivered, even giving us a complimentary upgrade. The breakfast in the Ocean Lounge was great as well, and the perfect start to the day. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in and the first Taj hotel I have ever tried."
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace at Xmas and had a wonderful stay.  Our room was in the original building and fabulous. The hotel is magical, facilities amazing, including the gym and pool, go on the hotel tour to hear the history of the building. The Indian restaurant was the best Indian food we've ever had although very pricey by Indian standards.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. We also stayed at the Oberio which is the number 1 hotel in Mumbai, but we felt that the Taj was number 1."
"We got to The Taj palace around 6pm last sunday and it was a beauty from the out side.. We entered from the Tower entrance witch the lobby was nice but not special.. At reception a guest relation executive Gunjanpreet Sehdeva took us to the executive lounge in the Palace end for checki-in and offered us a upgrade..   The key in elevator system and a short walk to our Room and what a room it was very nice with marble bathroom. We had dinner at Souk on the top floor of the tower end with a view of the majestic Gateway of India. Breakfast in Sea Lounge next morning was great everything you like for breakfast even bacon...     We were there for only one night so we did not try the spa or had a chance to try a few of the other restaurants, or pool area, but over all it was great  and"
"This time I was again treated to an upgrade to the Palace wing. Though this was a hectic work trip, my stay left me feeling rejuvenated, thanks to all the personal, warm attention showered on me. The most ""delightful"" moment of this visit was the set of facial scrubs and facial gels waiting for me when I was back after a long day at work. Thanks for a royal experience once again :)"

"We had lovelly rooms in the old Palace! The pool area is a fantastic and a quiet escape from noisy Mumbai. Restaurants, shops, the Gateway of India and museums are in walking distance. We are already looking foward to our next stay!!!"
We had booked a room at the Taj Mahal palace and then upgraded to the luxury suit the room was fabulous and the service was mind blowing. It was for my son's birthday. They had decorated the rooms with balloons and was sent a cake. Everything was perfect. Royalty at its best. We were treated like kings. One more reason make Taj group my favourite hotels across the world. 
"A stay at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in South Mumbai is an experience to be cherished. If you get to stay in the heritage wing of the hotel, your experience will be further enhanced. The rooms are extremely well done up with all amenities which befit a 5 star property. The service is prompt and the staff is ever smiling and willing to help.  the in house restaurants dish out some great food. However, you would also want to venture out and try the fantastic restaurants that are withing walking distance in south mumbai. Would love to go back."
"You cannot help but be in awe as you approach this magnificent building aside the Arabian Sea in Mumbai - with the hustle and bustle of the street life before you, you gaze down from your room comforted in splendour.   The Staff, ambiance and rooms ooze quality and you are left feeling pampered and cleansed.  We stayed on the club level (level 6) in the Palace wing, greeted with designer shops and sparkle along the walkways, and complimentary butler, high tea and canapés with cocktails, totally spoiled (disappointingly wi fi still chargeable though ...?). Breakfast included an abundance of choice, fresh and welcoming - we chose the buffet sea view restaurant with cosy opulent seating and a calming atmosphere ..... wonderful.  The pool looked lovely though evidently not enough"
"Let me begin to say that great services mean a lot to me. The service and attention in this hotel was not amazing. Being one of the most expensive hotel in the area, I expected no less than great.  They were responsible for my almost heart attack. I walked into my room and all my stuff was GONE. Come to find out they decided to move all my stuff to a different room without informing me. They claim i complained about my Queen size room and requested a King size room. No such thing happened from my end. Then the room they switch me too was not nearly as night as the first room. All I received from them was an apology. They did not offer any time of compensation for this horrible mistake. As far as the sea and Gateway to India view from the room was amazing. The hotel at a great"
"I had an opportunity to stay in this  great place last week. I was booked in Tower Wing but upgraded to Heritage block. The check-in was smooth. A lady from reception desk  accompanied me to my room on 4th floor and explained the facilities. The room was spacious with  marble flooring and the bath room with tub was nice.But I failed to understand as to why when they charge so much for the facility, there was no brushing/shaving kit in the room.Of course on demand they delivered  them promptly.I felt, these should be part on the standard toileteries  in the room. I had lunch in Masala kraft, the Indian  restaurant. food was delicious and service prompt. I had drinks in their  Harbour bar and the bartender explained me in detail about the cocktail he was going to serve. Next"
"We visited india for 2 weeks in February and this hotel was the highlight of all we stayed in. The hotel itself is beautiful & v v clean. We had a room in the older building with a view over the water from where we could see the gateway to india monument & light display every evening. The room was spotless and majestic, decked in white marble - one of the nicest we'd ever seen.  The swimming pool area is relatively small however the atmosphere was quiet & relaxing & felt private. You can eat there, the sandwiches are not fantastic but for india not a disaster. There are 6 or so restaurants to choose from. We tried the gourmet - the zodiac grill which was very good, the indian restaurant which was great & the pizza in Aquarius.  For india the pizza wasn't bad. The prices were"

"I came here for my birthday weekend and stayed in a club room in the main part of the hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful, but is the service that you will appreciate. The staff went above and beyond my expectations. The butler assigned to my room was excellent and the little surprises he left in the room throughout the weekend (including a delicious birthday cake) made me feel like I was the most important guest at the hotel. Viren D'Sa, the experiences manager, seemed like my best friend towards the end of my stay. You MUST take the hotel tour with him as the guide. He is extremely knowledgeable about the property and I have no doubt he will end up as some kind of television personality soon enough. Staying at the Taj Mahal Palace was one of the best hotel experiences I've"

It's like living in a museum with a great pool and some good dining options the rooms a really nice and very clean we stayed in the palace wing witch i think is better than the tower we had a see view room that was big and cosy with a nice big bathroom the hotel staff are really good and efficient good breakfast with a large buffet it was a nice stay !
"Everything about this hotel exudes quality. The history, building and staff are superb. I recommend that you take the 5pm introduction tour as there are some aspects you may miss. One example is that the lovely Sea View restaurant also serves breakfast overlooking the harbour.   Booked through TripAdvisor at a good price.  We totally recomend the Taj at Colaba"
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai after a Seabourn cruise, so we had been pretty spoilt and had high expectations.  The hotel staff are the most pleasant and accomodating you could ask for. We stayed in a Club Room, and the Reception process was smooth, efficient and comforting with  a drink and spot in the very luxurious lounge. Our room was beautiful with a view over the Gates of India, the bathroom, all  marble and beutifully finished.  The pool was a great relaxation after hectic Mumbai and the Pool Attendant was efficient and friendly.  We tried Marsala Craft and the Golden Dragon, great food and service. The personal butker and housekkeping were spectacular and efficient, even the driver to the airport was as delightful as he was efficient.   A truly world class"
"Fabulous hotel. Great service. Great facilities. Really enjoyed the pool which is up to 9'9"" deep, and the regular pool guy was really efficient and on the ball. Breakfast staff and food choice and quality very good. Room was really nice with a sea view. Had a problem with air-con in room not adjusting at first which was instantly reprogrammed and fixed. All restaurants we tried in hotel were nice. Niggles were addressed to complete satisfaction. Complimentary soft drinks, tea etc in palace lounge for palace side guests was a nice touch. Very busy bustling hotel but didnt have any trouble finding a spot to relax."
"Everything about this hotel is special. We were greeted with garlands and smiles. Staying in the newer block our room had a fantastic view of the Gateway to India and the sea. The room although not large was spacious enough for a short stay and extremely comfortable, including the kingsize bed. Dinner in the Indian restaurant Masala Kraft was a treat. The location was fantastic but unfortunately we arrived at a time when they were having some sort of Holi ceremony at the Gateway so could not get right up close, however the staff told us we would be given free tickets if we wished to view the entertainment. We didn't take advantage of this, but were not bothered by the noise either. The internet at the hotel is not free but I was very courteously given a free half hour which was"
Amazing place with amazing breakfast.  The old wing building is amazing and swimming pool are perfect. In the center like a perl.       If you have the money for that and you meet there all milliners arabs with their wife's black cover 
"spent the last three nights of our Indian odyssey at this fantastic hotel, being pampered with afternoon teas and cocktails,ambience of this hotel is unbelievable the staff are very very courteous and helpful this was our third stay and everything was as perfect as our first thank you the palace"
Location of this hotel is excellent. Got a room from where Gateway of India is in the front. The same view could not be enjoyed as balcony glass door is closed permanently and there is iron fence after the same. Rooms are small. Rooms give old look. Elevator does not have access control- anybody can reach anywhere. Staff is very good and breakfast excellent.
Superb location and area. Spa was brilliant as was the poolside and building! The evening meeting of crows at poolside was funny! And a lot of pigeons around. If you have a bird phobia poolside might not be for you. All staff poolside and in hotel are great. Free water at poolside is a fabulous idea. Pity the internet isn't free as well. 
"We decided on the Taj rather than the Oberoi as we wanted old school glamour, and this hotel had it in spades.  We had an executive room with sea view which was amazing, out butler looked after us the entire time, we had little presents and treats left out for us, and free tickets to a concert!! The staff could not do enough for you, any time of the day or night.  We were welcomed in a friendly and lovely way, whisked through check in at our own dedicated desk, and offered check out in our room.  The hotel is stunning, drinks are expensive but then it is normal London prices, quite a shock if you aren't used to them.  But step outside and eat and drink and you cant go wrong.  We went to the Oberoi for brunch and it was a nice hotel, and great food and staff but even after the"
"My partner and I are the life-time gold SPG members, so we could stay at any SPG luxury collection hotel in Mumbai, but I insisted on staying at Taj Mahal Palace and we loved it. It was perhaps the best experience we had in India. The property is amazing, the rooms are stunning, the service is impeccable, the restaurants are on par with some of the Michelin starred restaurants in NYC. I even went further and scheduled an appointment with an astrologer and as a non-believer, I left our session impressed.  The hotel is centrally located next to Gateway to India, so you can visit pretty much all the places by walk (or short taxi ride). It consists of the Palace and the Tower sections.  Before the arrival, we requested a Palace room and were graciously granted one. As a perk,"
"The is is one hotel where I would be tempted to spend my last penny.... Luxurious comfort, attentive and smiling staff who take care of your every need, clean and well kept rooms... what more can you ask for? But they still manage to give you that much more each time to make every trip memorable. Their staff is absolutely wonderful."
"Great rooms, excellent staff who were eager to help, immaculate. Excellent restaurants. Great view of the Gateway of India, very good security measures. We travelled as a group of 6 with my four teenage kids. We all enjoyed the hotel and service. Lovely pool and lounge area."
"Hello, Taj Mahal Palace is surely a landmark in Mumbai and it has excellent reviews. Though it is rated five stars, its services and standards do not compare to other five stars hotels I stayed at. Below is a detailed review of my stay:  Before arrival: We had our booking done on booking.com, we had specific requirements and we were contacted by at least four different people from the same email, checking with us on our stay. And they said contradicting stuff. At some point our booking got really mixed up that I had to call booking.com just before one day from traveling to sort the details out.   Airport pickup: We had ordered a pick up, and they were nice and sent us a jaguar.   Upon arrival: A lady was waiting for us and escorted us to our room, though it is a nice idea; the"
"The history of Mumbai and The Taj Mahal Palace are dramatically intertwined. The hotel is Mumbai’s first harbour landmark (built 21 years before the Gateway of India) and the site of the first licensed bar in the city. For more than a century, the Taj has played an intrinsic part in the life of the city, hosting Maharajas, dignitaries and eminent personalities from across the globe. Today it is a Leading Hotel of the World and favourite destination for discerning business travellers."
"This is my 1st review, ever. I always said it would take an amazing hotel experience for me to write my 1st review. Let me tell you,  taj mahal is that experience.taj mahal exceeded every exception and quite possibly has the most amazing, polite, sweet, endearing staff I have ever encountered.The breakfast was great, loads of options, all very fresh and excellent quality.lounge bar was great although quite pricey for Indian standards.The location is great too. I would recommend the hotel to anyone coming to Chennai."
"We stayed here for 2 nights before moving on to The Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur so we only ate in 2 of the restaurants. Wasabi is an absolute must and is a world class restaurant and we had high hopes for the Indian Restaurant but were rather disappointed; not by the food, which was delicious but by the decor and ambiance which was more like an office restaurant. We would have liked to try the Lebanese restaurant but couldn't get a booking so book this one in advance if you want to go there. Definitely do the 5pm tour of the hotel as the history etc is very interesting. We booked a Palace Club Room and were upgraded to The Bella Vista Suite (room 641), which was just amazing and we are grateful to the hotel for this.  The Palace wing is just beautiful and it is definitely worth"
We just had a coffee and snacks fold was not good but the place was good :D recommended just dont buy there cookies or tea expensive and they are not at all tasty better buy normal cookies from grocery store. All you pay is for there staff and that incredible build hotel recommended 
"The Taj Mahal Palace is an iconic hotel. Rooms, location and service are uniformly excellent. The pool is large, comfortable and a great refuge from the hot and crowded city. Breakfast in the Sea Lounge is sumptuous and absolutely delicious; seating is elegant on cushioned couches or cozy nook tables with sea views.  But to me, what really made our stay unforgettable, was the outstanding service of the concierge desk and in particular Satish Gaikwad, the head concierge (I believe). He not only helped with every restaurant recommendation and reservation, but he procured, seemingly out of thin air, complimentary VIP tickets to a fabulous concert in front of the Gateway to India and information on a heritage walk which we greatly enjoyed at the Elephanta Island Festival that"
"Awesome facility with good services. Recommend to everyother person who wants to see Mumbai or planning to visit it.we enjoy very much,staff were very good politehile the hotel is good and well located, the staff can be a bit more polite"
"Over the past 2 years , I have stayed here 3-4 times and it truly has been wonderful. Their service is excellent , the staff always greets you well and asks you how your day has been. Though far from the suburbs , it was a very convenient location for me as all my meetings were 5 minutes away from the Taj or at the Taj itself. If stepping out , It's extremely easy to get a cab from outside the hotel aswell and concierge is ever so kind to help you out with the same.  I have stayed in both the Palace wing and the Tower wing , I personally enjoyed the palace wing , its beautiful! As I was on a business trip I utilized all restaurants and room service at the hotel , the food is truly impeccable and the room service is very prompt aswell.  As a tourist this is a great location ,"
"Fab room and bathroom, spacious, well decorated, elegant, great sea view. Excellent service and delicious breakfast in  garden. Very good facilities, great public spaces, grand. Would not hesitate to return"
"Stayed in a palace room for 2 nights and the service was excellent from start to finish. Good location for the causeway for shopping and eating ( try Leopolds it's excellent), good swimming pool (although could do with a few more sun beds), lovely breakfast in the Sea Lounge and a superb room. Would recommend to everyone to stay here. After an interlude we are off to the Taj Fort in Goa to celebrate our anniversary lets hope Taj Fort is as good as Taj Mahal Palace - it has a lot to live up to!!"
We only stayed for two nights but our time there was very enjoyable. Our room was on the top floor of the palace building and Taj club status so it was excellent and with good sea views. Although the Tak Club lounge was exceptionally well furnished and very stylish we found it a bit too quiet so used the main restaurants and bars instead. All the restaurants we tried were excellent although unlike the rest of the hotel we considered the bars lacking in style and atmosphere. The hotel is suitable for waliking to local shope and restaurants.
"Pros: It had everything we wanted in both the room and the public spaces Cons: nothing Location: It is a tourist site itself and next to the Gateway of India monument. Street stalls are around the corner. Other tourist sites are walking distance. This is probably one of the most complete hotel experiences we have ever had. The hotel had all facilities, including an excellent pool. It is located bang in the middle of downtown Mumbai and is in walking distance of a range of tourist sites, although you could comfortably spend all day in the hotel surrounds. The staff could not have been more helpful and prompt. Although it is expensive,you get value for money, especially with the discount available through Expedia."
"We stayed at this historical place during March 2014, great ambience of a bygone era with modern amenities, marble top tables and closets with antique doors - a unique experience.  Hospitality is great, from the moment we got off the arrival lounge until we reached the airport on our return journey it was a very pleasant experience, very attentive people - we had a wonderful time here. Many restaurants within the hotel, large pool, good facilities at the Gym.  We had breakfast by the pool side and it was great to see pigeons fly around the building around the pool. Will visit again if I get a chance."
Loved the ambience and stay.. Could see gateway decorated like a bride from my room. The rooms are big so is the bathroom. Loved my stay .. It's an expensive property but then you feel like royalty . Recommend to everyone who wants to see Bombay from a different perspective
"This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in. 1. The breakfast was amazing and it is changed daily. The waiter read your mind I thought about coffee and they asked is I wanted more coffee, I wanted more toast and they ask if I want more toast. 2. travel desk: Best In the world. I had to reserve a flight to Delhi and the guy in travel desk got me the flight 3,000 Rupee cheaper than the internet and when I was on the plane they called me by name and gave me a free meal, I was told that this was because of hotel. 3.The ambiance and architecture are amazing. 4. i was using th ebusiness center for a long time and got hungry a while later the man in charge took a Menu to me just in case I was hungry.  Again service here is unbelievable . This hotel is really worth the extra effort"
"What truly makes this property worth the price is the exceptional service.  I would definitely recommend a stay in the older wing and upgrading to the club floors which include both breakfast and cocktails.  The sea view room is interesting to watch the water activity, ferries, yacht racing and the crowds that come to view the Gateway to India.  The spa services were reasonably priced and the restaurants offered a wonderful variety of cuisines.  The pricing is as expected for a ""luxury"" hotel and while one would expect WiFi to be included and to work seamlessly, one needs to remember that India is still a developing country in many ways."
"We stayed here for a night on our way back home to London. What an amazing experience. This is a truly historical hotel. Our room was sea facing with great view of Gateway to India monument.   Restaurants were fantastic, and I would recommend Historical tour to this hotel that takes place every day. "
"We stayed at the Harbour Suite in the Heritage Wing. This was our first time staying in the Heritage Wing (instead of the Tower Wing) and it's definitely worth the difference in price! Check-in is done in the heritage wing itself and the feel and charm of this section of the hotel is infinitely more old world classy. It is much nicer than in the main lobby of the hotel.   On entering the suite, the first thing one notices is the size! There is a passage which leads to a large sitting area where you can entertain guests / have your meals, etc.  The bedroom is spacious and comfy. We were celebrating an occasion, so the hotel staff had decorated the bedroom with balloons, which shows the attention to detail the Taj always takes. The bed was large and extremely comfortable with tons"
"Great ambiance of the hotel, situated right next to the beautiful gateway. The food is great. Gyms are well equipped. Pool side breakfast / dinner is really refreshing. Quite close to many other attractions as well."
"this hotel is my best hotel in whole Maharashtra,it has a good rooms and good beds,good  services,from this hotel when we see outside,it looks beautiful foods are tasty and Delicious.we enjoy very much,staff were very good polite"
"We were visiting India to take a luxury train journey from Mumbai to Delhi and decided to spoil ourselves with a stay at The Taj Mahal Palace.  We booked a Club Room in the heritage wing which overlooked the Gateway to India. The 5 day stay was perfect, we were well looked after by our room staff and by the staff in the club lounge, particularly Ravinder. Every member of staff we encountered made sure that our stay was enjoyable and memorable. We used the hotel car service and a registered guide for a half day tour of Mumbai and the same guide for a trip to Elephanta Island, both were good value. Our room was not huge but large enough and was perfectly equipped, even had a TV screen embedded into the bathroom mirror. We had a really comfortable stay, slept well from day 1. A"
"We stayed 2 nights at the end of our 2 week holiday touring around India and Goa, and on check-in we were delighted to be upgraded to a Club room. This is a fabulous hotel in a great location opposite the Gateway to India and within easy walking distance of some of the main tourist sites. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  The only negative is that we felt that some of the staff working on the ground floor (reception and breakfast restaurant) were lacking in courtesy. One morning we were searching for a free table to have breakfast and were completely ignored by the staff, and when I approached a member of staff he just said that all the tables were full just now. We didn't want to eat in the main dining room as it is very noisy and chaotic and ended up finding a table in the"
"We stayed for our anniversary at 'The Taj Mahal Palace' and booked a room in the heritage wing and it was quite huge with all the modern amenities. I must compliment Tata group and management team of Taj, who have refurbished this historic property after the unfortunate incident couple of years back. View of Gateway of India and beach is inviting from the room. Food is good at the restaurant but repetitive during our stay. The tower wing is not that inviting, as I have been their for business conferences. Staff service is excellent."
"I am a frequent visitor to India, but had not stayed at the Taj Palace in Mumbai until our last trip.  We specifically started our holiday in Mumbai so we could spend our first 5 nights in the hotel.  We stayed in a club room overlooking India Gateway in the Palace Wing.  The rooms were okay, but did not reflect the luxury of the communal areas.  Breakfast was served in a separate dining area on the 1st floor and was overcrowded with uninspiring food. Service was average. The club lounge located on the ground floor gives access for afternoon tea and evening cocktails. It's a nice place to wind down after a day's sightseeing.  Unfortunately, the hotel was clearly uncomfortable with same sex couples. The 'butler' who was assigned to our room was clearly homophobic.  All in all, I"
"The hotel itself and common areas are beautiful. The room we were in was just ok, a little worn. Air conditioning vent didn't distribute air to whole room, so it was very stuffy by the bed, resulting in some sleepless nights. Great view of gateway to India, but not worth the room's disadvantages. Not a really nice room, just ok. I'd say stay elsewhere (maybe Vivanta by Taj President) and just stop by here to check it out and have a drink."
"This hotel cannot be faulted in terms of service, ambience or facilities. Food is excellent. Rooms well equipped and frequently services. The spa is lovely and the pool is a bonus for a city-centre hotel. I was sorry to leave!"
"I stayed for 4 nights in early March 2014. It was generally very good but not exceptional. The dining area felt cramp and congested. Rooms were well maintained. Poolside was beautiful. Staff were attentive and polite. The security screening was very thorough and made one feel safe but not invasive. I hired the hotel transport for a 2hr tour round delhi, it was superb especially in the morning at 8am when there is not much traffic. Highly recommended"
"After touring the Golden Triangle, we were fortunate to be able to spend a couple of days at this wonderful hotel. From the minute we arrived we felt that everyone really cared about our stay here. The staff were courteous and very helpful, we were able to get interconnecting rooms so it enhanced our family experience. The concierge were most helpful in making sure we got the most out of our stay here from recommending a nice trip down to Nariman Point to experience some exotic ice cream at Natures - even arranging a drive down to there in the hotel vehicle. The evening meal was also a wonderful experience as was the breakfast. There was even a chance to relax poolside before our transport arrived.  This is a must stay location if in Mumbai!"
A landmark hotel right across the Gateaway of India. A must stay place while visiting Bombay. Staff is extraordinary. Restaurants and service are first class. I highly recommend staying in the Palace as it is worth the extra money.
"I was in the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel for 4 nights. Everything was perfect until the second night that a nearby hotel ( across the street ) had a party ( wedding ) and we had to move to another room because the hotel do not have sound proof windows and the sound was inside our room. The maneger was perfect and moved us right away but is always an incovinient. The location of the hotel is perfect if you want to go to elephanta island and lots of shopps to buy gifts. If I knew better, although I like the experience, I would stay at the Oberoy hotel. But I need to say that the food, employees and all the staff there were very nice."
"Booked to celebrate my wife's birthday. But was sorely disappointed - 1. I drove down and asked bell boy to bring the luggage. He with disbelief asked, ""you have a reservation"" yes. ""u wud be staying here"" yes  2. while checking in was curtly told ""we dont accept pan card"". However, went ahead since i refused to provide anything else. They had my credit card details but asked CC again and infact charged even more than the room rate during my stay. Very insulting. Almost as if they dont trust that my card would work at check out. 3. Lady who escorted us had no idea whose birthday it was and when, upon seeing ballons asked whether it was my son's birthday. 4. Room size was pretty average. 5. View of gateway was superb.  6. Balcony had too much dust on the window frames and steel"
"Well, what can I say, what a disappointment. Returning here after 20 years and remembering the Taj as it was then is a great handicap, maybe if I hadn't known it then it would have...but no, afraid not - even by today's standards its just not very 5* anymore.  *No fruit or complimentary tidbits at all on arrival - even cheap hotels give you a few biscuits and this makes you feel you are not important to them at all  *The breakfast is terrible in terms of variety and quality, I've had better of both in 3 star hotels in Europe, and I promise I am not being difficult I really have * The food standard was ok but not what it used to be and the portions ridiculous I had a seafood and scallop soup which was fish stock with cream and ONE king prawn and ONE scallop - thank god I ordered"
Out of this world staff were amazing we got a free upgrade the room view was great.I was in India for 3weeks and ordered room service the food was amazing the best curry I had the hole time in india.I found no fault with the hotel and truly amazing experience   ( young traveller still treated me great )
"I stayed here twice during my latest trip to India.  I had a Palace Room on both occasions and used the Club Room facilities.  Beautiful hotel, with history and style.  In my opinion this is the very best hotel I have ever stayed in India, and I have been to quite a few different palaces in various areas.  I gave the travel desk a difficult problem, and they were more than up to the job and solved the issue in a timely manner.  The Concierge service was also enormously helpful and efficient.  I recommend this hotel without reservation."
"I initially booked a room through my corporate booking portal in Taj President and when I checked into the Hotel, I've been upgraded to the Taj Mahal Palace as I think the rooms are full or they wanted to do it for few customers based on some logic. But the way its been done has to be commended. Initially when I entered the hotel, I had an injury in my finger and it was bleeding. I think something cut my finger when I was getting out of the Taxi Cab which I didn't realise. The front office staff (I forgot to note down the names) were quick enough to address it and gave me some band-aids for temporary relief. I was really impressed. Added to it a staff personally accompanied me in a car from this hotel to the upgraded hotel and was there till the check in formalities were"
"I stayed here for seven nights with my family, my room was huge.the service sas outstanding, staff extremely polite.concierge were so helpful and assisted me with the best locations for shopping. The lobby has a wonderful ambience and beautiful decor. The pool area is fantastic. A truly amazing experience.... Unforgettable."
"Taj Mahal Palace is such an iconic landmark thanks to its proximity to Gateway of India and the historical context. I have stayed here a few times in the palace rooms. Everything about this place is so carefully put together, from the infrastructure to the service, that no hotel can match it. It is without a doubt my favourite hotel to work from in India."
"We booked for two nights in a sea view Palace room, but were upgraded to a 'club' room on the 5th floor. This gave us access to the lounge on the ground floor which offered plenty of treats and indulgences including afternoon high tea, cocktail hour and at 21.30 'cognac and chocolates'!  The room had a stunning view across to the Gateway of India and was as well appointed as you would expect.  As it was my birthday they had decked out the room with balloons, petals, a Happy Birthday pillow and even a delicious birthday cake.  Service was exceptional wherever we went in the hotel.  We ate in the main international restaurant and the Chinese Golden Dragon.  We had breakfast in the sea room which overlooks the Gateway and the following day on the terrace outside near the pool.  In"
At TAJ you can see the meaning of hospitality. They make you feel you are special or some VIP. You get an experience of lifetime memories at The TAJ.  Excellent food quality and various  cuisine options. One must stay in TAJ at least once in their lifetime
Our room was opposite the Gateway to India. This was lit up at night so was very pretty to watch.  The room itself was very nice and comfortable. The staff were very nice and helpful. The pool restaurant was very good with excellent food. Although you are in a very noisy area the rooms were quiet. Would recommend this hotel for your stay in Mumbai.
"Awesome place to stay in... Services are exceptionally well, at the same time you get that heritage feeling of being in The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai: Proud of INDIA Please visit the place at least once in your life. Its worth every penny."
Our Rajistan adventure came to an end at the Taj in Mumbai. I had heard you must stay in the Palace part and that we did. The staff the service the perks the room( they had upgraded us to a Junior Suite ) were perfect.. the breakfast was extraordinary .
"i had a great room even though not sea facing but its truly a luxury hotel and value for money. One must experience it to rate it.... I would recommend don't look at your budget.. indulge...  it was awesome stay - the staff are just exceptional - professional, smart, obliging and great willingness with every attention to detail... Great work"
"Taj Mahal Palace ( heritage wing) - it was awesome  - the staff are professional, smart, obliging and great willingness with every attention to detail - the atmosphere and location of the palace wing is unbeatable.housekeeping  all so great."
It is one of the best sea facing hotel in the city of mumbai.. the sea view room gives a real refeshing stay.. the hotel has amazing high end stores for shopping.. the staff is very couteous and polite.. it is one of the best taj property
"Booked a Deluxe City view room at Taj Mahal Palace Hotel for single night on occasion of our wedding anniversary. On arrival at the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised when our room was upgraded free of charge to a Luxury room in the Palace wing. Unlike the tower wing rooms, this room was large and was laced with white marble. The room made us feel special and to add to it was the exceptional hospitality and attention to details of the staff. Every member of the staff we met in the hotel was courteous and greeted us with a smile. Within 2 hours of our arrival, a complimentary chocolate cake was sent to our room. For Dinner, we chose to dine at Masala Kraft - The Indian Restaurant in the hotel. Although a tad over priced, the food was really worth it. Upon return to our room in"
"I cannot speak for tower rooms as I have not seen them but the atmosphere and location of the palace wing is unbeatable. I stayed at one of the palace wing rooms and I was blown away with the service offered at this chain hotel.  Concierge, housekeeping and the breakfast service were all so great that I am finding it hard to describe. The attention to detail and lovingly offered service was even better than you'd expect from the best small/boutique hotel.  Any visit to Mumbai would be incomplete without staying at this place.  PS. The Spa needs immediate renovation"
"As a returning guest to the Taj Mahal Palace ( heritage wing) - it was another awesome stay - the staff are just exceptional - professional, smart, obliging and great willingness with every attention to detail - we stayed in the Taj Club room - fantastic - the butler service is mindlblowing - second to none!!!!!. The Palace Lounge is perfect after a day out sightseeing and shopping. Just love the pool area - the swing is my favourite as you can just sit there and chill. My mum thoroughly enjoyed the historical tour of the hotel. Viren D'sa shows true passion for his job when he does the tour.The entire ambiance of the hotel is such bliss. Love the high tea at the Palace lounge together with drinks and chocolate hour ( very stylish)There is unlimited internet use for an hour at a"
"This was my second longish stay (about a week) at the Taj and while it's a beautiful property with stunning views and a great location, I was less charmed than last time for a few reasons.  Except for the view (Gateway of India from our window), the rooms in the Tower are nothing to write home about compared with other Indian hotels in this class.  We found the food to be mediocre and in the all-day poolside restaurant, Aquarius, seriously overpriced.  Of course one expects to pay a premium for food at a 5-star hotel on such a property, but there is a tipping point beyond which one starts to feel mistreated.  Almost $20 for a small vegetable burger (with no accompaniments) crossed that point for me.  Service at Aquarius was also a problem; a few of the waiters are clearly pros"
The hotel is everything we expected of a Taj hotel. The food and service were exceptional and the staff attentive and friendly. We were upgraded to a magnificent room overlooking India Gate in the old section which we feel sure is better than the newer Tower section. The pool is a beautiful place for a pre-dinner G&T and the Souk restaurant on the 19th floor in the Tower section served a truly memorable meal. Our only regret is that we only had one night here before catching our flight home.
The TAJ Mahal Palace & Towers Mumbai is truly a masterpiece in every aspect. Right from the time your car enters the property till the time you are escorted to your room the experience is fantastic. Check - In: Lightning Fast Service: Excellent is the least i can describe Rooms: Large & Cosy I was celebrating our new marriage in this hotel. Since it was our honeymoon the hotel decorated our rooms and did arrange a complimentary cake. My wife being Jain was not able to eat this one as it contained egg but the service staff (Himanshu) did went out of the way and came back with an eggless one which really made our day.  I would also like to thank Ms.Gunjan for educating & highlighting us on the history of TAJ during our heritage tour. Her knowledge and enthusiasm and pride of being
"I have traveled all over the world and stayed at the finest hotels in each city. Nothing compares to what I just had at the Taj Mahal Palace.  There's an extraordinary sense of history that surrounds the building. It's ideally located for access to all of the sites.   You step in and it's stepping into another time, one more genteel. The city itself is beautiful and brutal, but the Taj offers an amazing escape after a long day.  First piece of advice is to spring for the Palace rather than the Tower rooms. I was immediately upgraded to the most magnificent suite with a view of the Fate Of India and the Arabian Sea.  The staff is phenomenal, so helpful, and by the second day, they treat you as if you're a regular.  The breakfast spread is sumptuous. Sitting on the veranda"
"Stayed at this hotel for business and it was very well located with good business services and WiFi, breakfast and pool (actually it is a great pool).  The service was first rate: with the most attentive and painless check-ins I have ever had; helpful concierge; prompt food and room service and easy check out.  The rooms were fine with good views, but like the rest of the hotel are just starting to show their age which for the balance of the hotel is fine but a progressive refresh of the rooms would be welcome.  I stayed in the new wing."
"One of the most magnificent hotels in the world, The Taj & it's management have remained resolute in their promise to treat their guests with the utmost courtesy. Rising like a phoenix from the tragedy of 2008, it has quickly restored itself to it's old glory. The salon, the pool, the lovely restaurants & the beautiful rooms (with superb bathrooms) are all enhanced by the attention to the details & excellent service. Even the tightest security measures are carried out with exceptional politeness & efficiency. Staying here is an experience of a lifetime & I've been fortunate enough to experience that more than once."
I arrived as one does at 2am and was quickly bundled into  a room and slept like a dream. The next morning I woke up to looking at the backside of Mumbai not a pretty site. I went down and chatted to the receptionist and for about an extra USD 25 I moved to room 806 and my world was transformed. It looked straight out onto the gates of India. The downside is if your have the doors open it is a lot more noisy. This did not bother me I liked looking out onto the hustle  and bustle. Noise free when one closes the door. The rooms service is nice and  efficient. Breakfast outside is a must don't sit inside go sit by the pool. However walking to fetch your food and back is a little walk well worth the effort as that area has oldy worldly charm. 
"This year I stayed three nights and was welcomed back like an old friend. Apart from the magnificent architecture, superb dining experiences and out of this world spa, the hotel staff make this a very special experience. All of the staff I encountered couldn't have been more helpful, professional and friendly, particularly the Historical Tour guide - nothing was too much trouble for them. They took pride in their hotel, noticed little things and anticipated needs and all went the extra yard for their guests. A particular incident stands out - I lost the lower portion of an earring - not an expensive earring but one of great sentimental value to me. After looking around my room and retracing my steps, I mentioned it to several staff members just in case someone turned it in and"
"We stayed three nights in the Palace Wing and had an excellent experience. The Taj Palace in Bombay is without a doubt, the grandest, most architecturally impressive and historic hotel I have ever stayed at. The hotel is immaculately maintained, has stunning interiors (in the palace wing) and has beautiful art displayed throughout.   The rooms and bathrooms are large, ultra-luxurious and very well furnished. The beds are extremely comfortable (and enormous). The décor in the rooms is very nice, striking the right balance between old world charm and modern luxury. We had a sea facing room with a view of the Gateway of India which was lovely. A very good (and extensive breakfast) was included.  Every amenity and service you could think of is available (albeit at a price). Service"
"It was the best holiday I had ever enjoyed. Sad to say the travel guides are a rip-off, they are not to be trusted, reason being, when requesting to visit the local peoples shopping centres, they tend to take you to the most expensive shops , so as a tourist you just get ripped-off. That was the sad part of my holiday, otherwise India is amazing the food , people are warm and friendly the staff at the hotel are helpful and inviting, I could go on , My Indian holiday was the best...... I am doing this holiday all over again, in the near future. Thank ""GOD"" for a country like India... the food, people and scenery."
"Me and my wife travelled to the Taj Hotel and palace in Mumbai we both agreed  it was a an amazing and different experience. We had the honeymoon package. The service was great. The food however was out of this world simply wonderful. We stayed for 2 nights. The view  we had was poolside and  was great. The big windows made the view even more spectacular. The room we were in had  a TV in the bathroom mirror, very nice feature. This is a pricey hotel. Overall I would recommend this hotel to everyone for anyone looking for a totally different experience.The Taj hotel and palace in Mumbai will make sure of that."
"Can't recommend this hotel enough, from the warm personal welcome to the signature cocktail made at our table at the Harbour bar, we thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our stay! Room service fantastic, nothing was too much trouble, pool attendant made us feel welcome in a a packed pool area  - he managed to find us two beds, put them together, provide clean towels and take our drinks order within 5 minutes! Masala restaurant was also fab, food amazing and the service was great. Just love this hotel, nice vibe in the lobby and the rooms are stunning, they have thought of everything! My husband especially liked the selection of glasses provided in the neat little pull out draws! All they need to change is the charge for WIFI and it would be perfect ;)"
"over the years the word taj has become a synonym with exquisite. the moment you enter the lobby itself you just cannot stop praising the beauty of the place. just yards away from the iconic gateway of india and located at the south of the most happening city, the hotel has a breathtaking view of the indian ocean. a friendly staff and excellent service definitely makes taj an icon. went there for a fine dining experience and the food was simply amazing. they surely have the best chefs from around the globe"
"we stayed here to celerate our marriage... we had a fun time... the staff is realy hospitable.. we had dining coupons, which gave us 20% discount. They also popped a a champagne for us to celebrate our marraige and gave us a complimentary cake... The breakfast however wasnt a great  spread... but all in all a good hotel :)"
"We have just returned from 3 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace which was an absolute perfect end to our honeymoon in India. The hotel is simply exquisite with a stunning lavish lobby and a perfect location just yards from the Gateway of India. Every member of staff was friendly, welcoming and helpful and seemed to welcome backpackers right through to VIPs equally.   At check in we were shown to our sea view room in the Tower wing which had been thoughtfully decorated with rose petals and balloons for our honeymoon. On returning to our room on the first evening we had also been give a delicious chocolate cake - a really lovely touch which added to our overall experience.   Breakfast in Shamiana restaurant was extensive and tasty with the same excellent service. The pool area was"
"the Taj Mahal Palace is much more than just hotel to  stayed at in India, it is a peace of history, full with art, a place to see and meet peaple from all over the world.other than that, spend some more and stay at the palace wing and not at the tower! The Taj is a luxurious and beautiful hotel. It has spectacular views of the sea and the India Gate or to their beautiful pool. The rooms are comfortable and complete with every amenity you could need. The bathrooms are large, luxurious, and complete with shower and tub."
"Although I have passed through Mumbai before, this was my first chance to stay at this Indian Institution and I was definitely not disappointed!  We had booked a Seaview deluxe room in the original Palace wing. We arrived at 0900 and although our room as not available, we were given a non sea view room until it was which allowed us to freshen up.  I can't tell you what the Sea view room was like because we were then upgraded to a magnificent suite overlooking the gateway to India! Thank you Taj!  Service is impeccable and friendly. And after it's extensive refurb, all parts of the hotel that I saw were exquisite.  OK so nothing is ever quite perfect. Breakfast is served in several locations but all were full with disgruntled customers moaning outside. But it is worth a wait to"
"This was the largest hotel that we stayed at in India and you do feel that you lose a bit of the charm of the other Taj hotels that we had visited because of that but it is in an excellent position with a wonderful view of the water, boats & the Gateway to India as well as walking easy access to shops & sightseeing.   The staff were charming but very busy and we stayed in the old wing which had pleasant rooms with a good view over the water.  I do agree with another reviewer that it would be a great help to have wifi in all rooms available free and not just in the club lounge.  The breakfast was good and we enjoyed our stay."
Beautiful scenic hotel that should'nt miss. Excellent for business stay. Easily accessable downtown.  Well maitained. Beautiful ocean view. Old wing is excellent choice than the new one. Nothing to complain.
The Taj is a luxurious and beautiful hotel.  It has spectacular views of the water and the India Gate.  The rooms are comfortable and complete with every amenity you could need.  The bathrooms are large and complete with shower and tub.  I traveled to Mumbai with three other women and all had spectacular rooms.  Our main mission was to shop and there is good shopping in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.  We hired a driver to take us several places not within walking distance of the hotel but the hotel was still convenient for our purposes.   The staff are well trained and very pleased to meet your every need.  Our rooms were in the old portion of the hotel which was extremely quiet and had a wonderful feel of colonial times. The architecture is just what you would expect from
V stayed for a week in taj. It was a very good experience and very welcoming receptionist.almost 3-4 times housekeeping will come n ask if v need anything.  Breakfast was amazingly amazing with sooo many varieties. The thing I didn't liked is wifi facility. They should be a free wifi at least in the room.
"Stayed here a couple of years ago and it was fabulous. Upgrade to a suite. It is a tranquil hotel in the middle of a noisy city.  The suite was kitted out with the most up to date electrics and beautiful furnishings. Lovely large bathroom and beds that you hated having to get up from. The pool area is wonderful, a little piece of tranquility.  The staff are amazing, very friendly and always looking out for you when you are out the front of the hotel to prevent you from being hassled.  This is the only hotel to stay in when visiting Mumbai."
"Recently stayed in the Palace Wing at the Taj and was absolutely blown away by the service and at how amazing this place was. Everything from the breakfast, to the pool, to the service in the bars was fantastic. The architecture and decoration is just beautiful and we didn't want to leave"
"This hotel is one of my favorite in the world; it has suffered much since the 2009 attack, the decision to restore it exactly as it was wishes to remind us that time (and people) pass, but the Taj Mahal is here to stay.. True story, but the magnificence of its external architecture, the grand swimming pool and luxurious pool are among the few things that make the hotel shine as it should. The rooms on the palace side are definitively better than the tower, the two can't be compared. If not for the beautiful view of the tower rooms on the seaside, you may even forget you're in a 5 Star L hotel.  I do believe this hotel is special and I hope they'll maintain as it deserves: one of the most magnificent hosting places in the world"
"What more can be said about this hotel? 100 plus years of grand illustrious history playing host to royalty, heads of state, and celebrities. As much a part of this magnificent city as the Gateway of India and Victoria Terminus (which are mere steps away) and on par with any of the heritage hotels of New York and London. If you have the funds, there is no other place in Mumbai you should be staying. Had a very smooth check-in after arriving at around 9 pm, and got an upgrade to the a Palace room (with its opulent entryway of staircases, cavernous and tastefully appointed hallways, and ridiculously high ceilings in the recently renovated rooms). Tip: Book through the hotel's website directly, they contain deals for inclusive breakfast/internet. In-house restaurants are also open"
"This is one of my hotel favourites. Taj combines luxury with a friendly, warm and personal service which does not seem artificial and really makes you feel at home. The building really gives a sense of history, the rooms are luxurious and the service perfect.   Pity that the redecoration of the Harbour Bar has taken away some of the atmosphere that was there previously. Also a hotel like this should not charge separately for wifi access, and it would be nice if they served food such as chips and sandwiches by the pool. But these are all just minor glitches, all in all a fantastic hotel."
Just about everything you could want in a hotel. They knew we were there on our honeymoon and to say they had made an effort to greet and make us feel special would be an understatement. Not only had they decorated the room but they even made us a beautiful chocolate cake that would gave easily cost 50 bucks elsewhere! The service throughout our five night stay was exceptional and the pool makes an excellent retreat from the Mumbai Madness. I can't go without mentioning breakfast which was by far the best buffet we had ever seen. Thanks to everyone at the Taj. We will be sad to leave tomorrow
"Stayed at the Lands End on my last trip to Mumbai and thought it couldn't get any better - well, I was wrong. The Taj Mahal Palace has cultured the same fine Taj experience I have become accustomed to but it is packaged in a stunning palace building that kept me mesmerized. I had the privilege to stay in a palace wing room and those rooms are beautifully appointed without taking away any of the charm.  I love the sea lounge were breakfast is served, the views are spectacular and the ambiance perfectly suits the grand old building.  Service as usual is impeccable - efficient, non-intrusive but always at hand. It's at a level of refinement that is very hard to find anywhere else. My office is closer to the Lands End but I am glad I had a chance to experience this grand old dame"
"Staying at the Taj was an unforgettable experience. We arrived at 2am to a lovely personalised check-in and staff who couldn't do enough for us. We had booked a town facing tower room and they upgraded us that night to a room facing the sea and the Gateway to India. As it was my partners birthday, they had decorated the room with balloons, flowers and served a lovely chocolate cake. All with the most warm and welcoming service. The next day, they upgraded us again to a palace room and to club lounge, which included afternoon tea with snacks, early evening cocktails with canapés and late evening cognacs with chocolate.  I'd highly recommend the Palace rooms over the Tower rooms, and would also recommend a view over the Gateway to India, which is particularly spectacular at"
This Hotel needs its own measuring stick. From the perfectly immaculate condition and upkeep of this inspired ICONIC PALACE. to the grace and poise of this remarkable and grateful staff make this hotel a bucket list destination. BRAVO I am a better person for having staying there.
I do a rez. Confirmed pending credit card. I send. No response. I ask. Hotel says person I sent info to is different person. send again. what? who's the different person? Send my credit card info to all of India? Something's very wrong here
"Staying at the Taj was a nice experience being part of this magnificent and historical building. The common areas area magical including the peaceful pool area. Service is of a 5 start hotel and staff were doing everything to make the stay pleasant. We had sea view room which immediately made a room with an amazing view facing the sea and the Gate of India. The only thing I wasn't too impressed by was the bathroom which was small and a little bit run down especially when compared to bathrooms of other 4 star hotels in Mumbai. Unfortunately the linen wasn't clean either, there were stains of blood and it was the same with the towels. I think that in a hotel like the taj you should be replacing linen and towels with new ones if not completely clean. We did complain and the staff"
A very comfortable stay in a perfect location in Mumbai. The staff are most helpful and accomodating - without being intrusive. The breakfasts were good especially the items cooked to order. The afternoon Palace tour was particualrly interesting and well worth the time.
"The only hotel in the country which gives you goosebumps when you think of staying is Taj, Mumbai. This hotel is rich in its Architecture and History. Whose who of the world lands here to be to experience the exquisite experience. My affair with Tajmahal palace is for the past nine years. I have attended and organised lot of conferences in every conference hall involving who’s who in mumbai. I have seen every inch of taj, the conference halls,the lobby,the dance floor,the restaurants,the staircase,the swimming pool, the luxury shops,the lobby,the banquets,the toilets,the barber shop,the kitchen,the rooms,the office space, the taj memory photo shop….i have gone around this terrific hotel so many times,not just the interiors, every thing here is a class apart ..!! "
This hotel was so PERFECT! The room was clean and exquisite! DIE FOR! The food was AMAZING. The location could not be even more perfect. No wonder this hotel is a part of the leading hotels in the world. I wish I could give this place SIX STARS!
"The Taj Mahal Palace place to be.. I appreciated this place because it is central, invigorating and dynamic. The big difference with other hotels is the staff: they are very welcoming and efficient here.  I remember a staff who kindly helped me on several occasions at the front desk & guests service.  Food was amazing in the hotel. Rooms were nice & clean well comfortable with all requirements."
"Have stayed there several times over the last 12 years. This hotel is unique, there is no other like it. It starts with the historic building (stay at the palace wing) which takes you to another time. The restaurant are all excellent, see my review on the Japanese one for example), the rooms are splendid. The staff attention to detail (e.g. you enter the breakfast room, they just ask you room number, on the way they use your name and wish you a good day looking forward to see you again) which separate this establishment from most of the best ones all over Asia. Every staff person you meet greets, is genuinely friendly and caring to make sure everything runs smooth. After a long business day, some time in the comfortable lounge chairs around the pool with a glass of white wine,"
"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, we found it a peaceful haven in a busy city, beautiful bathroom, vast choice of food within the hotel, breakfast overlooking Mumbal harbour and the choice was extensive."
"The Taja Mahal Palace is amazing. The staff is very attentive and helpful. The rooms are quite big and nice. We had one with a view of the Gateway, which was quite the treat! They have a really nice garden with a pool where one can wind down from the big city life. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Bombay!"
"As ever a fabulous place to stay.The main ares are sumptuous and the staff are attentive and efficient. I do think however that the bathrooms are a bit dated and could do with refreshing. Overall a brilliant place to stay ,excellent food and brilliant position"
"The staff are perfectly professional and helpful.  they cant do enough.  The location is walking distance to great restaurants and shopping and walking.  The rooms are updated, marble, seamless glass, balconies, and great views.  The hotel great rooms are majestic. The value is very good.  I originally booked us in a good boutique hotel near by but couldn't get the train tickets so changed to the Taj and let the travel desk get the train tickets.  Once we arrived and understood the area better, I was so pleased that we were not in the boutique hotel.  This is very Indian and elegant."
"We stayed here for four nights in the Palace wing with rooms overlooking the Gateway.  Beautiful room and the whole hotel is simply stunning, superb decor, flower arrangements and detail.  the staff were also first class.  In particular, mention must be made of Viren A. D'Sa whose  took guests on a tour of the hotel regailing stories of history and events that had taken place in the hotel.  He spoke several languages and had all the guests enthralled by his storytelling , acting and humour.  The food in the hotel (breakfast and snacks) was excellent.  However, in the evenings, we ventured out and ate at two recommended restaurants - Khyber and Indigo - both excellent  We certainly wouldn't hesitiate staying at this hotel if we should ever go back to Mumbai"
"The staff is amazingly helpf\ul and the place couldn't be better located... however I would recomment to skip having any meal in the restaurants, the food is not so good and it might be worth to try some other local places. :) ENJOY! th"
"We went to Taj Mahal Ptalace & Towers to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. We stayed in a deluxe room on the 18th Floor of the Tower wing. We have stayed previously at all the Taj hotels in goa so we had set our expectations higher, this being the most prestigious hotel of the group. The lobby is the excellent and very classy. The reception staff was good and our check-in very quick. We were allotted a room on the 18th Floor which is the second last floor. The room had an excellent view of Gateway of India and the Arabian sea. The Gateway of india is illuminated at night and it looks marvellous. Regarding the room there is nothing to say. It is the most disspointing part of the stay. As soon as we come out of the elevator the Taj effect goes away and it looks that we are in a 3"
It was a excellent stay and a memorable one in life time. The feeling was more of a prince when i stayed over the Palace wing of Taj Mahal Hotel.  Amazing cuisine choices to make with 4-5 different kinds of restaurants and awesome shopping gallery.
"We didn't stay here overnight but just splashed out Rs 1,600 for the amazing breakfast. It was certainly worth it. There was a huge array of food, including smoked salmon (my favourite food!) and a real cheeseboard with a selection of cheeses. There was also hot and cold food, and eggs could be cooked to order. The service was fantastic. It was just an amazing treat all round,"
I have stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for two nights and the experience was amazing. The best hotel experience ever. One can't ask for more. The service was excellent. Staff were very pleasant and helpful.
"I stayed recently for two nights (6-8 February) at the Taj Mahal,  It was excepcional. I arrived at 5 a.m., much earlier than anticipated, so they got us a room on the spot so we could sleep a couple of hours and arranged for our breakfast. They also upgraded our room. The service was quite good (even if at times there was a slight slackiness, but this was rare). They were exceedingly good regarding our travel arrangements, and sorted a problem of our own making through their own diligence. A great experience in a Bombai landmark."
Arrived late at night / early morning amazing traditional indian welcome.  Room was in the palace wing and was great with excellent bathroom comfy bed and view over the pool and court yard. Had Breakfast by the pool and choice and quality great. Would highly recommend doing the historical tour of the hotel with Viram who's enthusiasm and knowledge of the hotel brings the tour to life. Having stayed in luxury hotels across the world we both agreed the service and atmosphere in this hotel was the best we had experienced and at a fraction of the cost. 
"I stayed at the Taj for two nights, right before my departure from India. The Taj is a classic 5-star hotel. The rooms are spacious, and I had an excellent view of the Gateway of India and the sunrise from my room. When you enter the hotel, you are immediately relaxed with the fresh smell of flowers and the luxurious hotel lobby.  The rooms themselves are a nice mix of classic and modern, and while not the most modern, the decor has a nice colonial feel. The Japanese restaurant in the hotel is extraordinary. The main cafe has a nice, though perhaps overpriced, buffet. There are many street vendors including Bademiya, one of the top rated street vendors in Mumbai, with their excellent chicken tikka wrap. The tourist shops in the local vicinity are aggressive, but easy to ignore. "
"Such a great experience to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, it is also a great escape from Mumbai chaos.  The fact that when we arrived to check in and the receptionist gave us some flower collars and put us on a point (for luck) in our foreheads was way cool!  I loved the palace room we got, the pool area, and the fact that the hotel is on a walkable distance to almost every tourist spot in south Mumbai, although the security check points to get into the hotel may be a bit scary (I mean I never been in such a hotel that have security check points to get in.. but as I see every hotel in India has them).  The restaurants at the Taj are also good, I tried the middle eastern at the top of Taj tower and the Indian one at the palace section,  the sea lounge where I took almost"
"I stayed recently for three nights in an upgraded room in the Palace Wing.  Every long art-filled trip from the elevator to my room was a pleasure.  Best of all was the service.  When I called the butler to ask for help in locating a lost a favorite stole and gave him the cards that aggressive merchants had foisted on me as I wandered the neighborhood, the stole was delivered to my room within 20 minutes.  The concierge desk booked a guide at the last minute for a unusual request.  I appreciated the various restaurants (Souk, Masala Kraft, the Sea Lounge for breakfast) and the Palace lounge for for complimentary snacks and drinks).  The beauty salon had good service and I enjoyed the Yoga instruction, though the space was undergoing construction and I was taught in a regular"
"Despite my monthly travels to Mumbai, I have funnily stayed in the BKC/Lower Pareil area in the last year and a half. Stayed in South Mumbai after ages and at the Taj Mahal after a few years. I was fortunate to be upgraded to the Palace Towers and if you need to stay, that is the wing to try and stay in.  The Palace rooms are large, have an old world charm - what with the old world ceiling fans as well. They however have all the trappings of luxury and charm. Go to the poolside and you will be transported to an era bygone and the tranquility and setting floors you. I happened to go to the Harbour Bar (an institution) and had a couple of drinks. I happened to order their famous Cocktail and the story behind the cocktail - eloquently told by the Barman (I am missing his name) and"
"What a wonderful experience. Fortunate to be  Upgraded from tower wing to palace wing and had the ultimate stay. Views over the Arabian Sea, a breakfast one can only imagine and a bed that dreams are made of! Would love to repeat this stay, can't ask for much more."
"This used to be THE place in Bombay ... Not too sure it is anymore !  Stayed in the Old Wing, and our room had a very unpleasant humidity smell and was not very welcoming. There are so many pigeons around that you don't even want to go near the pool. The breakfast area Is too small and they made us wait too long. On the other hand the staff was very helpful and there are some very nice shops in the Hôtel complex.  Very efficient telephone operator. Our Bill was prepaid but they made us pay a 9 Rps extra !!!"
"Taj Palace hotel in Mumbai still boasts excellent service levels in certain parts of the hotel that we enjoyed in 2004. The shuttle service to and from the hotel was efficient, speedy and very friendly. We did not however, feel welcomed to the hotel in the reception area. We were rushed from the security check outside into the lift and into a room allocated to us. No opportunity to request a room on a higher or lower level floor was provided. The welcome drink that is usually offered to guests in the foyer, was sent up to the room as an after thought. Strange!!!  The service and food in the Shamiana restaurant can only be described as amazing. Early morning breakfast before our flight was most appreciated!!  It is surprising to find a hotel of this stature not offering free wifi"
"We spent a couple of nights here at the start of our 6 week trip to India.  Our room was in the Tower Wing and whilst we didn't have the views the other rooms had it was perfect for our needs as we spent most of our time out of the hotel!    The swimming pool area is lovely and we had a meal on the terrace on our first night and sat drinking tea and reading our books after wandering around the city.  Being so close to the Gateway to India was fantastic as when we first went it was busy so we got up early and went back the following morning - much better although we didn't have time to do any of the boat trips to Elephant Island. On our last night we ate in the Souk, the roof top restuarant which was excellent.  We were at the hotel just before Christmas and during the first"
"I have stayed at this property a few times for short business trips. While the hotel is good and well located, the staff can be a bit more polite.   On the whole, I would still choose to stay there for the location"
"Pros:  - most beautiful architecture in Mumbai  - rooms are best anywhere  - butler service is amazing  - concierge is wonderful (but provided us incorrect info)  - just an extraordinary place, and even better that you can stay there  Cons:  - Restaurants.  The cuisine is boring and average quality.  The service is mediocre.  The prices are insane.  For a small meal without extras or alcohol expect to pay at least ₹10000.  For mediocre food and service this is too high.  Not Taj quality.   - Service (other than butler service). Anytime we left the sixth floor where we were staying, we were treated like cattle. And not good cattle.  At the cafés, it seemed like a chore for anyone to take our order for drinks and even more so to deliver them. For example, and there were several"
"We were fortunate enough to spend 3 nights at this gorgeous and historical property.  It has a rich history and old world elegance that makes me so glad that the Tata family built and maintained this to perfection.   We stayed in a palace suite and its my understanding that the Palace rooms (built in the early 1900s) are much more special than the Tower Rooms that were built in the 70s, so my room tip is that make sure that you spend a little extra on a palace room.   The pool area is beautiful with big arches and an Art Deco feel. The service is impeccable and the entire hotel is spotless.  The breakfast buffet is terrific as well. I am not big on tours but I do suggest that you take the hotel tour to hear about a it rich history. "
"Excellent hotel, all what you need, ask and want is available. Superb restaurants with great food and services. The staff is outstanding and very helpful and friendly. It's very easy to take several walks in the city exploring The Indian way of living, because it's right in the middle close to the Gateway of India."
"The hotel is beautiful.  As many reviewers note, the old palace is gorgeous; the new tower not so much. I booked a low rate room online, so was surprised upon checking in to get a beautiful palace wing room with a private balcony. It had a view of the India Gate and a partial water view. However, I quickly realized the drawback of the room:  there was a private party happening on the terrace below, and there was loud, live music.  I was exhausted from travelling, and tossed and turned for an hour before calling reception.  They immediately apologized and moved me to an ocean view room. It was beautiful. I had to take two sleeping pills to get to sleep, but the staff were so professional about the ordeal (they let me keep everything in the original room, and I just moved myself"
"It is a great pity, that it is necessary to have such strict security measures in place, but understandable in the light of the terrorist attack....However, once through the doors you enter a world of luxury where every guest, regardless of class of room they are staying in, is treated like Royalty. All the staff are attentive, the rooms are kept spotless, and the food and ambiance in the restaurants and bars is perfect. Nothing is too much trouble or impossible. I wish all 5 star hotels would be this good. The only downside for me, and this covers all Taj Hotels, is that wi-fi has become such an essential these days that it should be provided free of charge, although the charge levied here was reasonably low."
"We stayed in Club Room of Palace wing on 01st & 02nd Jan 2014 and our experience was amazing. Each and every service was excellent, it is one of our BEST hotel stay experience ever. From room quality to service to food was amazing. Access to Palace Lounge, high tea, complimentary  cocktail was extraordinary. Earlier we booked for Trident Nariman point, but in the last moment cancelled the same and booked for Taj Mahal Palace and it was worth.  Cant afford to stay during every visit of ours to Mumbai but at least once a year will definitely make it possible and we had all the best experience. Thank you team Taj.  Shiv Bangalore"
"i truly loved my stay at The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai. the quality of food, cleanliness, staff, amenities etc. was just perfect. there is even a starbucks store in the hotel's backyard. i am definitely going there again."
"Very nice hotel, especially the old part. Service is outstanding, so are the rooms, as we are used of the Taj hotels. Very crowdy neighborhood as all the tourists go to visit the gateway of India which is just in front. Coloba is full of nice little shops and you can find everything there; If you want to go somewhere, always trafficjam, so for me the location was not so good. You have to pass the lobby to go to the swimmingpool which was a little inconvenient."
"From the pick up at the airport until the they dropped us back off everything was spectacular. We were given a room in the old part of the hotel which had a small fresco if you wanted to step outside for a few minutes. Our room had 12 - 15 foot ceilings (I am not sure which) and was luxuriously furnished. The bed was very comfortable,.  The hotel and grounds are absolutely spectacular. The pool area is very relaxing and the service (drinks and food) is very good. The gym is better than most hotels and meets the needs for cardio and weight training. The change rooms, sauna and steam room are all very well maintained and the service (as everywhere in the hotel) is excellent.  When it comes to food you just cannot go wrong. We were only awake a couple of times in time for breakfast"
"We spent few nights at the Old part of the hotel then came back for one evening in the new wing. The experience is just perfect, even though in India the luxury hotels have to check the car for security, tere is a away of doing everything smoothly, people never shouts even after having spent hours in the horrible traffic. The hotel is a dream come true with a mix of the English and Indian refinement; a pure joy, may it last for a long time"
"Lovely Indian service, warm welcome (with flowers) and a drink. Stayed in the Palace Wing (highly recommend as this section has been renovated) with a room overlooking the Gateway to India. Wonderful service, attention to detail in the room (from thoughtful small gifts to the staff inserting a Taj Palace bookmark in my book where they saw I had turned down a page corner). Rooms and baths are well appointed and the property is beautifully maintained, clean and comfortable. Beds were perfect. I can't say a negative thing about this property."
"My family from the US, Europe and India have just enjoyed a fabulous stay in the Palace wing of 'The Taj' in Mumbai. The rooms, the service and the food were excellent. Thank you for making our stay for mum's 80th birthday so memorable. Mum has been visiting The Taj for over 60 years and this was a special moment for her."
"After having a drink in one of the hotel's bars in 2010 I told my girlfriend that if we ever came back to Mumbai then we could stay at this hotel, and on this trip I fulfilled my promise. The experience did not disappoint and I'm very glad we decided to stay here. The pool area is absolutely stunning and spending an afternoon there is real luxury. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants but the prices did not look too bad at all considering the cost of the hotel.  Our room in the Tower Wing was also fantastic. It was slightly larger than I expected and was tastefully furnished. I found the staff at the hotel to be very professional and efficient. They are obviously well trained. I would love to stay at this hotel again in the future.  My only real complaint is that the WIFI"
"We came to Mumbai for a special birthday and were not disappointed in any way!   We were met at the airport at an ungodly hour by a wonderfully courteous driver in a very swish car and whisked through the empty streets of Mumbai to the Taj.   Even though it was 2 in the morning we were greeted like royalty and escorted to our room in the Palace wing, a club room on the sixth floor with a view of the Gate and sea.   A superbly comfortable and huge bed - the room was not massive but large enough with a luxurious bathroom - all marble, with a TV installed in the mirror!     Breakfast was normally quite busy but we always sat outside which (despite the large numbers of crows and pigeons!) was nice and peaceful.  The buffet was plentiful and we opted for the Indian dishes.    We"
"The stay started off with an amazing, warm welcome. The hotel delights you with world-class restaurants, a stunning lounge and a beautiful pool. The staff is very accommodative and takes care of the requests promptly. If you are looking to indulge in shopping the hotel offers a shopping center. Come here to experience the class and standard that Taj stands for."
"A lovely heritage hotel with so much history -- plus outstanding service and well appointed rooms with a wonderful view of the Gateway to India. From the arrival experience  to the special touches in the room. my stay was wonderful. I stayed in the Palace Wing and highly recommend it as this part of the hotel has been recently renovated Great breakfast by the pool, fantastic location close to shopping and other sites and restaurants.great experience..,"
"We stayed here for 3 nights in January 2013. Out room was amazing - beautifully furnished and immaculately clean. The bathroom was stunning floor to ceiling white marble.   My partner's parents also stayed here- they were in a room in the new wing, which did not have as nice a bathroom, but had a lovely view.  The breakfast room (Sea Room?) had an amazing view of the ocean and the Gateway monument. We enjoyed sitting up by the windows where you can watch the people stroll by.  It is a great location with the gateway monument literally across the road, and a 5 minute walk to Leopold's restaurant.  Staff were really friendly and the concierge was very helpful in organising a tour guide for as at moment's notice.   A highlight of our trip for sure"
"Taj Mahal palace is iconic property and Tata group has done full justice by renovating this property to best standards after a tragic event few years back. We stayed in the old wing and rooms are really big with all the modern amenities. View from the room is of Gateway of India, which is one of the most visited tourist attraction in Mumbai. Food/drinks are excellent at all the restaurants and cafes."
For me this is the best hotel in Mumbai.It has a certain wonderful  ambience which no other hotel in Mumbai has.Its excellent location making it close to the shopping and entertainment areas and to the sea really adds to its splendour.This hotel is excellent in every way except it for being quite pricey.
"I dont think there's a hotel in India that can beat the Taj Mahal, Mumbai in terms of heritage, service, ambience & whatever it takes to make a hotel world class.  The service is exceptional, staff is extremely courteous & will do anything possible to make you comfortable. Rooms are exceptionally well kept.   Our butler even gave us 2 old paintings of the Taj on check out.   The Creme Brulee in the coffee shop is to die for!!"
"Loved this legendary hotel.  The location is fantastic, if you like to be in the thick of it.  Wasn't fussed about the new section of the hotel but we stayed in the Heritage Wing with a sea-facing room with a view of the Indian Gate. It was my daughter's birthday on the day that we arrived and the hotel had decked out her room with balloons, rose petals and a ""Happy Birthday"" pillow - she was thrilled!  We loved eating breakfast outside around the magnificent pool area.  We ate at Souk (just ok) and Masala (excellent).  Hotel staff were great.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  "
"First off, this is an incredible hotel with a fascinating history. If it's your first visit to Mumbai, it's worth staying at the Taj for that reason alone. That said, lower your expectations on the service."
"Well, 85 countries visited-a lot of outstandng hotels. Where this hotel wins points is the service levels are top notch. Were it fails is the Wi Fi. A bone of contention with me. It is a rip off to charge $16 per day. In a city where there are more IT experts than beggars (and that is saying something) it is disgraceful that such an iconic hotel (often fully booked) feels the need to charge for this, it is almost as free as fresh air to be fair! So, it's a money making machine! Restaraunts and alcholic drinks are as you would expect expensive. I was in the Palace wing and the butler service is exemplary. The pool suffers from a lack of sun loungers; the male health club is poor. The steam and sauna will fit just 4-5 people. It is also outdated and there is no Jacquzi and even"

That said, lower your expectations on the service.  Our experience at the Taj may have been unique -- it was a holiday weekend and the hotel was packed -- but my husband and I were disappointed by the level of service offered by such a renown hotel.   During our stay, the Indian government was preparing for the 26 January National Day celebrations.  As part of those preparations, they were conducting sound checks for the concert to be held right across the street from the hotel at the Gateway to India.  We were taken aback by the volume of this sound check.  We were in a sea facing room and the water glass on our desk was"
"This is one of the few hotels in the world where the overused word ""iconic"" truly applies.  The photo gallery in the passageway connecting the old hotel to the newer wing attests to this, as does the daily at 5 pm tour of the property offered to guests.  We stayed in the heritage wing, which has charm and service to match.  The various hotel facilities are a treat.  Even at the height of the breakfast rush hour, service in the Sea Lounge was always gracious.  And the location across from the Gateway of India and near to all of the sights of South Mumbai is ideal."
it is the most wonderfull hotel ;a grand setting with sweeping views and a great piece of architecture.but inside the reals jewels are to found.service unsurpassed and passed over with a genuine smile.you feel that the staff are proud to work there and serve you. nothing can be faulted and you just feel like a prince at all times magnificent
"There is a reason why this hotel is considered one of the finest in the world.   This is truly a grande dame hotel. The service is sublime at every level - the driver who collected us was charming and friendly, and took a detour to give us a bit of an unusual insider's view of Mumbai. The welcome at the hotel where we were greeted by name as we stepped out of the car was followed by a personalized check-in in the room. The staff by the pool and in the restaurants were clearly well-trained but also managed to infuse that training with the magic smile and friendliness that we encountered all over India and which seems to come so naturally to Indians. The concierge was extremely professional without being uptight, and the front desk staff were polite without being obsequious.  The"
"As first time visitors to the sub-Continent the Taj Mahal Palace was indeed the gateway introduction to my Wife & myself in every sense. Our four day stay was a joy from beginning to end with hospitality and courtesy at its finest. We stayed in a spacious and beautifully appointed deluxe sea view room in the Palace Wing with a brilliant close up perspective of the Gateway to India from the 4th floor, very close to the elevators. All the facilities from the bed, linen, furnishings, bath, shower, towels,  and toiletries were of the highest quality & the room itself was serviced twice a day efficiently, impeccably & timely. The service throughout the hotel was professional and friendly at all times and a special mention also ought to be made about the security personnel who carried"
"From beautiful (complimentary upgrade to Club Floor) Palace Wing room, to knowledgeable unfailingly gracious housekeeping, concierge, reception, etc. staff, to pool, salon, restaurants, shops, the Taj has it all. Enjoyed complimentary tour of hotel as well as an Art tour in hotel. A definite must stay place!"
"The service from the beginning to the end is perfect. We ask for a tour and a guide in Spanish and they did everything to find it and they found it!!! We ask for a room with a view of the Gateway of India, the views are spectaculars."
I had a stay of four days in first week of Jan 14 after a long break and found to be still in excellent ambiance after all odd events taken place few years back. Good shopping malls and fantastic Spa. I will visit again.
"If you are going to Mumbai & want to feel like a royal highness of the Indian modern times, this hotel is your haven ! Spread across a vast area , this hotel stands tall in the middle of a bustling coastline of Mumbai southern most part. The opulence is visibly displayed via beautiful indian architecture that gives TAJ the feel of a Palace indeed.  Not only is this hotel impeccable in its hospitality but also the Hotel is very well-situated in the heart of south mumbai, Travelling to north-side of the town will be a long distance though ! The breakfast spread is great but in reality its the experience that this culturally rich HOtel provides is what leaves every visitor in a state of trance. The hotel is sound-proof & noise is never an issue! Rooms are spacious & the beds are"
"From the moment we landed landed in Mumbai and were met by the hotel driver to the moment we left, we felt as though we had been transported into a different world. The service at the Taj has to be experienced to be believed - at times I felt as though my mind  was being read! Nothing was too much trouble and staff were proactive in their approach to this.  I had chosen the Taj as it was my husband's  50th birthday and he loves heritage hotels. It didn't disappoint!   We stayed in the Palace Wing which was stunning. We ate in  Marsala in the evening which was great. Breakfast was fantastic too. There was also a lounge we could access in the day for complimentary drinks and snacks which was lovely.   My 3 sons loved the pool and would have happily spent the day in it if I hadn't"
"Our experience at the Taj Palace is, indeed, worthy of all superlatives that the English lexicon has to offer. Simply put, you greeted us like royalty, treated us like family. What more could one expect?! The Taj, for us, has come to symbolize the virtual perfection of excellence. Period!"
"The Taj is in fact 2 hotels - The old original hotel where alll the hotel services are situated and this is just fabulous. However the 'new wing' which is not so new, I would guess circa 1975, is like staying in a ghastly South London council estate block. It is a little shabby and past its best and more to the point it has very poor soundproofing. We had 2 rooms in this concrete block and were kept awake all night with, firstly the traffic and then by other guests in nearby rooms. Stay here, BUT get a room in the original hotel do not stay in the new wing no matter how much cheaper it is - You will be disappointed."
"I stayed at this hotel for 5 days loved everything about it,typical 5 star no complaints.so then comes check out day,what I usually do while I'm staying at any hotel I stash my money some in the safe and then have a little back up hid some where else,for this occasion thinking I'm in one of the most prestigious hotels in the whole of India.while presidents and famous stars have stayed here I didn't really take as much caution as I usually do,I just hid my back up cash in my case stashed in a shoe usually locked up when I'm out of the room,but some times as you may all know in the mornings we wake up to rush down to breakfast I may of left my case unlocked,anyway to cut a long story short come check out day I'm packing my bags empty my safe and realise my £1000 I stashed in my"
"A lovely heritage hotel with so much history -- plus outstanding service and well appointed rooms with a wonderful view of the Gateway to India.  From the arrival experience (flowers and drinks in the private lounge) to the special touches in the room (small gifts left each day and the staff inserted a Taj Mahal book mark in my book when they noticed I had folded down the page) - my stay was wonderful. I stayed in the Palace Wing and highly recommend it as this part of the hotel has been recently renovated  Great breakfast by the pool, fantastic location close to shopping and other sites and restaurants.  I highly recommend this property - to the first time visitor or to others, like me, who travel frequently in India.  I will definitely come back to this hotel and recommend it"
"The best place to stay in Mumbai... Amazing view of The gateway of India and also of the Arabain sea. Just an amazing place to stay. Great prime location in Colaba, South Mumbai. The Hotel stands as the pride of inida."
"Few experiences have come close in my experience to the amount of attention and thought to detail paid by staff from housekeeping to the butler to the waitstaff at the restaurants. Opulence rarely matched, Mr Tata's legacy lives on...It's service, coupled with its heritage, staying at the hotel is a travel experience in itself. They even had a tour. Highly recommended..."
"The Taj Mahal Palace hotel is very upscale. Upon check in, you get your own personal staff escorting you through the entire hotel explaining all the amenities. The place just reeks of opulence. The restaurants were high end. We only ate sushi at Wasabi by Morimoto and it was expensive. It was our last night in India, so we went for the gusto.  The service was excellent and the ambiance was elegant. The breakfast was very tasty and had good variety. The hotel is located by the water and the West India Gate and we walked everywhere from the hotel. Shopping was abundant nearby. The concierge was very helpful in directing you to places you wanted to visit.  The hotel boasts a long list of celebrities as former guests with their pictures displayed in a case.  We had a room in the"
"My wife and I are from New Zealand and were privileged to spend 4 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai (December 2013) en-route to Spain  and Portugal -  This is an iconic hotel with superb rooms and service standards unmatched anywhere else. Every aspect of our stay was well looked after ,often proactively, before we could ask for stuff.   As it happens I sprained my back on the second day and casually asked the hotel if they might be able to help. They went out of their way to organise a top end Physiotherapist from Bombay Hospital to visit me at the hotel at a very reasonable rate ($30 a visit) - He set me right over two days, otherwise our onward journey to Spain and Portugal would have been a disaster.  The room was exquisite - the food was excellent as was the"
"The best things tend to be done with ease and simplicity.  The Taj Mahal, epitomises this definition.  From the moment the car turns into the entrance and you are whisked away into your room, the experience is simply magical. The attention of the staff, the care they display to ensure that your stay is memorable and thoroughly enjoyable is exemplary.   Have stayed at this hotel several times and the staff recognise you and are generous in their efforts. The poolside restaurant, Aquarius, is a great place to enjoy breakfast as well snacks throughout the day. The restaurant Souk, is simply wonderful.   The rooms are spacious, well appointed. If you get the chance stay at this palace!"
"Held my conference at this hotel, really amazing place. Rooms are a little on the small size, but given age of hotel, not surprising. Food and service is outstanding and would highly recommend to anyone. Truly one of the top hotels in the world."
"I emailed to ask if they received my preferences form, and if I could make additional bookings for airport transfers, high tea at the Sea Lounge and perhaps the spa. Two days later, the spa responded with their menu of services, but I didn't hear back regarding my other requests. The next day, I finally received a response, and they were trying to make room bookings for me, even if my email clearly articulated my last name, number of rooms booked and dates, and each query/request laid out in bullets. I responded and doubly clarified that I've fully paid for my rooms and that I wanted to make bookings for airport pickup and the sea lounge. 2 days later no response so far from what is supposed to be the best hotel in the city, if not the country. This could have been sorted out"
"I had the privilege of staying at the palace wing of the Taj which was truly an experience to cherish. The executive suite has a personalised touch, something to 'delight' at every corner, every need anticipated and thought about, making a guest feel very very special and welcome. This is legendary Taj hospitality at its best. I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Parveen Chander and his team for looking after us and for this unforgettable experience. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a truly royal experience in the heart of Mumbai!"
"As soon we entered our room in Taj we got feeling of traveling in time. The room is very pretty, but with authentic feeling of being greatest in the past. It gives you this luxury vintage feeling, participating in event, which does not exist anymore. Our favorite place in the hotel was cafe area by the pool, with hidden tables among palm trees. The old part of the hotel looks like some palace museum, and indeed there are sightseeing tours organized by the front desk. It is not possible to compare this hotel with any other luxurious places we stayed in - it is one a kind hotel that I do strongly recommend to stay in while visiting Mumbai."
"This hotel cituated in a workderful place, room neatness, behaviour of employees, services etc all are very good. Good food, value, location spa etc all are very good...views of beautiful and very good."
"This hotel is simply one of the best hotels in the world! The rooms are amazing and have all the amenities in absolute luxury. It houses the most amazing restaurants in Mumbai and has incredible views! The most impressive part of the hotel is the staff and the attention to detail - i was blown away by the small things that they do, right down to rolling up laptop chargers and binding them in velcro if they are left in the room. I don't believe there are better hotels in the world and at the rates you pay it is simply a steal!"
This taj is a magical place..with aview of beautiful old mumbai at one side and gateway and sea on d other side. It has all suite rooms and they r a wo der in themselves. I stayed in d palace wing and i dont remember the room name but it was a palatial room with a study and a dining and a living room. It had a great maharaja carpeted staircase with a taj arcade which had d worlds best brands in it. The service we received was maharaja and its a beautiful palace to stay in
"Great service from the friendly staff. Clean and comfortable hotel, with a lovely view of the sea. We had a great time at the hotel and in Mumbai. Theres lots to see within walking distance from the hotel. Otherwise the hotel arranges transport for you within second. Enjoy Mumbai."
"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, in the Palace wing, and it was fabulous. The hotel is huge and the decor is fantastic. The attention to detail in the furniture, layout is commendable. Service is flawless, the breakfast was the one of the best, and nothing was too much to ask, they were happy to make whatever everyone was asking for. The staff at the hotel are super trained, very attentive and accommodating. We dined at the Indian restaurant in the hotel and it was excellent, and full on a monday evening. In fact I noticed all the restaurants at the hotel are very popular. The bar at the hotel is also brilliant, top notch service. It's so chaotic outside the hotel due to the popular location and busy road, but another world as soon as you step into the lobby."
This is the best hotel to stay in Mumbai. Location is perfect and it is right in front of the gateway of India. What makes this hotel 5 star apart from the beautiful interior is the staff.  They were probably the most efficient and friendly hotel staff I've ever come across. I recommend this hotel to both business travellers and tourists.  My favourite staff were Indrajeet (Team Professional) and Viren ( Manager - Experiences) two gentlemen.
"It was great to stay in taj... Gorgeous location, mind blowing facilities, staff is good, food is excellent, free wifi, airport pickup and drop facilities, it's good to stay there and again I'll be stay in the taj mahal"
"TheTaj Palace was, of course, beautiful, the service flawless and the staff extremely accomodating... we would fly to Mumbai from California just to stay there!  We stayed at the Taj for two days at the beginning of our South India tour and on one day before our return to the States.  So much attention to detail, excellent cuisine, caring and knowledgeable staff... Shangra-La in a hotel!"
"Taj is located in a perfect location in Mumbai. We stayed in Taj for 2 days and loved every bit of it. Right from food, service, décor, people everything was perfect. And to add to the beauty right in front of the room window you could see the peaceful sea. Had the most relaxed time of my life. Would like to visit it soon again."
"This is one of the best properties in India and Mumbai. Located at the southernmost tip of the city, this hotel has seen India through the ages. Located bang opposite to the Gateway of India - this is a great place to stay if you are visiting India for the first time.   You can try some of the Indian cuisines here as they are authentic and the chef can make it to suit your taste - which is the best part.   Their rooms and interiors are amazing with great architecture."
"An amazing location, an amazing experience, from ""A to Z"" all have been perfect, thanks a lot Taj, people are perfectly caring, service is unique and simply at its best. As a simple suggestion, a new lay-out and furniture would enhance the quality of this prestigious hotel.  Amazing, thank you."
"this hotel is among one of the famous hotels in india and abroad. as you enter, the hotel staff greets you overwhelmingly. thats not all. go ahead and you will experience service at its best. they make the guests feel like real kings and queens in the tal mahal palace."
"We spent 3 nights at the hotel from 22 to 25 December 2013. We had a room on the 19th floor of the Tower side (the rooms on the Palace side are apparently better). The room was a bit oldish. The level of service is good but nothing in particular to mention. Breakfast is best taken outside with view on the pool. The service during breakfast was somehow disorganized and chaotic and the breakfast itself was standard without any highlight. From a general service perspective, the staff has much to learn from the level of service that customers get at The Oberoi"
"We stayed here for a couple of nights recently, amazing experience, although our Premier Tower room looked a little tired in some corners, the bed, shower and other facilities were all excellent.    We didn't eat in any of the restaurants but if the breakfast was anything to go buy I'm sue it would have been amazing as the breakfast was truly brilliant!  The hotel is in the perfect location to explore Colaba and special mention for the service, all staff were simply excellent, the service was really out of this world, they also let us check-in over three hours early so eternally grateful for this as we had just arrived after an awful overnight coach trip from Goa.   For those who can, this hotel is a great experience when staying in Mumbai."
What can you say about this place. it is just awesome. The food is excellent. the rooms are the best. Ambiance is great. Even the location is great. Very near to my favourite the Tendulkars restaurant.
"Masala Kraft is one of the restaurants inside Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai. Masala Kraft is a lovely dining option. The staff are courteous and helped us decide on the order. They were patient enough to explain the specialties in store.  The plates are silver and the utensils are brass. Many foreigners throng the place to catch up with a quick indian version of tomato soup. The restaurant overlooks the swimming pool. For newbies, the restaurant follows dress codes and the tables are to booked well in advance to avoid disappointments. We were served with lemon grass soup, roti and langar wali dal with fresh steamed rice. We also munched through a plate of sweet platter. Though, a bit on the expensive side- it's worth every penny. It is a definite visit on my cards if i get to visit"
This is the best hotel to stay in Mumbai. Nice location and it is right infront of the gateway of India. which is the best evening outing. The staff is very nice and cordial and made my stay great. I recommend this hotel anytime
"We stayed here just after New Year and absolutely loved it. The hotel is steeped in history (the heritage tour every day at 5pm is good because it gets you around the various things to see but the delivery is a little pre-rehearsed we found). Our room was great and we loved the whole experience. The pool is amazingly relaxed given its location. It gets limited sun during the day so you have to keep relocating to another deck but that doesn't detract from the experience. Overall, I would say that if you get any chance to stay here, take it. It is one of THE great hotel experiences."
"Nice place and restaurants although the room is a bit small. Must stay in the Palace side. The spa is good and the therapist is very professional. However since it locates right next to Gateway of India, and the place is always crowd and chaotic somehow, upset the journey back to hotel everyday."
"Been visiting this hotel about four times a year for the last decade or so and it remains my favourite hotel in the entire world. I call it jokingly my 'second home' but i am sure all of its many regulars also do this. Why? The staff and attention to detail. It's smart, classy and represents the best of 'shining' India. It's also super efficient: some examples. I did my Amazon india shopping from London in early December 2013 and put the taj as the delivery address.  the Taj had no problem with that. THey emailed from india whenever a package arrived and i was relieved to know my 'bollywood products' were delivered safely and being kept securely for me. When I checked into my room upon arrival, presto - they called and my packages were delivered. As i was going to Madurai in"
"We celebrated our anniversary at Taj Mahal Palace and Taj made it a perfect stay for us. After a wonderful meal, we wanted to head back to our room for a inhouse movie. They sent us complimentary popcorn with coke with the movie. Also sent us a complimentary chocolate cake."
"My daughter and I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace at the conclusion of a tour of Northern India in December 2012.  It was superb.  We were upgraded from a Taj Club Room to a Suite which was spacious, luxurious and gorgeous.  Being somewhat of an insomniac also practical for watching some television in the middle of the night and not disturbing anyone.  The stay was a gift for my birthday and a cake was left for us one evening, along with a card, earrings and bracelets.  Towels sculptured into animals with rose petals.  I could go on and on.  I don't normally choose 5* establishments as they always seem a bit stuffy but the staff go out of their way to make guests feel valued, special and comfortable.  We had such a special time that we decided to meet up again for NYE 2013, my"
"The highlight of my stay at the Taj was a visit to the Jiva Spa. The atmosphere, facilities and massage therapies offered by the spa are excellent and reasonably priced (for a luxury hotel). The service at the hotel was great, too (the concierge sent someone out to get me cough drops from a chemist and I was only charged 16 INR or 27 cents USD).   My husband and I ate at Wasabi by Morimoto which was a nice change after nearly a full week of Indian food (also - for the red-meat eaters out there - there IS steak on the menu - something rare in Mumbai). There are several other restaurants and a nice poolside dining area, too. However, their complimentary breakfast buffet was a bit inconsistent in terms of quality. I would definitely go earlier for less of a crowd and better"
"I have stayed at some lovely hotels over the years, but I can't think of any that come close to the Taj. It begins at the airport, being met with a Manager, driver and a Mercedes. The driver alerts the hotel to one's arrival and you are greeted by a line-up of staff and given a Lei greeting and traditional welcome kumkum (forehead) ceremony. Check-in is done in the room where bags have already been placed.  The hotel is spectacular architecturally and visually. The enclosed gardens and pool are an oasis of tranquility and calm with beautiful walkways and seating areas.  As for the room, there is nothing more one could ask for, and the service borders on over the top in that just walking to an elevator causes a staff member to rush ahead and get it for you.  Beautiful lobby area"
"You really expect the best service when you stay in a hotel as illustrious as this. However, my family's experience of the Taj Palace was somewhat less than satisfactory. Upon arrival, we were told that wifi in the hotel is not free of charge, which I always think, when you are paying for 5*, is both incredibly insulting and cheap. One of the so called welcome 'cocktails,' (warm juice from concentrate served in a smeary glass) actually contained one of the bar staff's name tags in it… The food in the cafe took forever, served by unsmiling, unapologetic waiters, and came out both patchy in standard and at totally different times. I'd already finished my sandwich and had time to compose an email by the time my sister's smoked salmon with condiments finally arrived in its entirety"
The Taj is without doubt the most sumptuous best managed hotel I have ever stayed in. The attention to detail is perfect. Every member of the staff we met was charming and one got the impression they were proud and happy to be working here and that was reflected in the excellent service we received at every level.  High tea in the Sea Lounge was an experience not to be missed and excellent value considering the amazing display of mouth watering delicacies on offer.  We had stopped off on our way to Goa and I would thoroughly recommend a Mumbai stopover just to have the opportunity of a few days at the taj...i cant wait to come back.
"Best service I've had in any hotel at any price.  Without exception, the friendliest and most attentive staff - a complete pleasure to be around.  Incredible attention to detail - everyone knows you and remembers you and your details (e.g., travel services, concierge, etc.).  Rooms are equally spectacular - hard to find a surface in the hotel or room that isn't covered in Carrara marble and immaculate.  Highly recommend because it is also a great value."
"The Taj has excellent service, with employees who really strive to help. Although not cheap, the food is marvelous and the setting is sublime. The location is wonderful, and one cannot do better in Mumbai, or almost anywhere else for that matter!"
"The greeting after a long international flight was amazing.  We were sat down in a reception room fit for a Maharaja and offered sweet drinks and garlands of flowers.  We were promptly escorted to the room where our bags had already arrived.  There are magnificent views of the harbor from the old wing.  The rooms are large, well kept up, and luxuriously finished with both classic and modern touches.  There were plentiful outlets for all the modern electric appliances of travel.  The bed was extremely comfortable with high thread count linen.  The bath was large and opulent.  After unpacking, we left for a quick bite and on return all of our electric charging cords were coiled up and velcro-ed.  A gel mouse pad was supplied under our mouse.  Microfiber cleaning clothes were"
"What a different experience to the previous Taj hotel on this trip, this is clearly the jewel in the Taj Crown. Impeccable service, very high standards and a fabulous location make this a must stay hotel."
Stayed here over Xmas and have to say that the previous reviews are all accurate.  Staying at the Taj is about being treated 'like a king'  We were upgraded from the Tower to the Palace & it is truly magnificent.  This is the best hotel i have every stayed in.... Totally highly recommend....
"Stayed four nights including nye.  Was upgraded from tower to palace wing and the room was stunning (as was the rest of the palace wing) which has been refurbished to a fantastic level of detail and style!  Of note are the friendly staff (esp. viren who demonstrates such passion on the heritage tour, Hemel who kept the drinks flowing on nye!), the fabulous restaurants, the great view across the gateway to india, the pool and gym.  I could write at length describing the many positives of my stay at this oasis in Colaba but I will simply say that it is one of my favourite hotels in the world, is genuinely a heritage location and will be my home every time I come to Mumbai.  Thanks and best wishes to all of the staff."
"Stayed with family for 4 nights during new years eve into new year. Excellent service during check-in at reception with personal escort to take you to your room.   Non-Muslims welcomed in traditional Indian way with garland and vermilion on forehead.  Excellent Breakfast  with wide variety and personal service. Excellent Room facilities. A  truly 6 star hotel .   From entrance staff at the main gate , to reception and breakfast staff ,  All staff gave personal attention.    Lisha from guest executive arranged for a late checkout , a truly professional.   Very impressed with modern Gym facilities.  Only luxury hotel opposite gateway of India. Very highly recommended ."
Sea Lounge was very pleasant - Great views very nice food - if you go the salon they will charge you 750 rupies but without haircut just shampoo and blow dry the double 1250 rupies? - Seems like she saw the opportunity to overcharge us . Ask twice - 
"A landmark hotel - not only for historical reasons but for excellent service, staff and amenities it provides ! Bars, restaurants, lounges, pools, gardens- everything takes you back to an era that was regal and opulent and very charmingly service oriented. Views are breathtakingly beautiful with Gateway of India and Arabian Sea stretched out before you... The most unique feature that Taj has incorporated to its hotel is the tour of the hotel with the guide narrating the history of the hotel and the area around it. It was just not any tour...the narration was so woven with interesting anecdotes, poetry and commentaries that it hardly seems like a tour and more like a visual journey through ages !! Our guide Viren was an expert at that ! I have been to Mumbai quite a few times"
"We had the most amazing stay at the Taj, Mumbai... The hospitality extended by the staff was fabulous. The hotel has been maintained impeccably and the service is top notch.  Every staff I came across throughout the stay never failed to smile and greet, the food was mouth watering, the ambience absolutely elegant but the most important and touching aspect was that the staff went out of their way to assist us in everything.... I never got a no for an answer....  Thank you Taj Mahal Mumbai for an absolutely wonderful stay...."
"We booked the Taj Mahal as a treat to ourselves for the last night of our 15 day tour of India. The level of service we received was exceptional and being upgraded to a suite in the Palace Wing was a fantastic bonus. Our night of luxury at the Taj included a tour of the hotel where we learnt about its history, followed by a pre-drink in one of the bars before ending the evening with a curry in the Indian restaurant. Many thanks to all the staff for a fantastic stay"
"Looking for a hotel that treats you like a Maharani or maharaja? This hotel is the one for you. I would definitely recommend staying in the Heritage wing too. the hotel staff were superb; bedrooms, bathrooms, toiletries, treats were all excellent. this was a hotel experience I will never forget!  Thank you everyone at the Taj Mahal palace Mumbai."
Beautiful hotel with MF Hussain s paintings at the reception. Celebrities and Politicians visit there regularly Queen of England Barack Obama Sarkozy and others sign in the Golden Book... Security is tight which is nice... International and chic guests and service is very personalized for every guest.. Beautiful swimming pool. Our room was simple but comfortable. We dined in the French restaurant but I am disappointed about the food because it is very less for a big bill. I am French and it is not the first time I am going for fine dining but it was really small. Food is good in general and must there is a little smokers corner by the pool where you can enjoy and expresso or drink and relax. I guess it depends how much you are ready to pay to get a nice room... still it was very
"Call me biased because I'm an Indian, but 'The Taj' is in my humble opinion, the best hotel I have ever stayed in. From the moment your door is opened by the ever friendly and impeccably dressed security, from the moment you walk into the hotel lobby and are greeted by smiles, the scent of fresh roses, the decor, it just takes you to another place!  I have been lucky enough to stay there a few times, and the service is second to none, period. Very member of the staff always greet you with a smile, and genuinely want to assist you. As with all Taj hotels, the staff do not accept gratuity, and this is what makes there desire to assist so fulfilling.  The rooms are fantastic, spacious and well presented, clean with all the mod-cons you would expect in any five star hotel. The pool"
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay of 2 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace. There is so much to do there, with the various restaurants, bars, lounges, gardens, business centre, swimming pool and other amenities. I particularly liked the tour of the hotel which takes place at 5 pm each day, where you learn about the history of the hotel, and also having breakfast and other meals in the Sea Lounge, such an elegant cafe/restaurant with magnificent views of the Gateway of India and the ocean. On the first night I stayed in the Tower Wing, where the rooms are comfortable, if a little plain. However I was disturbed by noise from along the corridor, so on the second night the hotel kindly moved me to a room in the Palace Wing, which was out of this world for comfort and style. My thanks to the"
"We stayed four nights at the beginning of our tour of India.  The room and service could not have been better, and we were able to sleep well enough to get over the jet lag in one day.  The waiters at breakfast recognized us after the first day and everyone went out of their way to make us feel comfortable as we got used to the Indian environment.  Even the fitness room was superior."
I could not praise this hotel more. It was fantastic. as soon as our car pulled up we had porters taking our luggage we also had a full Indian greeting with flowers. The gentleman took em to my room showed me around and explained how everything worked he linked up my phone and lap top to the wifi and had a tea delivered to my room as soon as I asked.   The food was outstanding in the we ate in Wasabi the first night and it was the best Japanese I've ever had.O Our final night we went to SOUK again food was outstanding and the waiters allowed us to have small tried of the menu to see what we fancied.   The Bedrooms were huge and my view of the gateway and sea was fantastic.   The area outside was a little depressing as there was a lot of beggars.  The pool area and service was
On our last day we decided to stay at the iconic Taj Mahal Palace. We chose the palace wing with a sea facing view. The level of customer service we received upon checking in to checking out was world class. All the staff we encountered went out of their way to ensure we were fully satisfied from the food to the entertaining time travel walk hosted by Viren. In the evening we enjoyed a barbecue dinner by the poolside. The sea food was well done and service exceeded expectations. Later we tried the famous cocktails at the harbour bar. After this we explored the hotel admiring original artwork. We are also delighted we stayed during the festive season as this made the stay even more enchanting. Special hats off to the pianist who played 'Happy Birthday' for one of our party and
"This is not our first time staying here, and every time it is a great experience. We now booked a few rooms, instead of a suite. A lot more noise from the street side but the rooms themselves are comfortable and spacious. Service is incredible. Every waiter is experienced and goes out of his way to make sure you enjoy your meal. The Chinese restaurant and the Indian restaurant are outstanding. Ask for Kiran and Shohayb, outstanding staff.The Japanese restaurant is one of the best in the world. Worth every penny and highly recommended. The Taj never disappoints and that's why we keep coming back!"
"When someone serves with such poise and grace that your needs are met  but you still do not notice, it leaves one to wonder the level of perfection. After a while, I could not help but to ask the waiter in the breakfast lounge on how may years has he worked. He replied - ""37 years at Taj"" and that answers it all. Great job."
"Ok, so paying to be picked up at the airport and driven to the hotel where they do check in in your room is great, as is the view of Gateway of India...but this place is a huge tourist attraction for people in Mumbai so the Xmas period we were there was chaotic, crowded and we couldn't get into 2 restaurants even though we were staying there, not recommended at festive times, might be great later."
Couldn't fault this hotel in any level. Everything was excellent including food and service. I would go as far as saying it's the service I've very experienced in a hotel. The Chinese and the Indian restaurant were excellent. It's the first time I've eaten at hotel restaurants and was suppressed at the quality. The dim sum in the Asian restaurant was unbelievable. If I'm in Mumbai again I will definitely stay there.
"Location was great, in middle of busyness of Mumbai, Great view from our room. Service was excellent. Breakfast was great.  Price too much for small room we've got and too busy with internal and wedding event."
"the hotel is located on perfect place, the gateway of india just front of the hotel. Service was excellent, Breakfast was great.  Room we had was small for the price we paid, and too busy of internal or wedding event."
"Many years ago, when I was 16 and living in Calcutta, my parents took us on a tour of India and one of the stops we stayed at was the Taj in Bombay. I still remember the prawn cocktails and delicious coffee and the danish pastry at breakfast and our suite with wood and gold panelling. I have such lovely memories of this trip that I wanted my Italian husband to experience India just the way I did, so many years ago. So off we went on our 11 city vacation where I pulled out all the stops to showcase my country, staying at the most beautiful Taj and Oberoi hotels for 30 days.  The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai, did not disappoint. After being garlanded and showered with rose petals we were ushered to Club Room 278 with private butler in the main palace wing of the hotel, with a"
"We were guests at the Taj Palace in late October, arriving by ship from Athens after 15 nights through the Suez Canal and ""Pirates Alley"".  The temperature in Mumbai at the time was around 93F with oppressive humidity. On the ride from the port to the hotel, my shirt was soaked and we were most uncomfortable.  Arriving at the Taj, we were warmly welcomed, our check-in expedited, and off to our 6th floor suite overlooking the Gateway to India.  Our butler offered to unpack our luggage (we declined), and after quick showers, we enjoyed a lovely lunch poolside.    It was painful to recall that just five years prior to our arrival, the hotel was the scene of a terrorist attack taking many lives of hotel employees and guests.  Those contemplating a stay should obtain a copy of ""The"
Our first visit to Mumbai an exceptional city full of life and surprises.  We stayed at the Taj and even being a family group of 12 aged 7-72 you could find no fault.  The hotel has timeless beauty with exceptional service world class food. It is a striking contrast to the hustle of Mumbai and puts you at ease as soon as you walk in the door.  Sunrise each morning from the hotel room over the gateway to India is an incredible site.  Well done Taj well done Mumbai.
"My wife, son and daughter in law stayed for a few nights recently. Great location and service. The pool being a massive plus. However the food was rubbish and ridiculously expensive for India. I could provide details of breakfast and their specialist restaurants but, alternatively, you can take my word for it."
"The main lobby part of the hotel is incredibly impressive without a doubt but we were sorely disappointed. True, we came into the hotel with pack backs and looking a bit dusty, but the customer service was absolutely chillingly frosty from the moment we stepped in to the moment we left. We have stayed in some excellent hotels in Asia, but this was worse than budget hotels anywhere else we have been. It was even stranger since we the rooms were still expensive even if not as expensive as the palace (well £200 per night) and yet we received much better and warmer hospitality from the owners of budget hotels (some were £8 per night).  The rooms themselves were unimpressive - the rooms had little character except for the nice bedding. The workmanship was poor. Someone else has"
"I stayed in the 2nd week of November on the behest of a family member who wanted the ""Taj"" experience. As the rooms and furnishings are nothing spectacular, you are paying a premium for their service. However it became quite clear that the premium service was only given to Westerners and celebrities.   We had attended for religious gathering, and despite being in Islamic attire, the hotel staff insisted of doing what I can assume was a poojah and placing a tika on our forehead. It took quite a forceful no from myself for them to not continue.   Breakfast had a service that was exceptioanl...until a westerner walked in. Twice my wife and myself were ignored in favour of another guest who had come after us. I even noticed that the waiters would go out of their way to personally"
the room was lovely although quite small.  Marble bathroom was great and spacious. Breakfasts were fantastic - it was lovely sat outside. Service was amazing in the hotel and all the restaurants.  The spa is a little hidden but we found it on the last day and had great treatments which were very good value! also great location and the hotel organised some great trips for us - you must do the slum tour!
"Whatever perceptions I had of India was all proofed wrong by my recent trip. What an amazing trip. Bombay best place with friendly people. Food fantastic.  So there traffic and not as clean but we looked beyond all that.  The ""slums"" is the place that showed me dedication and hard work with 100% commitment.  Will go back for sure. "
"The Rooms are spacious, & well planned, I was in the Palace Wing,   The welcoming into the hotel is something that needs to be complemented & i beleive all hotels should learn from this, You are not made to wait at the counter as you check in, but are rather taken to your room right away, & all paper work follows you into your Room.  All the Best Taj.  Only one disappointment on the breakfast table, The napkin that was served at the table was stained & when pointed out to the staff, the least they could do is apologise.   I feel embarrassed for the hotel's reputation as this is our 'Great Heritage hotel'."
"And this is one of them.  All I can say is this is hands down this is the best hotel I've ever stayed at in my life.   Plus it's location beats out the competitors in South Mumbai.   To everyone at the Taj Mahal, thanks for what you do it and how you do it.  You define customer service for the entire industry…and that makes every penny worth it.  Trust me."
"We spent 3 nights here en route back to the uk from Goa and were delighted with the hotel. We were very fortunate that our booking for the club heritage wing was upgraded to a fabulous suite - the Seagull with great views of the sunrise over the Arabian sea and the Gateway to India. The hotel is a stunning piece of architecture and is a delight to pass along its spectacular corridors and wonderful staircases. The suite was fabulous with a free standing bath, his and hers sinks and a separate lounge. The Club lounge provided lovely afternoon tea, cocktails and later a cognac and coffee slot. The staff were wonderful and daily we were given small momentos in our room such as a personalised bookmark, a velcro tie for my trailing mobile wire and delicious olives stuffed with chillis"
"The Hotel was good, breakfast good and we asked if we could use wifi. Of course she said, but when we checked out the next day, the charges were extra on the bill. The girl who showed us to the room did not mention that wifi was extra. Considering we paid nearly £250 per night for the room, it was just very petty to have to pay a few pounds for wifi! Most hotels even 2 star ones (or even zero star) include wifi free of charge! Wake up to the modern world Taj The other comment is the room in the old wing was very very small and we were on top of each other....at that price, I'm sure one can expect some more space..."
We stayed at the Taj from 18 to 20 Dec. everything went smoothly . Check in and out was just a few minutes. We asked for sea facing connecting rooms and there was no problems. Staff are friendly. Will be going back for a few days on 29 dec.
I overnight at the Taj Mahal Palace Hptel in Mumbai two week ago. The Hotel it self is really amazing with all the kind of services you would expect from this kind of Level. My room was in the Tower (cheaper version) some rooms are nice other rooms are better but nothing special. The Palace area of the hotel is the oldest and more expensive. But if your room is in the Tower you have access to all the other areas. The breakfast outside swimmingpool view is fantastic and the buffet offers a good selection of local delicacies. Gym open 24 hour and Spa great service. It's a good place where to spoil yuorself and the location is also good right in the city center.
"From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we couldn't have been made to feel more welcome. The service was fantastic and absolutely nothing was too much trouble. The hotel was absolutely immaculate and so beautiful, it was absolutely beautiful to just walk around the corridors and explore all the objects on display. Upon checking out our train didn't leave until that evening, we were informed that the hotel were more than happy for us to continue to use the facilities and were able to use the showers and changing rooms in the spa area free of charge. The location was great, we were able to walk to several of the sights from the hotel. I would highly recommend everyone to treat themselves to a stay here."
"This is not just a hotel. This is a piece of history! From the moment you step in from the heat and dust into the hotel lobby, you realise this is not just a hotel. The customer service is second to none. The simple fact that you dont really ""queue up"" to check in. Instead you wait in the exclusive lounge and sip your drink while the paper work is sorted. The princess lounge was just brilliant as well. The selection of teas was fantastic (Try the Darjeeling second flush). The staff, the hotel and the location - all add to the package which is hard to beat. There is a lot of hype around this hotel but it lives up to every bit of it!"
"I have been giving careful thought to this review because just about everyone loves this hotel, but I did not.  We were booked into the Tower Wing, not the Palace wing, so that might have made a difference. The Tower Wing is first and foremost a business hotel completely lacking in the welcome, comfort and service we had come to expect from the Taj.  When we got to the hotel the receptionist escorted us to our room, a Sea View double as booked, but it was a smoking room on a smoking floor and frankly smelled. Furthermore she insisted we had to stay there because the room had already been ""made up""  into a Hollywood double which is a King bed with two duvets!    Finally after a 10 minute discussion she called down to find us a non-smoking room in the same category with two beds"
"20 years ago as a backpacker in India I entered the hotel foyer and marvelled at its grandeur....  Now.... After a long wait I have been a guest. A very satisfied guest. We were very kindly upgraded  to a room overlooking the Gateway to India, which was a view we didn't tire of.  The public areas are absolutely superb, the breakfast selection very good and the location simply cannot be beaten.  Our experiences in the Golden Dragon and Masala Kraft weren't faultless, let down mostly by the service. But that didn't taint our stay in the hotel.  We spent 2 hours with the wonderfully talented gentleman who explained the history of the hotel and entertained us very well..... In a selection of languages! He was first class and this really added to our experience in the hotel.  We"
"My friends and I chose the Taj Mahal Palace as our FINAL indulgence for a stay in India.  Were we Disappointed? Not at all! Were we Spoiled? Absolutely!  The experience from start to finish was pure indulgence. Granted it is not cheap but the pure quality, decor, ambiance and service is unparalleled.  We stayed for 2 nights and I assure you it is well worth it!"
"Me and wife spent 24 hours in this hotel that has so much history attached to it and those 24 hours were like a dream! A welcome that made us feel special, the upgradation to a lovely room facing the swimming pool and impeccable service made us not want to leave this historical hotel. Every touch-point exudes the Taj flavour and you are guaranteed of great stay and experience. Dinner at Golden Dragon restaurant was amazing and even though the dishes were expensive by Indian standards, the food and flavour was worth every penny. Breakfast at Sea Lounge- a restaurant facing the Arabian sea was simple yet pleasurable (though waiting for seats made it a tad painful especially as we were made to rush as 10:30am the buffet shuts). All in all, you just cant miss this experience in your"
"Stunning swimming pool fuelled by lions, generously deep, atmospherically tropical, with upward view toward the turrets. Cosseting service from arrival as you parade garlanded to your room. Superb indian restaurant. One of the planets classic monuments. "
"Great historic hotel in a fantastic location! This hotel does a great job living up to its outstanding reputation. The property (we stayed in the original building), the staff and the food were all outstanding! The price for the room and food were very reasonable for what was provided!"
"This hotel will convince you that you really are royalty. It is extremely well located across from the Gateway to India monument, near the boat dock for Elephanta Island, and within a reasonable distance of the Museum. But it is the service and elegance (found throughout the hotel) that make it so special.  A treat that you will want to keep repeating."
One of the best hotels to be at the finest structure in the city if it's not this the its nothing the Mecca of all hotels in Mumbai. It has an amazing veiw from the top floor of the restaurant the apollo bunder the gateway of india. Nothing like being here.
"I was to attend a meeting being hosted at the Taj,so I took the opportunity to stay there.This decision was because I had stayed there some years ago in the much acclaimed Presidential suite,which was by default as they had run out of nonsmoking rooms - I had a blast then. This is a hotel with a long history of 100 years,in fact the TV has a dedicated channel giving you the history of the hotel and the famous guests who were here. In thee cent past it is sad story of 26/11 hostage situation that was so well handled by the staff of the hotel in helping several guests that made me stay here. The m was efficient,the staff extremely friendly and helpful . The rooms are good,so is the bed,the bathrooms are spacious. The food is excellent. The walk around the hotel is also very"
The Iconic Taj Hotel in Mumbai is without question one of the worlds great hotels a must visit - stay on the Club Floor so you can enjoy a beverage wjilst relaxing and overlooking the famous Gateway to India.
"If you like being treated as a VIP then a stay at the Taj Mahal Palace is a for you. From the moment that we arrived until our check-out we were felt like royalty. The whole experience from the well appointed rooms, room service and the concierge were excellent. It a trip from the airport but worth the experience. The food at every restaurant was five stars. The staff went out of their way to make you feel special."
After many visits to Bombay and also The taj for breakfast tea meals etc I decided to stay as a treat and also because I had recently read the book about the terrible attack on this venerable Old Bombay Institution I stayed in the old palace wing Full of exquisite grace taste and wonderful style The walk to the room up the stairs was even a pleasure The room was so comfortable and full of such marvellous furnishings obviously wonderfully caredfor and maintained It was like being a Maharani for a short time Marble bath fast hot shower Fluffy white towels etc etc I couldve sent the whole visit in this room The beautiful Sea Lounge or Shamiana for breafastwith a head spinning choice And such fine kind caring and individual sevice The Tour and History of this venerable Bombay
A great hotel with lots of history located next to the gateway to India which I think was constructed for the Queens visit to India. Far a business stay i suggest that you would only stay here if you are working in the emendate area as it takes about 1 hour to get to the airport or anywhere in that area. I can't fault the hotel everything is well maintained and the service is fantastic.
"The Taj Mahal palace is the epitome of culture, luxury and history when it comes to experience. It is located the southern most tip of the island city Mumbai and has the history of US presidents and many other celebrities staying over there.   The rooms are very very comfortable and the food is out of the world. We felt we came in the wrong season during our relocation so the weather played a spoil sport else the service, the hotel and the ambiance was top class. I must also admit that it was a guilty pleasure and getting to see some celebrities walking around the hotel on weekends and it was one off sites where they are not surrounded by mob.  The probable downside is that the food is mostly to western taste and thus not suited to my type.  Overall it may be slightly overpriced"
"We went there for a short trip (2 nights) and had a great time. The hotel has a great old school charm about it and you experience the moment you enter the property. The staff everywhere in the property is really courteous and makes you feel at home.  In addition to the property itself, it's location is unrivaled with it overlooking the Gateway Of India next to Marine Drive. Also, all the irani restraints (including Leopold cafe) in the back alley of Taj make it a wonderful experience to stay at Taj and explore the neighborhood."
Me and my husband stayed at this hotel in Dec 1st week. The rooms were clean but not luxurious.  The base category room in the palace wing didn't even have a bathtub!!  The welcome was very impressive and we thought it would be a very memorable stay. But was little disappointed with the services. The staff was not courteous at all. They didn't bother to wish you also if they happen to cross you any time. The breakfast was also very ok. Grapes were soon out of stock and only 1 live counter for vegetarians.  Overall I would say that they are charging too much for the services they offer. I would recommend The Oberoi or even Trident for that matter. The staff there is very very courteous and they go out of the way to help you and make your stay comfortable. Taj Mahal palace hotel
"We stayed here at this gorgeous hotel for three nights. It was the same time Prince Charles was in the hotel as well as the Indian and West Indies cricket teams were in house, so the hotel was a buzz of excitement . We stayed in the Palace wing of the hotel which was truly amazing and stately, just Devine. We used the facilities of the hotel and ate in the resturants and everything was first class. The two bars were a good place to start or finish you evening. Staff were well trained and attentive in all areas of the hotel from room attendants to resturant staff. Breakfast downstairs around the pool was very busy so we took to taking breakfast in the upstairs resturant and it was a very enjoyable way to start the day. Flowers were left I. The room with a small note from the duty"
"Got a good deal as ordinarily could not afford to stay here. Best hotel ever. The location is perfect, food is amazing and staff are incredibly helpful. Bed is the best I have slept on. Even met Prince Charles!"
"Must say I know nothing about Cricket, but stayed here two doors down from Sachin Tendulkar, one day after his last match - and I have the photo to prove it.  The next day I found a note left by somebody not so lucky on a hallway side table ""Dear Sachin, please come and bless my children - Room 308""  Hotel was great - really liked the High Tea and the chocolates.  Very entertaining 5pm hotel tour.    Glad I bought ""The Siege"" at the airport AFTER my stay and not before(!)"
"Stayed 3  nights in the taj last week,  Amazing historic hotel, wonderful bars , restaurants and the hospitality that taj has become famous for. The golden dragon restaurant had some of the best dim sum I have ever had, the duck also world class. Unsure about Mumbai, it's an interesting city for about 3 hours, too polluted and the sheer scale of poverty hits you, I understand that's India, but maybe it's not for me. The scale of rubbish is . The taj is worth a visit , but Mumbai, not for me"
"I'll make this simple. Food? Amazing buffet (the word buffet does this no justice) of Indian street food, plus a number of different foods. Then you get a platter of sweets and some amazing fresh tea. The best thing about this is the ridiculously inviting selection of desserts!! 4 tables stacked with petite, exceptionally tasty desserts. Including a wee chocolate fountain with strawberries to dip. All this for a very reasonable 1500 rupee? Just do it. Great service. Live pianist. Beautiful. And a nice surprise for a special someone too!"
"Yes indeed, if you get a chance, it's worth every penny. Stayed here for 5 nights and was given a 75m2 corner suite. Unfortunately the view of the suite was nothing to brag about - always try to get a sea-front facing room.  The services standards here are impeccable, although I'll still say the Oberoi's are a notch better, always. Remember - you here for that colonial experience, so enjoy it. The entire Palace (old) wing is a sight to behold and walk about.  The room interiors are full of character and very pleasant that you could spend the whole day without leaving the room or hotel premises. But very pricey....  One thing not to miss is the bookshop in the new wing."
Actually I admit that I did not stay in this hotel.   We were passing by and had heard from friends about the Hi-Tea service that they provide here so we stopped in on the way back from seeing the Gateway of India.  The tea room was very well designed and had incredible views over the Gateway and out to sea. The food was incredible and having gone for the buffet I was overwhelmed by the number of choices that were available as well as the very reasonable pricing! The staff were so pleasant and friendly and it was really a highlight of our trip!
"Writing this as we have our final hours of a two day stay in this excellent and famous hotel. Any quality hotel which gives a free upgrade without having been asked, is always going to be a winner with me. We were upgraded from the more modern tower wing to the traditional wing, and the bay fronted room we are in, is excellent with great views of The Gateway of India and the harbour. The staff are as you would expect very good but they don't have the natural warmth and amazing attentiveness of those in the Taj Bengal hotel in Kolkata, but as with the Taj Bengal they charge for wifi which I for one resent. We are about to indulge in High Tea in the Sea View Lounge which my wife tells me is outstanding value at around £15 for more than you can eat ! A great treat to round off a"
Charming colonial Hotel. I made the effort to stay here on my first trip to India even though it's location was fairly inconvenient for me. I am glad I made the effort as it really is a beautiful Hotel with stunning internal architecture. We were also excellently placed to make the most of the Ganesh festival celebrations. I ate in the Indian restaurant which I thought was pretty average but enjoyed my stay amidst the nostalgic grandeur. Highly recommended.
"Everything was excellent during both our recent two night stays there. We booked the rooms direct with the hotel and coordinated our transport from the airport using the service the hotel provides. Everything was confirmed by email and it was all organised and delivered very efficiently, with a high quality of transport. Makes getting to and from the hotel very easy and we felt that the price was fair for the benefit of not needing to negotiate for a taxi. Service from everyone we met at the hotel was impeccable. We suggest the Masala Kraft restaurant at the hotel for high quality Indian cuisine. There are lots of options; we tried the Tiffin style meals one night and the Sketch menu another night; would recommend both of these."
We have been fortunate enough to stay in some fantastic hotels but the Taj palace is right up at the top!...from the welcome to the pool to the food to the staff it all makes for a truly great experience..we stayed in the old part which I think is probably the better...ten out of ten!
Stayed here for a conference. The hotel is very charming and beautiful. The service is impeccable and food is great. I really enjoy Indian food and the Indian restaurant on the ground floor serves some fantastic Indian fare. Their chicken pilau rice is a must have.  It is located quite a distance away from the airport though so be sure to factor in sufficient traveling time.
"I visited this hotel twice in August with my grandmother. From the time we entered the hotel, we were treated like royalty. After being garlanded with beautiful jasmine flowers and a cup of tea in the opulent reception area we were escourted to the 14th floor which our room was on. The room was lovely with a comfortable bed and good view of the Gateway to India. The bathroom was a bit on the small side but that was no problem for us. After checking in we went out around the Colaba area. On returning, we found a gift for us with a card about the special relationship between a grandmother and grand daughter. We opened the present and it was a beautiful box of tea. What a thoughtful and kind gesture. On the first night that we stayed there we had an early flight the next morning."
Unbelievable views of Mumbai harbour. Suite was enormous. Breakfast fresh and great assortment. Walking distance to the nice shopping areas. Suite was not cheap but worth every penny! Nice swimming pool.
Overall excellent experience.  The service was fantastic and the staff were always willing to assist.  I was impressed with the waiters at breakfast who would make suggestions on the best way to eat certain traditional indian dishes. The hotel offers a daily tour of the building. I HIGHLY recommend it.!
"This was our first time staying at this hotel although we had visited on a previous trip to Mumbai. It is impossible to convey in this review just how impresses we were with our experience. Everything from the welcome through to checkout was absolutely first class. We were treated like royalty. The food in the 3 restaurants we sampled was outstanding, and all the staff were faultlessly attentive. We will definitely return. "
"Having stayed in the Palace and had a superb time, we returned and stayed in the Tower.  I wasn't expecting the same as the Palace, but it wasn't different enough to justify the price.  On leaving, I discovered that I had left a white cotton top hanging in the wardrobe.  Within hours we rang the Taj and told them, but were told that nothing had been found.  It was a $5 top that I'd bought in Cambodia, but I loved it.  All my praise for the Taj and the service of its staff is now overshadowed by this petty theft.  I felt very let down by the Taj."
wonderful setting. ask for a room in the old wing of the hotel and you'll travel back in time... pool is nice on a hot day and gym helps burn  the extra calories. located close to the Gate of India and to many silver shops you would want to buy everything from...
"For me it was just the best stay I ever had, the only minus was the cleanliness of the room that could be better for this kind of hotel. The rest was excellent! The breakfast close to the swimming pool, the room big and conformable and the price was ridiculous for the excellent service provided by the staff!"
"We spent half our time in Mumbai at the Palace, the other half at the Lands End. I loved the this hotel. We did stay in an executive suite in the Palace Wing so my expectations were very high...and they were exceeded.  Such a beautiful hotel with so much history.  Like the Imperial in Delhi it doesn't try to be a modern hotel with sleek lines and fancy rooms. If you want that stay at the Sofitel or Four Seasons. It is a grand hotel. Bathrooms were magnificent,  beds so comfortable. Staff were beyond accommodating.  The restaurants and all facilities exceptional (very expensive though). Location is perfect.  Though as I mentioned in my review of the Taj Lands End some time in Bandra is advised as well. So a wonderful stay. Enjoy"
We are have checked in the hotel on 20th of November 2013.We Have given Room No Called 567 at fifth floor at palace wings. The welcome wasn't good.But all foreigners especially the whites are Welcomed Well with Garlands.Even we booked the suite room at palace wing.Staffs here are Horrible.They want to help only whites not Indians or White.We went to an Restaurant at Taj  called Masala kraft we have pre booked the table for us from the room and again we have reconfirmed the table with the palace reception before we stepped into the restaurant.But when we stepped in the concierge named Hemalatha asked us to go out of the restaurant and wait us for other 20 minutes.Even though the tables are free.We asked the Valuable reasons for that but she refused to tell that.Then we have give
Stayed last week. Great location. Also great rooms. service. nice restaurants. Located near India Gate... Synagogue. museum of Modern Art. Seaside. Great for all types of people. Suggest to friends. I think best hotel in India.
Magnificent in every sense of the word! I will be back again..and again...and again! The Taj Palace had been on my wish list...and Ive stayed in many hotels throughout the world. Taj Palace is simply a MUST DO world class treat!
"We reached hotel at 4am, although we knew our check-in time is at 12 noon. Receptionist requested us to make ourself comfortable in lobby, as there were no room available in the room category we have booked. Later she took us around hotel for a heritage tour (just to pass our time). When they heard we have reached Mumbai after 22 hours flight, immediately they assigned us a room in Palace suite (around 6am). No doubt, the suite was best experience of our life, room service was excellent."
"Top notch service! The most attentive employees I have ever dealt with. World class beautiful hotel. The place should be a museum, I did not stay in the tower, but the rest of the hotel is magnificent. The pool is the perfect temperature. Treat yourself and stay here."
"No words can describe my experience at Taj. The place has gotten better and better over the years. The wonderful ambiance and great service makes it the greatest. I was working out in the gym and the attended kept looking at every simple need. He made such a difference in the level of service. Breakfast spread was simply amazing, really healthy fare with some great indulgence. Every employee greeted you very warmly making one feel soo welcomed. Keep it up Taj, I am your fan for life."
"Our second visit to the Taj in sucessive years, what an experience and pleasure to stay in such a place. I can think of no better way to end a journey to wonderful India than to spend some time in the Taj before departing. From the moment you step out of the car, the service and pampering starts. Our accommodation was in the Palace wing, so nice. Breakfast by the window overlooking the Gateway Of India and watching the world go by, what a way to start the day; two hours over breakfast isn't unreasonable don't you think. The service in the Taj is second to none, the attention to detail unsurpassed, restaurants delightful, especially the Souk, it is a must, put this place on your bucket list. Guys, do yourself a BIG favour, if you want to get some browny points, take your partner"
"We stayed here for a 2 night visit to Mumbai. Although our agent had booked us into the tower wing(which will be an ongoing dispute amongst others) we paid the extra to stay in the Palace. Our room on the 4th floor was  beautiful. It is worth paying for a sea/india gateway view and we spent a lot of time people watching (indian style) The immaculate bathroom must have recently been done and was just white marble and glass. The best shower ever. Lovely toiletries. The service was immaculate and the food good if quite highly priced but you must remember you are in one of the top hotels in the world.Staff were very friendly and helpful. The shops may be more expensive than outside but it is actually quite nice sometimes to be able to buy things without the mad, stressful pushiness"
"Stayed another night at Taj Palace. Though i will write a review this time atleast. Otherwise i wouldn't do justice to the consistent good experience i have there. This place is top-class, and treats you like royalty at every step. You can walk through history in the Heritage section of the Palace and the food is eclectic. Staff if extremely friendly and makes you feel at home. Had a great time overall"
Got a room on 14th floor with sea view. Even City View room has great view.   Rooms are very well furnished with selection of TV channels and minibar items. Bathroom was well stocked with plenty great quality accessories.   Dinner at Wasabi (Japanese) was fabulous and so was the service and recommendation by our server. Breakfast in bed quality was good but quantity was just about adequate for a light eater.
Definitely worth staying here to soak up all the history and famous characters that have passed through it's doors. The Chinese Restaurant was great but surprisingly the Indian one was very disappointing. Sea view rom is worth the premium for it.
I love this hotel and I hope i will visit again as the whole experience was truly magical from how were were picked up to the room to the service. We arrived hot at the airport and were met with 2 ice cold bottle of waters. On arrival we were whisked into the private executive lounge for check in tea and cake while the registration was done. This hotel is massive but having booked on the executive floor we had our own entrance reception etc. Our room overlooking the sea had a wow factor. It was large perfectly designed with pastel colours and great Indian embroidery throws. The bathroom was fabulous with a tv mirror throughly decadent. Rose petals were strewn into your bath water on request. Everything about this hotel and service was great and I cant wait to again
"The historical first five star hotel of India built for everyone against British “Dogs and Indian not allowed’ era the great Tata buit this grandeur in 1903. Guest have the choice of staying in the Palace wing or the Tower wing. We choose the Palace and had one of the best experience of our life. The Taj hospitality is crowing after the 26/11 attack and they look into your small requirements. Go stay there and encounter what India has to offer. The luxury, the people, the Gate of India and the Arabian Sea. Various restaurants at Taj Palace Mumbai are maticulously created to gourmet menu. Of which the Souk at the roof of the tower wing and the Chinese on the ground level is par excellence. India has two TAJ, one in Agra and the other in Mumbai."
"I stayed one night in Taj, one can enjoy view from Taj one side getway of india and another side sea view.luxury wise Taj is best as well hospitality is also good.Love to visit taj again but this time with my family"
"Pros/Likes: - Truly luxurious décor with a blend of Indian and Western motifs - Check-in and out were fast and efficient; received a welcome garland of flowers at check-in - Excellent location with restaurants, shops, and local attractions at walking distance - Original reservation at the Palace Wing with sea view was upgraded to the Club Room floor without me even asking - Butler service on each floor; my butler Jaspreet was fantastic, always very nice and attentive - Room was large and wonderful with a great bed and big-screen TV (with a third of channels in Indian languages) - Electrical outlets were multi-type (American, European, Asian) - Outstanding view of the sea and Gateway of India from my 6th floor room - Bathroom was large with both shower and bathtub and great"
"The hotel is located near India gate with nice views. Stayed there before and enjoyed our stay very much. The staff were fantastic and went out of their way to help us with everything - shopping tips, eating out etc.  Lost of shopping to do in Mumbai and we really enjoyed our stay."
"We stayed in this hotel during the lights festival a couple of year ago and it we loved it. The people, the environment, the breakfast and specially the nice view. It is one of the nicest hotels we have stayed. Our room was really nice with a spectacular view."
"The history, the beauty and the location make this the best choice in Mumbai.  The service is better at the Four Seasons but the location is not great so this hotel wins the top spot for us.  The remodel has made the hotel spectacular and you feel part of history staying here.  The rooms are unique and comfortable and the pool area is wonderful in the afternoon after a day in Mumbai.  The service was good and always willing to help and you are in the center of shopping and restaurant action so again this is the place to stay in Mumbai."
"the hotel interiors are just mind blowing..cant forget the good hospitality the staff offers.and the rooms are as relaxed and comfortable they can be..yes,price is on a higher side but thats worth all penny u spend..will recommend it to all.."
"My wife & I have just got back from 2 nights at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai. In many respects this is a superb hotel, the location is ideal right beside the Gateway to India, but without being picky we were a touch disappointed with a few aspects. Our room was in the Tower & it looked a bit tired with a small bathroom which we felt was not up to the standard we expected. Breakfast was a real disappointment, it was disorganised chaos, on our first day it took 10 minutes we get a table, and the choice of food at breakfast was not up to the standard we have had in other hotels. Much of the service in the Taj Mahal Palace was excellent, they let us stay in our room till 4pm without charge, they arranged a very good city tour at short notice, the food in the Indian Restaurant was"
taj service very nnice i like and food very good room service good for family and couples .................................................... all is fine i like i like and room A/C vvery good cooling and tv and fone all is excellent i like
"Though I hardly got time to explore this place, its obviously one of the most luxurious and exclusive hotels in the city. Right from the reception which has Hussain's paintings to the pool side with the old world fans on the high ceilings above, this place exudes luxury. There is a whole line of luxury stores attached to the hotel..so splurge no holds bar! The place also does a walkthrough everyday to give guests the history of the place. The downsides are the not too great rooms, and even if you have a view of the Gateway and the Mumbai sea (more like a big drain), the windows are heavily wired due to security (or pigeons perhaps), taking away the joy."
"Best hotel I have seen in my life is Taj Mahal palace and best hospitality, taj is taj , no one can beat them, they have the best service and food, also they know how to satisfy your need, don't miss it , just book in it and also if you want to fly to Mumbai use jet airways they are best"
"The Taj Mahal Palace delivers everything you would expect from a luxury class, heritage hotel. Every service you will possibly need and every creature comfort you may want is available. We stayed in the modern wing in a quite spacious room, very clean and well appointed. The staff were very well trained and very attentive. The restaurants are exclusive and the food world class with well informed and helpful waiters. The hotel itself is a magnificent building and the location iconic. Stay here and experience the luxury, but be prepared to pay a high price."
"Went to the Taj for lunch, fantastic tasting menu in cool, quiet splendour all with the Gateway to India as a view out of the window. Excellent service, the only thing that spoiled it was a number of ignorant people eating and using mobiles at the same time."
"Absolutely loved it. From the amazing view of the India Gateway (we stayed at the Tower) to the beautiful pool and the terrific service, this is as good as Indian luxury gets. Try to stay for more than one night, though. We had to leave the following day and felt like we missed plenty of things to do in the hotel (restaurants, fitness centre, etc), let alone Mumbai.  Don't forget to order the hotel's iconic drink at the Harbour bar. Magic!"
"A very fine hotel indeed. Spent 3 nights there last week as part of a regional team conference. Pool was excellent, service outstanding and food was absolutely amazing. The rooms are a little on the small side, but it is quite an old hotel and they are very well looked after. Really great place to stay in Bombay !"
Amazing food options. Golden Dragon (one of the restaurants) is very expensive but has the best Chinese I have ever eaten. THe hotel is right opposite Gateway of India which is a big tourist attractions. There is a lot of traffic at all odd hours around the area but once inside it is amazing. The pool is good.
"The outstanding service is what differentiates Taj Mahal Palace from the rest. Had a lovely stay and was really impressed by the professionalism and attentiveness of the staff from the time you step into the hotel.  I had a very unique experience as I arrived at the hotel on my birthday. Thank you to housekeeping for beautifully decorating my room during the day with flowers and balloons. Thank you to the Concierge for arranging for a birthday cake.  A big thank you also to Mrs. Sarita Singh, the restaurant manager, for  an unforgettable birthday dinner at the Souk restaurant and for the beautiful roses...it really made my day."
"This hotel is situated along Marine Road facing the Sea. A superb location though a tiresome journey from the airport it's well worth it. My wife and I were extremely happy here, the service is second to none, the choice and quality of food in the several restaurants is excellent, breakfast poolside in downtown Bombay who would have thought ?   The Marsala Kraft restaurant was our favorite and we even bought a tiffin box.  We stayed two nights after arriving early (7:45am) we were given breakfast and then shown to our room - extremely early check in thank you Taj. I would earnestly suggest a visit if you are in Bombay, sorry Mumbai, even the decor is exhilarating. The Salon is good too and reasonably priced.  The hotel tour at 5pm is superb with an entertaining walk round with"
"OK, five star hotels are almost always very good - this one takes it a bit further.   Here's one little example; we stayed for about a week, housekeeping noticed that we usually left fairly early in the morning,  came back mid afternoon for a shower and a change and then headed off again for the rest of the day. Four days in we went on a fairly long journey and didnt get back until early evening. When we got to the room,  there was a warm bath waiting, bubble bath and petals and so on. What a really nice touch and impressive that they noticed this level of detail.  That sums it all up, fantastic hotel.   Minor gripes,  you have to pay for wifi and the restaurants inside are fine but pretty expensive compared to any reaturant outside.  We paid a little extra and stayed in the"
"We stayed here for a night during my trip to Mumbai for wedding shopping and sightseeing. The first thing that comes to my mind about my stay in Taj is outstanding service. We were given an early check in and were escorted to the heritage room lounge while the check in formalities was completed.  An Aarti was taken and a tilak was placed on our foreheads as a nice touch, especially for forgein travellers.  (Tip: A picture can be taken here and given to guests as souveniers ) An excellent Gauva mocktail was served as complimentary drink which was thoughtful. We had a nice upgrade to the heritage wing with a city view. The view from the room was not the best.Sea view would have been much nicer but thats nitpicking.  The room itself was spacious and extremely comfortable with state"
"What more can I say? The Taj is a real 5-star luxury hotel, from top to bottom, the kind of hotel against which all top hotels should be measured. The rooms are spectacular, the service is flawless, the food is delicious, the entire hotel is immaculate, the halls sparkle, there's no better location. This is in the top three hotels I have stayed in in my life. It was a great pleasure to end our two weeks in India at this institution. I will always remember it. Perfection, truly."
"I enjoyed my stay at Taj Mahal hotel The service was very good The staff was very welcoming and nice Clean Room clean bathroom as well  The room service was fast and The food was Delicious.  The only two things i didn't love about the hotel was the 3G conection was so bad , and the maids was asking too much about the Cleaning and if im ok with their cleaning ! Whats so annoying about it that they ask more thank 3/2 times A DAY They even call from the reception if you tried to ignore a little but just to ask you if everything was ok    Personally i dont like to keep answering the door or the phone more than once when i try to Relax  Specially when its about the same Quotation !  Other than that the hotel is really good.      "
"Hotel Taj Lands end is located in CST with a sea facing view. The hotel is just adjacent to residences of couple of bollywood actors. The hotel is amazing with great rooms and great ambiance. The rooms are superb, service is awesome and food choices are amazing. This hotel truly is a luxurious place to stay in Mumbai and enjoy the Taj Hospitality!!"
"The building and rooms are stunning. It looks a world class luxury hotel. Some of the staff let it down though. Whilst most are great, there was disarray at the all-too-small breakfast room where people were kept waiting, and even the manager came to offer excuses. This is not the kind of hotel that should be offering excuses, the situations just shouldn't happen. I ordered some food from the bar, and it took a long time to come because chef wasn't happy. Well, I wasn't happy at being made to wait, but there was no free glass of champagne or anything else. The smoking section poolside needs the staff to pay more attention to it, as one can sit waiting to order for too long, and even resort to getting up to go find a waiter. However, these didn't make a huge dent in the overall"
"Visiting Mumbai we had to stay in the iconic Taj  Mahal Palace but our budget restricted us to the Tower wing. On arrival we were upgraded to the Taj Club room in the Palace / victorian wing which we were very grateful for. The Club room included a personal butler, a separate reception area, separate lift exclusive for palace residents only. This also included in the exclusive palace lounge afternoon tea and a buffet, chocolate and cognac and unlimited soft drinks throughout the day. Breakfast was in the Sea Lounge which was an amazing experience, the serenity of having your breakfast in such a beautiful room overlooking the Gateway of India. This is a opulent place with loads of history and lovely architecture. Tour of the palace takes place at 5pm each day which was very"
"Just like living in a Palace !  At all times it was wonderful walking in the front door of Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai . Everything is exceptional . The marble floors , deluxe  grandeur of magnificent  6 level staircase spiralling to the heavens , shining silver vases full of pink lillies , sweet lemon aromatherapy in the hallways , sparkling chandeliers and so many paintings ,serenity and lush grounds around the swimming pool , best ever delicous buffet breakfast in Shamiana , attentive exceptional  service  . Our room in the Palace Wing with Seaview was deluxe with marble bathroom . We travelled from Australia and this was the best place ever for my daughters birthday ! The welcome we  received was wonderful , flowers from a beautiful girl in sari , drinks in the library ,"
"The Taj Mahal is cult and that not only since the attacks in 2008. It is probably the best known hotel of india and one of the most famous in mumbai. It consists of two houses, the old main building and the newer high-rise building as annex. It is a five star -hotel with excellent. That means that one in short pants time inclined looked at will. Also you have to at the entrance once through the security check, which since the attacks is essential. The room was big and spacious and decorated with class. The staff was also very accomodating! In summary the hotel has lots of charm and history (good and bad). I can recommend it wasnt bad at all!"
Amazing Hotel. One of my favorite hotels in Bombay.. I love the location its walking distance from some amazing shopping in Colaba and also to some great bars and restaurants. Over looking the Bombay Harbor and the Gateway of India. Make sure u enjoy the evening tea at the Sea Lounge over locking the sea.
"I recently spent a weekend staying there for my anniversary. Even though I live in Mumbai, i decided to get my better half the gift she wanted. We stayed at the Old wing among all its grandeur. Though that we splurged and stayed in the more premium section, the new wing is also fabulous. The service is as one would normally expect form the Taj... perfect. The food is fantastic also. The view is stunning. Most worthy a stay in Mumbai!"
"They greet you like a celebrity, and the service is impeccable every step of the way from there.  Drinks were a bit expensive by the pool, but what else would you expect.  Some famous cricket teams were staying here at the same time, was funny to see all the groupies chasing them around."
"The traditional half of this hotel is iconic. One if the region's greats. That's where you need to stay.   The ""new"" half doesn't really have anything to mark it out.   The service was as to be expected (welcoming hosts at breakfast, impeccable manners for most, lost items returned) but perhaps not as attentive as Taj Lands End.  Poolside terrace restaurant was open for relaxed dining.   Bit of a surprise that the bar shuts at 1.30. Still, early to bed, early to rise...."
"This hotel lived up to its expectations. Service was exceptional and an upgrade is always a bonus. The views over the bay and the Gate of India were exceptional. The pool area was fabulous and the tour they arrange around the hotel to discuss its history was charming, thanks Viran. The memorial to the 2008 atrocities is very fitting. I would highly recommend this hotel for the experience and the history alone."
"great service, amazing staff, lovely view, spotless hotel! cant wait to go back there. I stayed in a standard room which was lovely. we ate breakfast in the sea lounge each morning which was lovely and peaceful. would recommend the masala lounge restaurant there too        "
"This is a real 5 star hotel as expected even on business or for leisure.Service,food and spa excellent.The rooms very clean with good comfort even a bit old looking (it's an old busy hotel)and during my stay a bit noisy unfortunately - it can happens... Overall very good  - up to it's standard"
"Don't get me wrong. This is a lovely hotel. Good service generally....although we had to remind them yo remove our empty plates from in-house dining although we had agreed they would come back in an hour to take them away.....came back from our sight-seeing tour and they were still in the room. Also we asked for them to reserve a table for us at wasabi, but they didn't. Not a problem though..we still got a table. We stayed in the palace part of the hotel. Seemed much nicer than the main lobby area. You can check in and out of the hotel in the privacy of your own room. Asked for extended check out and they happily obliged. Food on room service was very nice. Room was a bit on the small side (having just stayed in a much larger room at Rambagh) and view wasn't all that but we were"
"The Taj was absolutely exquisite. Can not fault a thing. With day spa, choice of 5 restaurants, pool & shopping we could have very easily not left hotel for the duration of our stay in Mumbai. The room was a little expensive & the restaurants western prices but was well worth every cent & a great place to end our 3 week Indian Adventure"
"My daughter and I spent two fabulous nights at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai. Service was excellent. Beautiful hotel overlooking the Indian Ocean. Situated by the gateway of India, very tight security. Stayed in the Palace wing with lounge access. Luxurious bathroom with all modern equipment. I was fascinated with the TV in the bathroom mirror. Bathroom all marble from floor to ceiling.  This Hotel has hosted many dignitaries including the president of the US, many famous movie stars and famous people.  Stay at many fine hotels before with premium amenities but the Taj Palace has a history and charm of its own. Had tour of hotel with Manager Viren D'sa very dramatic and educated young man. Great restaurants, beautiful lobby. Had dinner at the Indian restaurant our waiter was"
"This was a 1 night 'treat' for us to stay here as we had heard a lot about it.  The service here is good as expected from the Taj Group. Noticing we wore glasses and sending up someone with a cleaning cloth was a nice touch.  The treat itself is the hotel and the grounds.  The pool area is nice, with convenient smoking area.  Am surprised you have to pay extra for WiFi when it's even included at the Taj President!  The lobby smelled of orange blossom, divine and was spacious enough for us to while away hours wating for our travel connection."
"We have just returned from a lovely stay in a sea facing club room in the palace wing. Overall, this is a remarkable hotel and afforded us an exceptional time in Mumbai that we will remember for many years.  The palace building is beautiful.  The restaurants are superb.  The service offered by the staff is (in the main) exemplary. There were a couple of niggles with service that were disappointing (perhaps more so because the service at the sister hotel in Delhi had been flawless).  Nevertheless, we enjoyed our stay enormously and would recommend the hotel to all."
Absolutely amazing: the staff were so helpful/obliging/friendly. Great location and great service. Cocktails were expensive- the only flaw. This was a mother:daughter 3 day/2 night adventure- we loved it! Highly recommend to anyone who loves to feel 'special'
"Wonderful hotel, well worth the expense.  Comfortable, attentive staff, great views, superb food at its various restaurants. The Shamiana Restaurant offers a great buffet, and each table has its own ""butler"" who waits on you hand and foot."
"I had such a wonderful time at this hotel.  I spent two days here by myself before the start of a business trip.  My initial room was in the tower, but I was kept awake by the elevator and they moved me into the old Palace.  What a fabulous room, everything perfect and impeccable service.  I loved the tour of the old part of the hotel, the beautiful pool and I had a massage at the spa which was very nice.  The conceirge couldn't have been more helpful and arranged a half day tour for me as well as an excellent seafood dinner.  All together pampered, I would highly recommend it."
"Well very honestly I had heard a lot about this hotel and got a chance to stay at it during a conference. Need to say it wasn't as amazing as I had thought it would be. For one, the bedroom was about alright. The commotion thanks to a competing event was quite irritating - the hotel's capacity is clearly not enough to accommodate two events at one go. Lastly, parking is a big issue as the valets parked my car in one of the lanes and it came back with a few scratches."
"Hotels around the world should train their staff at this superb hotel. From the moment we arrived, our every need was anticipated and met. Service and attention to detail was magnificent. We have stayed in many places around the world, so don't make these comments lightly. It was our 30th wedding anniversary and we were given a delicious chocolate mousse cake and on our return from dinner our room had been decorated with red heart shaped balloons, towel swan art, rose petals and a heart shaped flower design on the floor. Huge thanks to Sandeep who made it all possible. A unique experience. If in Mumbai, stay at the Taj if you can!"
"After staying here previously and enjoying a great stay you are always a bit nervous whether or not the second stay will live up to expectations..............well I should not have been as the stay was as good if not better than the first. The staff are absolutely marvellous, extremely polite and helpful and that goes from the top down. We will certainly try to visit here again. try to stay in the Heritage part of the Hotel....it's superb."
"upon making a reservation i was asked to fill out arrival details. I answered truthfully that we would be celebrating my daughter's 5th birthday.   When we arrived we were accompanied to our room, which had been entirely decorated with balloons, garlands, flowers, presents, and towels folded in the shape of various animals. My daughter LOVED it and thanked me several times for choosing this hotel... we also received a personalized birthday cake... this was way beyond what i expected and it really made our weekend extra memorable.   We had a great time in the courtyard and enjoyed the pool. Everything was perfect.  Having stayed in the tower before, i booked a Palace room this time and i think that's the only way to go. Yes it's more expensive but it was totally worth it."
"I have stayed at hotels across the world, but the Taj at Mumbai is just a class apart. The service is faultless and the staff genuinely eager to please. Highly recommended. Their restaurants and spa should also be tried."
"Having stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace seven or eight times in the last two years I would confidently recommend this iconic hotel to any visitor to Mumbai.  It should be noted that there are two sections to this hotel as can be seen from viewing a photo of the hotel. The Palace Wing at the front of the hotel is the section to which I am referring. At the back of the hotel is a 'budget accommodation' concrete tower. This is a different experience altogether but is much cheaper.  For those staying in the Palace Wing, the experience will be one that will stay with you for many years. Yes, this is the hotel that made headlines with a terrorist atrocity several years ago. However, the entire hotel was painstakingly restored to its original glory and now boasts some of the most"
"I have stayed at both the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai and the Vivanta by Taj- MG Road in Bangalore. I have put these two hotels as joint equal for my favourite ever stay at a hotel, as I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, which was the best experience I had ever had in a hotel, with it's marvellous decor, facilities, charming staff, exquisite level of service, hospitality and attention to detail of the like I had not previously experienced. Having now stayed at Vivanta by Taj, MG Road, Bangalore, I have to rate my experience here equally as highly for the level of care I received and amount of enjoyment I experienced.   I spent several days at the Mumbai Taj Mahal Palace in late October/beginning of November last year, and had never had a stay anywhere like it. I had a"
"My family and I visited the Taj Mahal Palace after our trip to Paris. It was recommended by our friends and indeed it is a lovely hotel and a great place to stay. We stayed for five days and the service was great. Rooms are  spacious and comfortable. The décor in this establishment was beautiful. Food selection was great ,tasted fresh unlike processed taste you would get out of the frozen meats. The pool was much needed relief from Mumbai humid days that we are not used to. For those staying in this area, I would highly recommend staying here."
"No doubt this is an exceptional hotel. The hospitality is unforgettable, the staff extremely friendly and tentative. We were greeted by Ms Priyanka, who epitomised the spirit, culture and hospitality of Taj.   The hotel has all the facilities one would aspire from a five star hotel - gym, swimming pool, bar, restaurants, designer shops etc. The icing on our stay was when they presented our child with a surprise birthday cake.  Everyone here is very attentive, considerate and customer focussed, there was one senior gentlemen though who was supervising the person processing our payment, who seemed a bit grumpy and dismissive of our reservation with Booking.com.  Oberall we would say Taj is more than a hotel, it is a unique experience.   "
"Superb hotel and service -expensive but well worth every penny/rupee. Stayed in the palace wing for five nights last December. Our butler Adrian set the tone with polite, attentive service which was followed throughout the lounge and breakfast room. We will undoubtedly never stay in as good a hotel again-alas ( ( unless, of course we go back)"
The Taj is one of the best colonial hotels in Asia.  Its old world grandness  is well preserved. Service is impeccable. Food is excellent.  Rooms were spacious and well appointed.  The Library (or cigar room) is an excellent place for business meetings.  It is a luxe experience all around.
"Good place to stay. Old world charm in a modern setting.... The room are nice, cosy and comfortable, with a bright decor and some of the views are fantastic. The wi-fi connection is superior. The rooms are quiet and the service excellent."
"This hotel is a landmark and has huge emotional memories . For college students , shoppers in that area its a must dropin for a snack or a place to celebrate. The service is excellent and full of old world charm. Just sit back and and let the world go by....Its location right by the sea the food is fantastic.. i can hardly of any drawback except the price which r back breaking for a college student but i would recommend at least a visit ..mandatory"
Stayed here last year during christmas. Beautifully decorated lobby. Nice service. Old world charm. But a bit dated. Very crowded lobby. Shopping arcade is nice. Rooms are ok. nEed refurbishment. Nice view of the sea. Good breakfast spread.
"My stay was cut in half - thanks Air India, master of flight cancellations - so it was regrettably brief.  Lovely upper floor room with beautiful view out to the Gateway to India.  As others have noted, Hotel security is indeed disciplined but with the history being what it is, I don't fault the hotel one bit for that.  Particular kudos to the guy at the pool who was unfailingly prompt with fresh towels and iced water.  A bastion of peace that almost shuts out Mumbai's national anthem, the car horn.  Good work also by the ground floor Indian restaurant and to Souk, the Lebanese restaurant, with its excellent views and knowledgeable, hospitable staff."
"Stayed for a week - used their business conference rooms - great service!  Concierge helped me book internal flights around India, under pressure.    Great service by the pool, great staff always making you feel welcome.  Would recommend!"
Traveling through India can be difficult sometimes regarding your accommodations but this hotel is always a relief to arrive in.   Apart from a cumbersome security set up at the entrance everything else is perfect. World class hotel. 
"loved every moment spent in this property, had great time off with my family. kids were all over the place and enjoyed every bit of it. lovely place for a family vacation. rooms remind you of the times of maharajas mixed with luxury of the 21st century. staff is very courteous and helpfull, lovely ambiance and proximity to gateway of india are a sure attraction."
The Taj Mahal Palace by far is the best in Mumbai with its high standards of service and hospitality.  My father is a member of their rewards club - The Epicure Plus by which we get a free stay at any of the Taj hotels in Mumbai.  I have stayed here twice & have been reassured by the service delivered by its staff that it is the most prestigious hotel where one feels pampered and at home.The detailing that they take care of even whiles cleaning your room is an eye opener.  I live in Mumbai itself and we usually use the free night as a weekend getaway.  I can't wait to stay here again !
"this was my first visit to taj group of hotels and was a bon voyage! the rooms are great especially sea side view. the main building is better than new block! service was great and we felt as if truly a king! the old building is an architectural marvel and really a palace!! the food was sumptuous and worth value, the best restaurant i ever visited!!"
"Like always, loved the stay! This was the first Taj hotel in India, where the story began - an interesting one too and worth hearing from a proud employee there. I travel a fair bit, but the warmth of service is extraordinary here. And the service is always good. This holds true for almost all Taj properties we have stayed at. Back to this Taj and its location. The main sightseeing spot of Mumbai, Gateway, right across the road! Rooms facing the city may face a slight bit of sound issue, as windows are not necessarily fully sound proof. And Mumbai can be ""slightly"" noisy! To counter that, the pool really is the place to sit and ponder over yourself. A real oasis. On another tangent, some of the best eating places are all around, provided you can tear yourself away from what the"
"Quite simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The warmth of the welcome from all members of staff, the quality of the food, the extra attention to detail, the sheer beauty of the decor and the comfortable beds and quality linens continuously delighted us during our 3 day stay. Don't miss the complimentary tour of the hotel each afternoon. The concierge and all the reception team are so knowledgable and helpful. We just want to say a huge thank you."
"This hotel defines service. You already know it is in the prime location overlooking the Gateway to India. There is of course high security at every step and the food in the restaurants is exceptional. Kraft Masala is of course amazing. But, what you may not know is the high level of service you get at every turn. Let me start by saying that Satish Gaikwad is by far away the best concierge I have come across in my many travels and stays. He not only books tours for you but follows up with genuine questions and concerns if you are not satisfied. He went way out of his way to make my daughter feel welcome with a special box of tea and we were always looking forward to seeing his smiling face when we returned. We were not 100% happy with our Be Local tour of Dharavi and he had a"
Didn't stay a night here but visited this hotel's pub and restaurant twice. Got a chance to check this hotel during the visit to the restautant. Staff are very friendly and the interior of the hotel is exceptional.
"Luxurious stay in Mumbai. Good spread of breakfast and excellent restaurants and food. One actually feels, that we are entering history while walking into the Hotel. The staff that stays up to the image and pride of Taj. Lots of places around in walking distances and very convenient. I really enjoyed my stay in this property which is also the face of Taj hotels!"
I stayed at Palace section of the Hotel which gives me a wonderful feeling of rich taste and culture. Reception and lobby is grand and staff are very polite and courteous. Ambience of the Room is very Good. Room is very cosy and comfortable and loaded with accessories. The panoramic view of The Gateway of India from the Room is wonderful. I enjoyed the evening at the Restaurant and tasted the lovely food. Restaurant was well decorated and lighted and gives a very elegant  and enchanting feeling.They have many varieties of Tea and pastries. The Hotel is also centrally located.   Overall my stay at this Hotel was very memorable.
"Me and my partner were on a tight budget travelling through India. However, given the iconic nature and location of this hotel we decided to splash out and spend the money. I can honestly say it was worth every cent!!   -Upon arrival we were immediately upgraded to a deluxe room with a balcony that looked directly down onto the gateway of India.  -Breakfast wasn't included in our room rate, but we decided to have it anyway. When we went to pay, the restaurant manager said not to worry about it and gave it to us complementary.   -The phone line went down briefly (which we didn't even realise) due to a storm. The next day the guest service manager personally came to our room, apologised and gave us a complementary bottle of wine and flowers. This made us feel very welcome and"
We stayed at the palace wing and it was an amazing experience . Staff is excellent helpful and polite. They have the best of the restaurants . They have an evening guided tour of the hotel should not be missed it has wonderful things to know about the hotel. They have lovely selection of teas and the pastry shop is fantastic. The buffet lunch on a Saturday was lovely and the spread of items were a lot and good quality stuff worth the price.
Taj Heritage.... exceptionally good hotel. I spent a very good time with my friends and family there. the night life is really awsome in the bar. The staff is very polite and co-operative. I have very vivid memories of that horrible incident that took place in this beautiful hotel in 2006. But the hotel and staff has come up strong and shining since then. every room that was involved in that attack has been renovated and furnished beautifully.
"Loved this hotel! From the moment I walked into the hotel everyone was incredibly polite and gave amazing customer service.   I was allowed to check in around 10am and upgraded for free by a lovely receptionist.   I stayed in a palace room rather than the tower - amaxing history.   The room was wonderful and had a view of the gateway of india...   I can't say enough good things about this hotel.   Staff, room, serivce, pool, decor, cleanliness, food, drinks - everything is amaxing - this is a 6* hotel for sure!!!!!!!!"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is everything you would expect it to be: attentive, courteous, friendly, pro-active staff, good rooms (though smallish and not overly impressive, but with very good amenities like real coffee instead of instant in the room), beautiful setting thick with atmosphere. It is a true oasis and safe haven in bustling Mumbai (though quite a shock when you step outside). The staff didn't even lose their cools with my two children running around. Breakfast  in the tea room was quite a disappointment (slow service, variety of food offered rather dull) but it does come with a view of Gateway of india (within a few meters). The Palace Wing is definitely recommendable (comes with free access to the lounges and breakfast). So is the hotel tour at 5pm every afternoon. Good"
"With charming staff trying too hard to please this potentially wonderful hotel has forgotten some basics which lead to a sense of it being overpriced and lacking value for money. Every cough, sneeze and excitable telephone conversation from the room next door could be easily heard through paper-thin walls. Over anxious service staff want to do so many things for you, most of which are not needed and turn out to be irritations. Restaurant service is good but the food is variable in some of the main restaurants. One thing is certain - the prices are close to European level. I suspect I expected too much from this flag ship hotel. Unlikely to visit again."
"I'd stayed at this hotel for a week when I traveled to Mumbai on business. This place is the best of all the places that I've stayed so far, especially due to the best hospitality that they provide. The staff here are very professional, cordial and wonderful. I must mention a situation here which took my respect to this hotel several notches above. One of the days that I've stayed here happened to be Ganesh Chaturthi (a hindu festival). Right from the morning thru the evening of the day, thanks to my busy schedule, I was very disappointed that I couldn't catch a glimpse of Lord Ganesha. In the night, at 11 PM when I walk into the room, I find a little well-decorated Ganesh (made out of towel) on the reading table. I don't even remember mentioning to the staff about my"
"We lived in Mumbai a long, long time ago (before the attacks). This was a refuge in a world of confusion and, well, confusion.  Some things go back to the British and it shows - but that and the indian twist is the charm, isnt it?  Anyway, we enjoyed it. The pool is great, the rooms can be a bit pokey but all in all, if you can afford it, do it."
"We stayed here for only one night at the start of our tour in India and we weren't disappointed.  We splashed out on a executive suite in the Palace Wing which although expensive was well worth the money.  From start to finish we were treated very well despite our rucksacks and obvious travel holdall!   Everyone was very polite and attentive but not overly intrusive; a hard balance to reach I guess.   The suite was beautiful spotlessly clean and spacious with two bathrooms to chose from! Fresh fruit, nibbles, fresh flowers and endless supply of fresh water were lovely touches that we loved.   We ate in Masala Craft restaurant which was lovely. The breakfast in the Sea Lounge was great all topped with a seat at the window to enjoy the Gateway to India! Special mention must go to"
Stayed in the hotel for two nights. The service was excellent. Was brought to the waiting lounge while we waited to be checked in and offered drinks. It instantly made us feel welcomed. The room didn't disappoint. It looks very grand. The view of the Arabian Sea from the breakfast area was absolutely breathtaking no words can describe. Location is good very near to the Gateway of India. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Would totally recommend this hotel.
"This is a fantastic hotel in Mumbai. Great location right on the water. The breakfasts are very good, the security was unbelievable. I would recommend to stay in the old wing, it's so quiet. The only slight negative is due to the sheer size of this hotel it is a little impersonal. The service is excellent and I would be more than happy to stay here again. "
"After so many time there, I still feel well when chosing the Taj Mahal, with its atmosphed in the middle of tradition and modern comfort. I would add that opposite to the main entrance you have the ancient the Gate of India, always crowded. Good room service, pleasant indoor restaurants, eventhough not the best ones in Mumbai (still, I prefer to call it Bombay)."
First let me say don't let the past sway you from staying in this hotel.  Security today is top notch--the most serious yet polite I've seen anywhere.  A beautiful hotel with superb staff; I believe every floor has its own butler to help guests.  I was on a business trip and had to work all day; I told a person at the front desk I needed something from the pharmacy and the staff picked it up for me and had it waiting in my room when I returned from work that evening; they only charged me the cost of the medicine.  The Indian restaurant is disappointing but the Sea Lounge is very nice.
"Everything about this hotel was perfect. From pickup at the airport, through check in and check out, everything was as I would expect from a top hotel such as this. The room was incredibly comfortable, with a wonderful view of India Gate. The staff was incredibly friendly and extremely helpful. The guy who cleaned our room cleaned it beyond our expectations. It wasn't just clean, it was immaculate. We were here for a couple of nights. I've been to Mumbai a number of times, but typically stayed near the airport. This was the first time I'd stayed further away; the front desk staff was very helpful. There were some particular things that we were looking for, and the staff helped us locate them. All around, this was a perfect stay. I couldn't have asked for better treatment and a"
"One of the best hotels we visited. Lots of attending stuff, beatiful design and comfort. The swimming pool is amazing, breakfast in front of the sea and the India-Gate is worth every rupee. Didn't try the restaurants but there are a few restaurants that look promising. wi Fi is not free but also not too expensive."
I was on a  business tour to Mumbai for 3 nights and 4 days. This would have been my 35th or 36th stay with The Taj Mahal Palace including my long stays (3 or 4 weeks) at a stretch. The check-in has always been prompt and same has the check out been. The hotel meets all my comfort and luxury expectations. The food has been awesome. Same is the breakfast spread which is quite wide and a lot to choose from. The staff has always been helpful and courteous. I have never seen a hotel across the globe which has a very low attrition in the staff and every morning the way they greet you makes your day. Here you get the TAJ sleep (The best and the most comfortable sleep). If budget and time permits I would recommend this hotel for everyone to stay at least once and have an experience of
"This was a really nice experience. I was there on business so my expectations were more focused around a good breakfast, nice bed and a decent location. I was blown away by the hospitality and helpfulness of the staff. The hotel was the site of the bombings from a few years back, I wouldn't let that detour you. The security detail is very strong. Nothing to worry about!"
I spent three nights in a Deluxe King Room (which is not the cheapest room type). I was really shocked by the poor quality of the hotel in all aspects. Just have a look on the pics I added and you will know why. I really wonder how such a bad hotel can obtain such good reviews as there are much better hotels in Mumbai. People seem to be blinded by the name of the hotel. I don't know about the room in the Palace Wing - but if you stay in the Tower Wing don't expect much more than in a 2 star hotel and be prepared to treated as a backpacker.  THE FEW PROS ARE: - location - breakfast is not bad - older staff at breakfast very friendly (but younger staff not trained and rude) - swimming pool - room service was efficient  BUT THERE ARE SO MANY CONS: - security problem: they scan you
"A short celebration which was taken care off in a way much more than you can expect by one of the best hotel's in India. The room in the palace/heritage wing was superb with beautiful walls, excellent flooring. The service was perfect, so were the amenities. The poolside lobby/sit out has an amazing charm and the evening rain and thunderstorm made it more beautiful The heritage wing color coordinated passage and old world furniture on all floors along with grand stairs and the gigantic dome in the center are a sight which will take you to an another era The food at Shamiana and Golden Dragon was delicious as ever."
"From what I've seen, there isn't a hotel like this in the world.  Treat yourself and upgrade to the heritage wing, where you'll be greeted by a traditional Hindi welcome ceremony with fresh flowers and incense. Then it's to your incredible room - high ceilings, marble galore, a bed with a different postcode for each side. It's perfect!  The staff were excellent - (Dinesh G at brekkie made it his personal mission for me to try every blend of Massala tea on the menu), friendly, nothing was too much and attentive.  Personal highlights were breakfasts - and sitting overlooking the sea, Gate of India with your amazing brew - the smell (fresh flowers EVERYWHERE) and sights around the hotel. Whether it was David Cameron's convoy of millions (I kid you not - lockdown a la hotel) or Mr"
"After two nights at the Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur my expectations may have been raised to an unrealistic level.  So the Taj Mahal Palace was a disappointing experience.  During our two weeks traveling by car through Rajasthan we have stayed at some outstanding heritage hotels, the Lake Palace being the most noteworthy.  We have become accustomed to an exceptional level of service and attention in beautifully curated, intimate environments.  The Taj Palace is the antithesis.  The lobby--huge, modern and tastelessly decorated--has the ambiance of the waiting room in a train station.  The endless corridors accessing the rooms on the upper floors have surprisingly low ceiling that remind one of a 1960's apartment building.  The rooms were of a decent size and comfortable enough,"
"We arrived crack of dawn in Mumbai to discover there was no transport from hotel waiting for us, not impressed. However, one phone call to hotel and their amazing service levels swung into action. Soon we were surrounded by helpers and whisked away to luxury.  We received an upgrade for our taxi troubles, fabulously opulent room with immaculate modern bathroom. Everything about this hotel is fabulous. Manicure and pedicure easy to book in spa and husband loved the outdoor pool. Bottled water appeared next to you at all times, free of charge. Lovely restaurant area next to the pool for light snacks. Lots of different types restaurants in hotel if you want to eat in. Also easy access to other eating places close by. The poverty outside hotel is difficult to handle but that's"
"My close friends from UK, Leslie & Alan, were visiting Mumbai for a holiday trip and the only hotel they were really interested in staying was the Taj Mahal Palace.  They had read so much about it ...being a regular reader of reviews posted on Trip Advisor.  Though the location was quite far from Khar yet they preferred to stay there.  However, it was one of the best places we selected.  We loved catching up on old memories at their room facing the Arabian Sea.  It was closer to visiting places like the Elephanta Caves, Kala Ghoda, the Museum, etc. Leisurely walks at the Gateway was a delight. However the best attraction was the hotel itself and my friends had a good 1/2 day sightseeing the lovely architecture, the old and new layout....the ambience, the food, the friendly"
"The staff are freakishly friendly, helpful and professional. They made me feel like a queen. They upgraded me to a palace room from the tower and its the most beautiful hotel ive ever stayed in. Gobsmacked. Great food. Incredible staff!"
"My wife and I have just stayed at the hotel which was our first two days of a 16 day tour of India. What a wonderful experience. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left, the staff at the hotel from top to bottom provided a level of service unsurpassed by any of the many top hotels we have stayed in around the world. The service appears effortless, testimony to the high standards of training and supervision at every level. Our room was in the Palace Wing with breathtaking views of India Gate and we could not fault the cleanliness, room facilities or services which were a phone call away and impeccably provided no matter what the request. Breakfast in The Sea Lounge was an absolute pleasure thanks to a fantastic team whilst our dinners in both Masala Kraft and The Golden"
"Taj is always a first priority when you plan either a business trip or a family holiday or just want to spend some class time with your better half... the hospitality the cuisine, just spending some quality time by the ""pool side"" or a dinner at ""The Shamiana"" over a pudina prawn and some french wine..."
"stayed at the Taj for 2 days! The rooms are awesome, the food was so good! They have 5 different restaurants, a starbuck, and one of the best sushi chef.  The staff is really kind and polite. The price is reasonable for an hotel of that standard. The most amazing thing is that the spa (Jiva Spa), the prices are really affordable, the choices are incredible! From ~ 10 different choices of yoga styles, the team is really professional. I just have to say one thing! Try it! And it is surrounding by the colaba causeway market, the famous restaurant Leopold, museum, librairies, lots of thai spas, the architecture is fabulous. Recommend to each and evry traveler to Mumbai"
"Without doubt one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. From the welcome, to the service, the grand breakfast to the staff the accolades afforded to this institution has been well earned. The staff are so well trained that they make you feel so at home without fawning all over you. They know when to engage you and then when to magically disengage with you. This skill extends to one and all from the top managers down to those at the coal face. I have stayed at a few well heeled hotels but have never encountered this kind of treatment. An example is when you walk in to the Sea Lounge for a meal whether it is breakfast or High Tea the staff make you welcome, sit you down, make sure you are comfortable before asking for your room number. The Heritage tour is well worth the"
"I stayed here for (hold your breath) 4 months with my wife, when we were in the process of moving to India and looking for a home.  Not one day were we made to feel anything less than special!  Everyone - right from the doorman, to the housekeeping staff, was absolutely fantastic.  I have stayed in great hotels across the world, but noone beats this hotel when it comes to hospitality.  A special commendation for Madhuri and her team in the housekeeping dept.  She made sure my wife was pampered, our anniversaries/b'days were remembered and rooms decorated accordingly, brought in a dehumidifier into the room to prevent our stuff being ruined by the Mumbai humidity...and I can keep going on.  Bottomline, we felt special and at home.  The restaurant staff was fantastic too. My only"
"The arrival itself suggested that I was due for an experience much different from any of my previous stays anywhere..  Right from check in, late at night to the check out, I would always cherish the memories of my stay at this magnificent hotel.  Details were impeccable, rooms-comfortable, service-proficient and staff-efficient and personalised.  The long breakfast break along poolside view and relaxing evenings at the bar were great.  Will love to be visiting again."
"We were very lucky to stumble on this at the last minute. We able to book the room for 3 weeks. March 2012.  We were welcomed into the hotel very uniquely. Totally the Great Indian Welcome with the Thali (Plate with the candle and the Garland). Not forgetting the welcome drink. When we reach our room the view of the Arabian Sea and the Gateway of India was something out of my imagination. The Staff was excellent in providing for us, The Wi-Fi for my IPAD and a direct connection for my laptop. The room was well decorated and the toilet was fantastic. The staff would arrange a milk bath with rose petals thrown over the bubble. Truly makes you feel ROYAL. The breakfast had a variety of cuisine. Some of wish are made on the spot.. Totally worth it. Location was great super near to"
"Everything from the arrival to the checkout has been top notch and is at par with the best in the world. If service and promptness is what you are lookign for it just doesnt get any better than this,  globally.  On arrival, you are received by a manager who takes you directly to the room where you have the reception formalities arranged for you. No dealing with the reception desk etc. The food in room service is excellent. The neighbourhood is also quite nice and is ideal if you want to take a stroll during evening. The famous Cafe Leopold is also quite close."
"This time I got a very good room opposite the Gate Way of India. The room had been recently redone probably. I got E&Y good service. I had only one problem; though the hotel is in the centre of a major metro, the 3G connectivity of two major telcom service providers was very weak-  I have different numbers from two telecoms, one   for my iPad and the other for my  iPhone. Throughout my stay, the problem remained. I wanted to avoid taking WiFi from the hotel. The rooms are very spacious, extremely clean and well maintained. Had good food for the breakfast and lunch, though the sambar accompanying idlli/ wad, left scope for lot of improvement."
"The Taj Mahal Palace hotel is really beautiful and magnificient. I especially liked my swim at the swimming pool in the morning , surrounded by this historical building it feels like I have been taken a century back in time. The staff was very eager to help and very efficient. The restaurants also served great food - although I haven't tried the Chinese restaurant, I was told the food is one of the best Chinese restaurant in town so I will be trying that next time I am on business travel in Mumbai."
"I Stayed in this hotel last week 27-29 Aug and it was a wonderful experience the place, Staff and everything was so pleasant and my family enjoyed their first visit to Mumbai. will be here again and recommend all to stay there to feel the history of this place"
"Pretty much perfection.  Loads of freebies, little touches, etc.  Stay in the heritage side and take the historical tour.  Service unmatchable.  Nothing was a hassle.  The only downside is that there isn't much in the way of a happening hotel bar scene here.  For that, I went to the Four Seasons."
Stayed 2 nights in the Taj with friends in August. Splashed out at the start of our Indian adventure and were not disappointed. Service from all staff was out of this world and cocktails in the Harbour bar were unforgettable. The signature cocktail is an experience in itself. Would completely recommend this as a must for anyone travelling to Mumbai. The concierge slice was second to none. They looked after our every need and were extremely helpful in recommending sightseeing.
"The hotel is a very well locatedand excellently maintained hotel. The rooms are spacious and well furnished with all required facilities. The buffet breakfast is well spread. Tastewise, talking of Indian food, it needs improvement. The bell desk service is very slow and needs improvement. ve"
"Am basically a budget traveller who believes in spending as less as possible for a bed. But, I felt like pampering myself for once and so booked a room for 2 nights at the Taj. From the beginning to the end, service was at its utmost. The ever- ready to please staff, the quality of room service, the quantity of condiments. I could probably go on. Don't forget to do the heritage tour at 5pm. The Taj is truly an experience "
"I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of last year for business. I was upgraded to the Palace side and can truly say it is the best hotel i have ever stayed in globally.   The service in all areas of the hotel from the many restaurants through to the pool and spa area were top notch, afternoon tea should not be missed.   The room i was in was very large and ornate and the turn down service was impeccable, different animals made of towels left on the bed each night were amazing creations. Natasha Mirajkar one of the guest relations managers was very professional and helped with any requests.  I have finally persuaded my wife to make the trip out to Mumbai for Christmas this year and i have just booked on the Palace side of the hotel with a sea view room. For business i travel 2"
"This would have to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in . Iwould rate it above 5 star.  I stayed for 4 nights, The Hotel staff were attentive and didn't miss a beat. They noticed that I had earrings and left some on my pillow. A small gift was left each day The attended to the room twicw a day and nothing was too much trouble. I had a room  that overlooking the Gate of India. Great Decor, great food selections. Great location. I will definately be going back."
"I stayed here for 1 night while in Mumbai for work. I had a room on the 3rd floor of the heritage wing (368). I had a partial view of the ocean but mainly looked out to the concrete side of the Tower, which wasn't so appealing. The renovated room was comfortable and well designed. You could tell a lot of attention went into the design of the furniture (such as the great chest of drawers with a marble top where your suitcase was placed) and the lighting (everything was on dimmer).  The only downside was that during the monsoon season, even with AC blasting, the room felt quite damp and very humid."
"This palace (I would prefer calling it so) is simply amazing. It is truly a world heritage hotel. The chandeliers, wooden works and everything thing is just awesome. Though the hotel is expensive, it is truly worth it. I simply couldn't believe the long history of this hotel until I saw the photos taken decades ago. The buffets were amazing."
"This was our last stop in Mumbai before heading back to the UK the following day. There is nothing better than taking a stroll from the GateWay of India to this magnificent hotel and taking  a late afternoon tea. This hotel just drips in sheer elegance & opulence . Sipping a nice fresh brew of Darjeeling overlooking the Arabian Sea while the pianist plays in the back ground. This is the life.  Next time we visit Mumbai , will look to sure book a couple of nights at this hotel ."
"This is such a memorable hotel, with all its history and amazing location. The garden and the pool are beautiful. The spa is excellent, and the breakfast is the best ever. The summum of Indian hospitality!"
"This hotel is simply stunning. I honestly can't fault a thing, from the impeccable service through to the truly international buffet breakfast (with the broadest range of choice I have ever been presented with) they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable, relaxed and special. If I return to Mumbai, there is nowhere else I'd want to stay!"
Stayed for one night at the end of travelling in south India.  The service was excellent really warm and welcoming. The best hotel I have stayed at.  Would recommend to all. They even let us return after checkout to use the spa to clean up before the journey home.
"First the good points-For a brand like TAJ 11000(incl tax and breakfast was not a bad deal).Location is superb.The ambience of the hotel is also very good and the best part was that we were upgraded to Palace and we were given early checkin and late checkout.BUT our luggage came after 4 hours of checking in our room,the butler service was bad,the room lock and key was terrible,variety in breakfast was very limited though sea lounge and staff was great. The spa was the worst part of the Hotel.GYM in basement was very suffocating with bad equipment and the sauna and steam room were like pigeonholes. Swimming pool was also very uncomfortable.At last it was like chennnai express 3 star doing great business."
"As I'm a gold epicure plus member, we got a complimentary night stay at this majestic hotel, it was fantastic . Right from the reception desk to housekeeping they took every care to see that we enjoyed it. The hotel upgraded us to the palace room which was so lovely with a pvt butler service. We also ordered in room dining which was served in style a la taj.the housekeeping also arranged for an extra bed as we just had a king bed and I asked them to do this since we had our 2 children with us. Moreover Shamiana also made our breakfast complimentary . Amazing hospitality from an amazing group.even the welcome was traditional with garlands. They make u feel special, will go back soon"
"Had one of my best business stays and would love to go back again and again! Thank you for your unparalleled hospitality Taj!   Pros: (1) Incredible hospitality by staff - very polite, extremely helpful and always make you feel at ease (2) Plush !! (3) Amazing view of India Gate and the sea - waking up to this view on every morning of my stay was instantly rejuvenating (4) Great food  Cons: Wi-fi is no longer a luxury item - was disappointed that it still is for an upscale hotel like Taj Palace and Towers !! the complementary wi-fi at the buffet breakfast hall was patchy at best. For business travelers internet connection at all points in time is more than necessary  - hope the management would take this into consideration.  Overall - highly recommended stay!"
"From my earlier stays at other Taj properties and knowing the historic significance of this property, I knew the moment i stepped in I couldn't ask for anything but luxury, comfort and customer centricity with a smile. Since I was there for a TATA group event and was driving, the hotel gladly took in my car for two days and took very good care of it. Stayed at the 12th floor overlooking the Gateway. All events were spectacularly organized and will it be as most Tata Group heads were there.   As a guest, must try the Aquaruis pool side breakfast dining, it was by far the best breakfast speads and a much relaxing one at that.   Try catching up at a restaurant, lounge on the heritage wing- its old world charming  Kudos to the team, and keep up the great work"
"Really a stunning hotel, amazing facilities and customer service was second to none! and  we loved our stay here. Our whole stay went without a hitch and the staff couldn't have been nicer. Stayed august  2013,My stay there in this hotel was par excellence. The staff were excellent and their service was wonderful. Location was good and would definitely stay again."
"What a stunning hotel, amazing facilities and customer service was second to none! Location is fab, we loved our stay here. Only downside is the cost but you definitely get what you pay for here. Our whole stay went without a hitch and the staff couldn't have been nicer. Would definitely return."
"Everything good you've heard about the Taj Mahal Palace is true.  From the high thread count linen to the welcome greeting from front desk and your own butler to the bed turning service and cuisine. It's all worth it for $300.00 if only for one night of your life. Special mention to front desk and concierge (Glen Menezes) who facilitated my move to Taj Lands End in Bandra West where the small shops, Cafes and restaurants in Pali attracted me. The Taj Palace is the place to take your special someone on a romantic getaway. I went to Mumbai just for Taj and it was all worth it. It is the epitome of grand hotels.(note that the Palace Rooms are where you ought to stay as the Tower Rooms are just like any other good 5 star rooms. The Palace Rooms I consider 7 star even without the"
"We Checked in on Saturday 11th August, 2013. My wife was very apprehensive when we were getting there. You see we are very simple people and staying at Taj is a very big deal for a lot of people. But she was floored by their service. When we got there right from the door step the experience called Taj began. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. They treated us as if they had no other guest except us. They truly make you feel royal. Taj is expensive, but the love they give you, makes it worth it."
"This hotel is is grand, it has a long history, and the service of its employees is perfect. Almost everyone we met went over and beyond what is expected of them to make us feel comfortable, welcomed, and pampered. If we had a problem, the hotel made it more than right for us. Even if you only get to spend one night there, it's worth it and it's an experience.   Suggestions: 1) Have breakfast outside by the pool (you can fill your plate from the buffet and still sit outside). 2) Avoid the 19th floor- it's a little muggy during the monsoon season and smoke from the floor below creeps up (the 15th floor is perfect and nonsmoking).  3) Have tea in the lounge which was once the art museum. They have a good selection of teas, the fresh cookies they offer are delicious, and it's all"
"Amazing place to stay, loved it all. Great staff, good food, very good views of ocean and of course the architecture . I would recommend staying in ocean view side in the heritage building and also take the palace tour. It was a great view of the Gateway"
"Last time I stayed at the Taj was in 1993 when I spent 10 weeks on a journey though India. Staying here you can well understand why the hotel is the haunt of the cities glitterati, and the best icon of the city's affluence, blending Rajput, Renaissance, and Gothic architecture.  Jamshetji Nusserwanji Tata constructed the hotel in 1903 largely as a reaction to the British colonial rulers who barred Indians from using their clubs. The Taj opened their doors to everyone. Just steps from the Taj is the famous gateway to India overlooking the original docks. My room was one of the Palace Suites—the Palace wing has been completely restored by four of the world’s most acclaimed designers. I adore the palace corridors. For me they stand testimony to the Hotel's old heritage, with"
Nothing goes wrong if you choose  Taj Palace - vacation or business ! the  kids (and wife) love the pool and the shopping  area is Next to the hotel  and all kind of resturants are  available   inside the hotel or  close to the Hotel.
"I stayed three days at the Taj in Mumbai for business and it's an experience I'll never forget. The architecture of the building and view of the Gateway of India aare amazing. Make sure to take the palace tour which happens every day at 5. You'll get to see the grand staircase as well as the memorial for the people who lost their lives during the 26/11 terrorist attacks.  The staff was extremely nice, helpful and courteous. The rooms were very nice and clean, though I could have used more plugs for all my computers, ipads, phones, etc :)  I ate at a few of the restaurants while there - Souk, Golden Dragon, Shamiana and Wasabi. Also had coffee a few times in the Apollo Lounge. Enjoyed the fact they had coffees from around the world you could get in a french press.  Souk had the"
Great architecture and a wonderful hotel in many ways - very luxurious with super usually large rooms. Some of the bathrooms are very big and breathtaking to experience....This palace hotel measures up to all of these and then sum. It may be one of the best hotels in terms of service we have ever stayed at. If you want a great room with a view try--room 306 a suite we are currently in that has all the ammenities. As for India--the people are great dont fret just book your trip to the land of princes.
"The Taj was awesomely epic. From its charming staff to its fluorescent swimming pool, and great views, the Taj tops all. There are nice shops in the lobby and great restaurants. The breakfast at Sea Lounge, High Tea at the Palace Lounge, the swimming pool, and the tour of the hotel were my favorite things to do."
"I stayed at theTaj Hotel for 4 days! The rooms are really nice, the food was so good! They have 5 different restaurants, a starbuck, the best sushi chef is working as well there. There are many shops in the hotel from fashion designer Sarres, Louis V, books and cd's store, jewellery. The staff is really kind( a bit too much sometimes...). The price is ok for an hotel of that standard. The most amazing thing is that the spa (Jiva Spa), the prices are really affordable, the choices are incredible! From ~ 10 different choices of yoga styles, the team is really professional. I just have to say one thing! Try it! And it is surrounding by the colaba causeway market, the famous restaurant Leopold, museum, librairies, lots of thai spas, the architecture is fabulous. PS: Sorry for my"
"its one of the oldest hotels of mumbai and is yet has its own charm the pool is beautiful and well kept. the staff goes all out to help the guests which is a delite in todays day and age. the coffee shop has good and reasonable food. even there chinese retsurant "" golden dragon "" has excellent food. the rooms are yet well maintained and spacious.the view from the rooms towards the sea is beautiful and one can spend the whole day just seeing this view.  excellent experience."
"Staying at the Palace was absolutely amazing!  The service is unbeatable and the staff will go above and beyond to ensure that you have the best stay possible. This is what makes the biggest impact and why I would also suggest people stay here. The rooms are very comfortable and nicely appointed. The restaurants are plentiful with amazing food, if not a bit over priced. The High Tea was lovely overlooking the Gateway. The facilities are great too, nice pool, spa and gym area, plus loads of shops on the ground floor. Definitely worth the money to stay"
"I stayed in monsoon period on weekend for two days in the Tower Sea View Room,overlooking the gateway of India. Hotel staff is very friendly and they really take care of you very well. This personal touch is what differentiates my Taj experience from other 5 star hotels. Rooms are good but nothing great to differentiate from other hotels in this category. The breakfast was good in shamiana (restaurant)."
I read that the dream of Mr Tata was to build a hotel so fine that any person could walk into it and feel like a king: he succeeded. This is truly one of the finest hotel experiences in the world. Stay a night and experience its magic. Stay more and risk never being able to stay anywhere else. This is a little slice of Mumbai magic and is not to be missed. Make sure you stay in the original block (not the tower) if you want to get the real experience.
"the hotel is an icon for Mumbai city, and it lives up to the status of an icon... we stayed in a standard room with ocean/ gateway of India view.  We had a smooth check-in,  the room was done up well with little special decoration for my husband's birthday.   We were there on a weekend so had done prior reservation for Golden Dragon, in spite of which we had to wait for our table. The food was good and service exceptional.  Be ready to share your space with couple of celebrities there."
"Beautiful hotel on the seafront in Mumbai, a classic property with beautiful architecture.  It's vast and detailed and quite lovely.  I was there during monsoon season so can't speak to the pool, but enjoyed the hotel immensely."
"Taj does it again. They create a façade with bricks and mortar around a core belief of making fans of everyone who touches them. You enter the Hotel and feel the air getting lighter, the atmosphere relaxed and that's when the magic starts of making a fool out of you. Making you feel like you own them.....no.....like you are family.   They practice mind-reading and understand body language....Hmmm wonder why would they predict and plan for things that are not told. When you are tired and tensed, they come with freebies for a very relaxing bath. Or ask the butler to prepare drinks for you or bring the ""soft pillow"" on a platter. Or just chat sweet nothings to get the plans out of your mind, relax you, and then pamper you with a smile.   I have always appreciated the royalty this"
"There are hotels, and then there are hotels. When I was a poor college student many eons ago, I used to daydream of walking in the hallowed halls of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and spend a night there. Years after, I finally had a chance of staying here while on a business trip. And all my expectations harboured for years were obviously rather high – each and every one of them were met and perhaps exceeded.  I have stayed across various hotel properties in the world but this is one experience I will never ever forget. The Taj Group should consider offering 6 sigma certification courses in hospitality to other hotel chains – it was that incredible an experience. From the warm welcome to the room (I stayed in the new wing) with lovely old world furniture (I had a quaint wooden"
"From arrival to departure, and 3 wonderful days in between, this iconic hotel is an architectural masterpiece. The furniture/ furnishings and interior design made me tingle with each new discovery & the service was an art form. From every angle and every view this was the most stunning 'palace' and I'll dream of coming back one day. Thank you Adrian and Gomes for making my stay so special."
"This one hotel has been a landmark in Mumbai for people to visit ever since it was built. Right next to the Gateway of India. I have had the experience of staying at both the old wing and the towers and both of them can not be compared. I would however recommend the old wing rooms for the decor and ambience. You will not find any thing come close to this in India. Fabulous. The hospitality and service is the best, and will surpass your expectations. If you however wish to stay at the towers, try the sea facing rooms."
"what an experience staying in this hotel. the food serving is excellent I never seen this type of service, food also awesome , Number one royalty hotel in Mumbai, sea view coffee shop also super. this hotel for High grade people"
"The hotel has the historical wing for the leisure travelers and the new wing catered to business travelers mostly. It is a majestic hotel. For the decor, the hotel has kept, mostly, its original interior or a good replica of it from 100 years ago. For people looking for a modern chic hotel with all its glamour, this might not be suitable. The beautiful chandeliers, heavy carpets, old elevators, wood panels all over, long corridors will surely take you back to the times of the 20th century Maharajas. The hotel has signs of the 2006 massacres and the reception area service is fantastic. We had booked the 2nd floor conference room and the view from there of the Ocean and the Gateway of India was excellent. The buffet breakfast was good but I have had much better in much lesser"
"What an experience staying in this hotel. The aura and the history attached with this hotel add to the experience. Stayed here for 2 nights - separate occasions in the same month. Loved everything about the hotel - the view from the window, the rooms, the bed, the staff, the food, the decor, the serenity, the people...everything. Recommended for anyone who want to taste the best of Indian hospitality."
We felt like royalty from the start at this hotel.  The staff was very attentive and courteous.  The surroundings were spectacular and the history was amazing.  It was a special experience.  The location was central and easy navigate.
"I stayed at the Taj Palace Hotel in April 2012 and lived like a princess.  The quality of service and level of professionalism by the staff is unsurpassed by any hotel I have stayed during my travels. I had a day and evening butler.  When I returned from my trip to Elephanta Island (an hour boat-ride from the hotel); I was met by the courteous staff; ready to serve.  Upon arrival, I was met by the staff and escorted to my room.  The room was filled with flowers, wine, and petals, that give off the the sweetest scent.  The marbled foyer to my room, and decor was something out of a movie.  I had a view of the Gateway to India. Because I was on a Club floor, buffet breakfast, high tea, and cocktails were included.  It is more than worth it!  Perfection.  I have memories of my stay"
"We stayed here for 1 night in the palace wing. The room was beautiful. There were tiny touches here and there which made the stay all the more special than that at other hotels. The cleanliness level was very high. Sometimes in hotels even though the room looks clean, upon closer inspection you notice the dirt and dust in some corners, etc, but here everything was spic-span. The only negative I can point out (which is really a minor thing) is that one of the milk had gone bad in one of the sachets in the coffee tray. Other than that the stay was excellent, one of the best hotels I've stayed at in a while."
"When our large family group stepped out of the black hotel cars and into the air conditioned, lemony smelling reception of the Taj, Apollo Bunder, Mumbai, I did for a moment think that I was descended from royalty. The rose petals and dhiyas and bowing had me.....until we were asked to present passports and credit cards! But what a beautiful building, furnished impeccably, down to the floral arrangements and scent burners. The rooms do not disappoint, nor does the buffet breakfast. The service was excellent all round. I would happily stay there again."
"I had been in Taj Hotel last 7 days before. I love this hotel because of the quality services and well mannered employees wins your heart. Love to be there when in Mumbai. I recommend this hotel to every traveller because of Quality service, Cleanliness, Supporting staffs and well rooms."
"After our four month exhausting trip around India this was our last and final stop and what an experience.  World class.  From when we arrived, the welcome was professional but warm, through to the friendly staff, stunning room overlooking the City.  Can't fault it."
"The Taj is now my favourite hotel. Yes, it was suitably located with very clean rooms (in my case thanks to Anita and Arun), comfortable beds, delicious food, incredibly friendly and helpful staff (like Viren and Priyanka).   What made the experience stand out was the attention paid to the little things specific to me. I loved using the phone and being addressed by my name, instead of a random ""Hello M'am"". Gifts on the first night accompanied by an animal-folded towel were much appreciated. But you stole my heart with your Taj bookmark for the book I had left on my bedside table and the gorgeous bouquet of red roses - unforgettable!!!   I hear a bicycle tour is in the makings - something else to look forward to.   Well worth another stay!"
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel was fantastic. We spent 5 nights there for our honeymoon and the staff were highly attentive and approachable. We were even greeted by a gorgeous celebratory cake and balloons in our room on our arrival (at 2am!). Breakfast was superb. The small patisserie on the ground floor was perfect for getting some lunch, and most evenings we ate outside by the pool. This hotel was an oasis of calm within the hustle and bustle of Mumbai, and the well-staffed pool was the perfect place to go after a day of sightseeing. There there was no shortage of complimentary chilled bottled water and towels, and every so often the waiter would bring freshly prepared fruit and cold facecloths. Thank you to all at the Taj for ensuring that our honeymoon was an unforgettable one."
"If you want to treat yourself or anyone to a nice stay in Mumbai, I recommend this hotel. There are other fancy hotels in Mumbai for sure, but the Taj is in a great location for tourists - walking distance to the famous Leopold cafe, Colaba Causeway, Gateway of India etc. Plus if you miss starbucks, there's one in the hotel too.   All the staff are extremely friendly and kind and go to great lengths to deliver a service beyond your expectations. Stay in the Palace wing if you have the chance because the architecture is grand and very charming. You'll definitely get a heritage feel in the Palace wing compared to the Tower wing. If you're ever in need of any help while staying here, any staff would be more than happy to attend to your needs. If you're sick you can tell them and"
"We went with friends with families took 5 rooms on club floor  it was awesome experience, specially this is the place where you realize the difference between a 5 star and TAJ  I would call it TAJ EXPERIENCE We keep it as Bench mark, Par Excellence highly satisfied with Service/Cleanliness/security/quick response really so nice regards Praveen."
"This place though may seem grand from the pictures but to my awe, it was not that Grand. I have visited and stayed in Taj Palaces that are grander so this one was not upto my expectations. The lobby was small indeed which disappointedme again. It was not even comparable to Gateway Hotel Agra or Taj Mahal Delhi.  Now the staff was not that polite everywhere. At some places like in the Shamiana, the Gymnasium, Tower Wing Lobby but the staff in Palace wing lobby like the guard, the servers near the pool were rude asking again and again for my room no.   The food was average. I was expecting a great culinary experience at such a grand place. But only the breakfast in the Shamiana appealed my senses very much.  The food at Masala Kraft was poor, not that delicious or tasty.   The"
"If you want to take a break from your hustly bustly activities and city life, you are at right place which is in city but away from the city nuisance.  The ambience is mystical, cooperative and well mannered staff, awesome food, mindblowing facilities of pool, gym, massage.  Its like the world under one roof."
"This is one of the worlds great hotels. It has the history and the best guide to show it to you on your free hotel tour. This hotel is all about service and style and it has it all. All the staff are attentive and notice things. The extras in the room included impregnated clothes to clean your spectacles, facial hydration spray, sun cream, a little pack drawstring bag with colourful bracelets, behinds, hair clips and other Indian novelties and velcro to tidy up your laptop and phone chargers. One example of style and service was when I ordered a glass of wine to the room and the butler in a turban and white gloves brought a whole bottle on ice on a sliver tray with a bowl of stuffed olives and served me a glass at my table while I was watching the world go by around the gateway"
The experience was very unique as I want to specifically mention the restaurant which was overlooking the Arabian sea. its so interesting and the food is awesome. overall the hotel experiences was great. the yacht ride was extraordinary it all depends on how much you want to spend on your excursions.overall the vibrant colors and the spices were breath taking.
The heritage wing of The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai is a masterpiece. The renovated rooms are a mix of old heritage architecture and modern contemporary interiors. Food in the hotel is a wide choice of different cuisines. Heritage wing is a bit expensive but its worth it.
"Stayed in the Tower Wing on a recent business trip. While overall I had a good and comfortable stay, cannot really fault anything, there was still something missing. Maybe it is a case of high initial expectations but for one I did not find the room anything too special. It was small, dark and depressing. Maybe the weather made it like that. I asked for an upgrade (had written beforehand to Ms. Mona Singh who had assured me that they would try their best, and even had a voucher) but wasn't given one though some of my colleagues who were repeat visitors were upgraded. I was told (somewhat haughtily) that upgrade to the Palace would be ""near impossible"". Some of my colleagues were upgraded to sea facing rooms in the Tower Wing while some (who probably did not ask) were not even"
"Luxurious yet not too formal, just the way I like it.  From a very friendly and efficient check in [at 11:30 am with no waiting], to the baggage porter who snipped off the airport security fasteners and airline tags to rooms being made up early morning - it was the small things that made the difference. And as chef Marco Pierre White says ""Perfection is lots of little things done well.” What you will not find are smart TVs, Bose audio dock for your iPhone, AirPlay printers and the other tech comforts of home. And I really wish they would make the wifi complimentary."
The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is an absolutely magnificent hotel to stay in. The attention to detail of the decor matches the attention given to the guests. The level of customer service is beyond that I have experienced at any other 5 star hotel I have stayed at.  The only minor detail that you should be prepared for is the time taken to travel elsewhere in Mumbai as this Taj is located at the southern most tip of the city. However the drivers provided by the Taj - at an extra cost of course - are experienced drivers and are able to safely transport you along the roads which are changed from 3 to 6 lanes at the will of other drivers.  Overall a fabulous experience.
"The title of this review may seem a little odd but it is based on the fact that the Taj is really 2 hotels in one. There is the tower wing (where I have only stayed once) where the rooms are more like a Holiday Inn than a 5 star luxury hotel. Then there is the palace wing (where I have been fortunate enough to stay over 10 times) which is what I am reviewing here.   Regardless of where you stay you will still get the Taj service which is second to none. Having stayed at luxury hotels all over the world, I can say that the service at the Taj is superb and some of the best I have ever experienced. The staff here really go out of their way to help and it's the small touches/gestures that really make a difference.  The rooms in the palace wing are beautifully done following a full"
By far the best property I have ever stayed. The staff could not have been more accommodating. I stayed in a Tower Room on a Deluxe Floor. The breakfast was superb - the fresh croissants were my favorite. Hotel had plenty of shops/stores on the ground level. Didn't eat in any of the restaurants except the Shamiana or the Patisserie for lunch. I just can't say enough about how wonderful my stay was.
"The Taj hotel is a beautiful oasis in busy Bombay with a great view of the Gateway to India and the Arabian Sea.  We arrived around 1am after 30+ hours of travel.  The Taj driver was waiting for us at the airport exit and a Taj rep found us and made sure we were happy.  We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by a team as we got out of the car.  The customer relations man bypassed registration and led us directly to our room on the Tower side.  The bellboy (their term not ours) arrived with our luggage within a few minutes.  They ordered us tea and cookies, which came promptly.  The room service man remembered what we liked and brought extra cookies each time we ordered tea.  The room was nice but not special with a view of the sea.  In the morning we had breakfast in the"
"One of my favorite hotels. I rate it as one of the best hotels over all, if not the best !. It has a different charm and aura around it. the service is top class and the breakfast outstanding. Located opp the India Gate and with in walking distance of  good shopping  and restaurants. The old block is a palace which has been converted to a very prestigious hotel."
"From the moment we arrived we knew we were in for a very special stay. Everything was absolutely perfect, and the service was impeccable. We were lucky enough to be celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary, and the staff did everything that they could and more to make the 4 day stay a truly memorable experience.  We stayed in an executive suite on the 3rd floor (376 I think!) which had a balcony looking over the pool area which was accessed from the bathroom. Every detail was thought about in the suite, and then some, and we had access to the Palace Lounge where the staff were extremely helpful and very kind.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying there, and we would like to thank the staff for an amazing experience."
"Have stayed a number of times this year and has been consistently great. Great setting, great restaurants and truly good service. Worth the price. recommend Breakfast at the Sea Lounge, kebabs at Masala Kraft and Chinese at Golden Dragon.The only niggle at times is the air conditioning."
"We stayed for one night at the Taj Palace in the Heritage wing and suffice to say our stay was outstanding! The rooms have been done up post the attacks and they are sperbly furnished. Luxurious and incredibly comfortable.   The service is of top quality and one can avail of the lounge facilities if you are staying in the Heritage wing. The club floor rooms can avail of happy hours and chocolates and Coignac which was a very nice touch.  The hotel has a great view and great location. Excellent for business and for leisure especially since it has a massive pool, spa and other recreational facilities.  Do try the Heritage walk which happens at 5 pm every day and gives a little background and history of the hotel."
"Stayed at the Taj Mumbai on a weekend in april,13. Had booked a standard room but was upgraded to a Palace room even without asking for it, so the stay started on a brilliant note. The Palace rooms are superb( my 1st stay in the Palace Wing).Lunch at the Coffee shop was lovely.The staff and service  was overall excellent specially the Lady at Checkin. We stay in Mumbai itself but have stayed at the Taj on weekends a couple of times before and love the experience, so we keep going back."
"From the moment you first walk into the Taj Palace to the point of your departure you will be exposed to some of the hospitality industries best service. So many other hotels could learn by following the Taj's example, after all, good service costs nothing!!  I stayed  in the Tower and could have no complaints about any aspect of the hotel, my only issue was that my work schedule kept me from enjoying more time in the hotel or indeed even trying out any of the restaurants!!"
"We have stayed only one night, but it has been perfect from the beginning til the end ! We had a such nice room, and better than expected, as we have been upgrated. Therefore, we had the breakfast included :) Staff is really helpful and very professional ! As we had our plane very late, we could stay longer in the room and enjoyed the swimming pool till the end ! "
My roman friend & i tried this place for evening coffee & for small luxury & it was breathtaking palace .everything is super classic .Sea lounge is restro located inside the hotel with view of arabian sea & gateway of India . In future i will be back to stay here for sure . All the best !!!]  See you in near future
Lets get straight to the point. If you really want to enjoy the true magic of this landmark hotel book a palace wing room.  The palace wing is the only way you'll really get to see the amazing historic interior. Even if you want the view still don't bother with the tower - you get all the great views from the restaurants anyway.  But it is not just the building that makes this one of the worlds greatest hotels. It is the superb personalised service. Within a day the staff will know your name and it really make an effort to ensure your stay is enjoyable.  All in all if you can afford it (and at these prices it's a big if!) go for it!
"I stayed in the old wing. I was in fact upgraded. The room was immaculate, quiet and clean. The bed was comfortable. The service faultless. The hotel has a wealth of character. I will go back.   I loved breakfast in the Sea Lounge. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous. I used the gym and swimming pool. The pool is wonderful. Lunch on the verandah was fabulous.   This a five star hotel in every way. I could not fault the place."
"My sister and I stayed in March 2013 - my second time at this hotel, her first. Right from when we walked through the door we were treated superbly. We were upgraded to the heritage wing and treated like royalty throughout our 3 day stay.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Food was great (room service seafood pizza was a real treat!).  Pool is beautiful.  Overall a really great hotel, with a great location.  I can't wait to go back there on my next Indian adventure!"
"This beautiful palace, which is a luxury hotel and probabaly, one of the best in the world, is worth a visit, even if one cannot afford to stay there.  The royal feeling is very obvious and such a gem of architecture cannot be missed, whilst in Mumbai."
"I went with my girlfriend on a 12 day south India trip for my birthday. Mumbai and the Taj was our first stop. I would say it was about 2:00 in the morning when we arrived from our international flight (by prepaid Taxi). What a contradiction it is when you enter the ""high security"" gates of the Taj after a 1hour drive through the streets of Mumbai where countless people are sleeping on the dirty pavement. After the security-check, (unlike the airport you just have to walk through the metaldetector, absolutely no patting down, never had to open a bag) we were welcomed very warmly in the impressive lobby. The friendly receptionist would walk us through everything we needed and showed us our Superior-Tower-room on the 17th floor. The room itself was rather small and the furniture"
"Lot has been said about the architecture, location, service, heritage about this hotel. So not gonna bore you further but share my experience in their not-so-oft written about Sea Lounge restaurant & even more exclusive signature Spa.  Nothing is quite as regal and nostalgic as a lazy mid-afternoon high tea at the Sea Lounge http://goo.gl/dcrkt. This place is steeped in history, offers an exquisite view over the Gateway of India & indeed has the most delectable finger-food, petit fours,etc.  Get a table by the panoramic window. Do ask for the mushroom vol-en-vents (they don't feature on the menu anymore - but they indulge their old patrons). Enjoy the piano music. Watch out for that tempting dessert cart as it makes the rounds. And to capture your moment - a photographer is"
"Spent one night here on a business trip. I stayed in the main old part of the hotel. The whole experience was superb. We had a buffet lunch with the business group I was in out with, on a large balcony area and the food was really nice. The pool, bar, reception and shared areas of the hotel were a pleasure to be in. If you get the chance you should stay here."
We didn't stay at the hotel but we did eat at the sea lounge and had drinks at the harbor bar. The food at the sea lounge was excellent. We had the buffet which was amazing! Tons of different desserts! The harbor bar was a bit over priced for drinks but the environment was worth the extra rupees. Both restaurants had a full view of the ocean and the Indian Gate. The hotel itself was absolutely stunning and we wish we would have stayed there!!
"We had a two night stay at the Taj Palace Hotel and we were upgraded to the Palace itself.  It is a great shame that whoever trains the staff at this hotel do not train the staff at every top hotel.  Every employee that we encountered could not do enough for you without being obsequious in any way.  Their attention to detail is unbelievable - we found book marks put in all our books!  Wonderful rooms, restaurants  - if you like Ginger - they serve an amazing Ginger cocktail in one of the bars.  Gorgeous pool area with attentive staff offering fresh fruit skewers, cold flannels and so on.    Breakfast in the Sea Lounge is a tremendous start to the day.  On our second visit our name was remembered and our seating, hot drink preferences etc which is just incredible as so many"
"Stayed in Taj Mahal on business (I work for a TATA Group company) and got upgraded from the Tower to the Palace. Have to agree with other reviews: This is easily the best hotel I have stayed in ever, and I have travelled quiet a lot on business over the years.  The reception, lobby, pool area, many restaurants and Palace rooms are just beautiful. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous (and plentiful) and will go out of their way to help you. Just one small example: I left my phone charger plugged in during the day, and when I can back house keeping had tied it back with a little complementary Velcro-strip!  Five star rating all the way!"
"First about the property.  Staying in this hotel and that also the heritage wing is like living through history.   My experience of Taj experience started right from the airport pick up. The transfer service was perfect and my check in process was smooth which was done in few minutes. My suggestion is when a guest is checking for the first time it would be nice to give information about the hotel. Like where is the breakfast served. Where are the restaurants. Serving time etc etc.  The room which i stayed was perfect(clean, fresh and spacious...particularly a very comfortable bed)....house keeping is also perfect. Particularly Ms Singh the head of house keeping was helpful and thorough professional in her service. One thing though, i did not understand the concept of butler"
"This beautiful hotel, which was the terrible scene of a terrorist attack in 2008, is now fully restored and opened.  Seeing this former palace is an experience unto itself.  Wonderful staff, accommodations, restaurants. Beautiful floral arrangements throughout.Not to be missed, if in Mumbai (Bombay)."
"We kept the best for last on our India trip and were not disappointed. The Taj Mahal Palace was beautiful and the facilities and service superb. We stayed in the Tower with a sea view room. On arrival we were met as we got out of our taxi and escorted to the reception desk. Check in was swift and then we were greeted with flower necklaces and welcomed to the Taj Mahal. All made us feel a bit special. Then up to our room, number 1104, on the eleventh floor where we were given a run through of facilities and services by one of the room managers and given a complimentary drink. The room was wonderful and had every comfort you needed. The balcony looked out across the Gateway to India monument but alas the mesh which stops you from jumping ( or possibly stops the birds ) causes a"
"We have recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and it was memorable in Taj mahal Palace, service are good, staff are well professional, I feel luxuries and soothe life in hotel, there situated at the water’s edge one can find cultural heritage. So that is great opportunities for me to stay five star Mumbai hotels.  I Book Taj Mahal Palace From Go Heritage India Journeys Company.  For Information Visit The Site:  http://www.mumbai5starhotels.com/"
"We arrived in Mumbai on April 11th 2013 and were not too jet lagged to be completely amazed by the Taj Palace. We were in a Luxury Grand Sea View room on the 2nd floor, overlooking the Gateway to India. The bed was super comfortable and, although I always travel with a down pillow, I didn't need to for this hotel as the pillows were perfect!. The bathroom was glorious with HUGE tub and lovely shower room with a rain shower. the wifi was not free but it worked really well so it was worth it.  Dinner in the Masala Craft restaurant was a delight and the first of so many wonderful meals in India. Breakfast at the Sea Lounge was delicious and the staff are so welcoming. The staff at the hotel are ALL so friendly and helpful without any feeling of intrusion. We were at the Taj for 3"
"After one hour drive from the airport, one would reach the busy area of Colaba, the most southern point of Mumbai  There, situated at the water’s edge one can find cultural heritage; The Taj Mahal Palace.  The flagship hotel of the Taj Hotels, Resorts and Palaces is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World and provides a stay to remember, especially if accommodation is booked in the opulent Palace wing. The Taj Mahal Palace, being more a legend than a hotel is a property which should be visited at least once in a lifetime.   The hotel has not only impressed with polished service beyond expectations it provides also easy access to major tourist sites and entertainment areas. The hotels location is in proximity to historic buildings, fabulous for sightseeing and a few footsteps"
"It credits Mumbai a lot, a wonderfully placed and beautifully carved hotel. Love the service and compliments Mumbai perfectly. I loved to sip on a cup of coffee and watch the sea form there, the staff were friendly and provided me with all the comforts possible. The chinese food was brilliant in the restaurant. Love the ambience."
I wonder; had Mr. Watson's hotel not insulted Mr. Tata would we have had this marvel in Mumbai?  I dont quite care about the Towering extension from the inside nor the redone lobby of the new wing. But the Palace - its something else. Its almost like staying in an art gallery with the numerous pieces on display within. A photographer would easily need a year to capture the various facets of this Diamond.   I live in Mumbai and checked in to celebrate my son's birthday.  Stayed at a Harbour facing room.  It's a view worth paying for. The room itself is luxurious - redone with an old world charm almost as it was before the unfortunate incident that shook the City called 26/11.  The old world extends to the service too where nothing is left to chance. Breakfast at the SeaLounge is
"Had lunch here, was most enjoyable. Waiter moved us to the best table and view for two. Food western and after so many curries divine, impeccable service and will choose this hotel to stay next time. Flowers in foyers exquisite a great experience and the waiter made our day. Thank you"
"We recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and it was memorable. The Taj group have to be the best in India. The staff are brilliant and always smiling. The building is full of the most beautiful flowers and works of art. A special thanks to Satish, Head Concierge for arranging a perfect tour for us. If you book a tour ask for Jeetra. She is very knowledgeable. We will definitely return."
"Many good things but not excellent in some of the food and facilities , like the small pool.  But its a must see part of the tourism trail in Mumbai.  The Oberoi has more style and luxury in our view, but a great Japanese restaurant at the Taj if you need a chnage from Indian."
"I stayed at the wonderful Taj Mahal hotel with my boyfriend for three nights in April. It was the end of a three week trip in India and what a way to finish. The hotel was just magnificent, from the amazing decor to the wonderful restaraunts and the fab pool. The location is perfect. I can't describe how much we loved it. We will certainly be visiting again."
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for 3 nights at the end of a 3 week tour of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.  We were at first extremely disappointed as we were given a room in the Tower (new wing).  It wasn't at all what we thought we had booked, it was shabby with stained carpets and furnishings.  We of course complained and asked to be moved and were given a Suite in the newly renovated Old Wing.  This Suite was amazing, just as we had originally expected, with fantastic views of the India Gateway and the ocean.  The famous Stair Case is spectacular as is the decor of this fabulous old hotel.  We had dinner twice in Wasabi and it was fantastic both times, the food and service were both exceptional.  Thank you to Pradeep and his staff.  The spa treatments were also excellent"
This place has so much to surprise every time you visit. The service is 2nd to none and food amazing.The rooms are nicely refurbished. Excellent staff thats what makes this place so special. Ever lasting experience but only suggestion is need to do something on exterior appearance. 
My Partner and I stayed at this hotel in March for 3 nights and enjoyed it very much We dined in two of their signature restaurants and were not disappointed .We took a superior room which was great and a stunning view of the Gates of India The pool area is a wonderful place to relax at after busy days in the city Service was good and the concierge were very helpful and  responsive  After our stay we took off for Udaipur for a 3 night treat at the Taj Lake Palace ...
"Taj Mahal Palace - An institution in itself in the service industry. Well, no words can match the hospitality, the warmth, the service- Taj offers. My husband and I could not travel outside Mumbai to celebrate our 1st marriage anniversary, but what better way than to spend a night at Taj Old Wing, best as it could get. We had dinner at Masala Kraft, amazing food, awesome ambience and superb service. We loved the 45 minute tour of the hotel learning the history of the heritage property. No words to describe... Would go again and again..."
"Amazing stay. Service and facilities unmatched by any hotel we’ve stayed in (Mid-november 2012).  The history and majesty of this hotel needs to be experienced to be believed. It must be said that our experience was enhanced by an upgrade to a suite (best hotel room either of us have ever seen) but in any case this hotel was a highlight for us even though we only spent one night there. Word of warning though, the restaurants in this hotel are all extremely expensive albeit very nice. If we stay again we will eat outside the hotel.   The staff were all very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was full of variety and excellent quality.  5 staff service all the way!  Location is also brilliant, close to shops, restaurants and the sea.  It is opposite the Gateway of"
"A fantastic hotel.  Great service, fabulous restaurants, lovely pool, plentiful shopping and to-die-for breakfast buffet.  The rooms in historic section of the hotel are spacious and beautiful.  The tower, minus views of the water, is atrocious, inside and out. The spa could use a rehab and the exterior, pool, terraces could use a rehaul (tired) but don't miss this iconic hotel (unless your only option is the tower)."
"Not much to say about this hotel, in my opinion, this is simply as good as it gets! I stayed in the Palace wing which has been beautifully restored, offers fantastic large and comfortable rooms, with a number of additional service extras.  All of the colonial details throughout the property offers an absolutely fantastic experience.  The service is polished, polite and efficient, without being overbearing.  Really well balanced, offering grand luxury while allowing guests to still feel laid back and comfortable.  I highly recommend to anyone travelling to Mumbai for business or leisure."
"I and my wife checked into the Taj for our anniversary and had one of the most memorable experiences. Upon check-in, we were told that we have been upgraded to the next category of room. When we entered, the room was filled with balloons and flowers for us, The staff was well aware of our celebrations and everywhere in the Hotel we were congratulated and welcomed.  We were very impressed with the hospitality and warmth of the entire team at the Taj.  The only thing we were a little disappointed with was the quality of Breakfast served to us in Room service. Though Food at their restaurants like THE GOLDEN DRAGON was avante garde.  Would recommend it to all"
"The Taj Mahal Palace lives up to its grand reputation. My stay was wonderful. But not only because of the hotel’s beauty and opulence. During my time there, I had a family emergency and needed to fly back home earlier than expected. Two gentlemen at the hotel’s Travel Desk made multiple phone calls on my behalf to the airline’s offices in Mumbai, London and New York. As a result of their persistence, I was able to change my reservation and also receive a refund for the cancelled ticket. Other staff members were considerate as well. Halfway through breakfast at the Sea Lounge, the waiter asked if I’d like to be moved to a table facing the Arabian Sea because a table had become free – the view and the food were unforgettable."
"I read the reviews before staying here and was a bit skeptical.  All of my fears were allayed - it's absolutely beautiful! The service was first rate all the way - the room was beautiful, but a little small (think San Francisco or NY boutique hotels!).  We ate at both the Indian and the Chinese Restaurants and the food was excellent - the Indian restaurant lacks atmosphere though ..it has a cafeteria feel.  The swimming area is gorgeous and it's lovely to sit out there for coffee or breakfast!  The security is excellent so no worries there! Would definitely recommend - ask for sea facing room - well worth the extra!"
"It was a awesome place. Would highly recommend staying at Taj Mahal palace, most definitely one of 'THE BEST' hotels in the world. Super clean, comfortable, staff very attentive. Hotel car to collect you from the airport is definitely worth it, can be arranged prior to departure. Food, drink, rooms, pool all amazing! Could not fault..."
"Everything you read here about this hotel is correct!  We had a club room, which entitled us to a complimentary pick up from the airport and we arrived in Mumbai in style. The room had, as requested, a fantastic view of the Gateway to India and the plush room was very comfortable, but these rooms do not come cheap but are worth every rupee.   The pool area is fantastic and a welcome relief from the madness on the city. We made use of the club lounge, which was very good, however, a little over stuffy for us. We were a bit disappointed that 2 guests had been able to reserve a table of their choice, which in my opinion should not be a service provided as the club lounge is for all club guests to enjoy without preferential treatment. The canapes were nice but I expected a higher"
"its a sight to the the Taj standing bold to the doors of India facing the sea and the gateway of India as i take a glimpse from outside. You enter the porch and the durbaan quickly and smartly opens your door with a driver ready to park your vehicle in the parking slot. Incidently although i have a big car, my car name plate also displays army along the number plate as also the wind shield. this provided an extra attention to me as within five minutes of my entry into the hotel the general manager was at the reception to recieve me. perhaps i have seen the flip side in 2008. within next five minutes we were in our suite facing the sea. what a service. you call for the room service and they respond in less than 30 seconds. you order your meal and in flat 20 mins its served to"
"Would highly recommend staying at Taj Mahal palace, most definitely one of 'THE BEST' hotels in the world. Super clean, comfortable, staff very attentive.  Hotel car to collect you from the airport is definitely worth it, can be arranged prior to departure. Food, drink, rooms, pool all amazing! Could not fault it. Directly in front of gateway to India. You truly feel you are in a palace, two nights wasn't long enough."
"I have never in my life experienced the level of service I encountered at the Taj Mahal Paalce.  Stayed in a suite for 4 nights and the experience was exceptional.  I've stayed in rooms at comparable prices in London and Paris and DC but Taj Mahal Palace exceeds them all in terms of service. The hotel is just magically fantastic.  It has all the splendour, opulence and charm of the British Raj era with it's enormous multi-level stairway and chandeliers.  The suite was easily the largest I've stayed in.  The amenities were lovely. The complimentary water was kept well stocked but the little touches were mainly what blew me away with this hotel, my hair straightener cord carefully wrapped up in a coil and kept together with a velcro hook, lens wipes next to my reading glasses on"
"This is not my first experience of four, five or even seven star hotels, but it certainly ranks as one of the best. The building is impressive and the rooms well appointed, but what makes a good hotel great in my experience is the staff and the people at the Taj Mahal Palace were superb, without exception. The pool area was a delight to come back to after a city visit and the drinks and snacks were not overly expensive. We could have stayed on Marine Drive, but I'm glad we made this choice it was worth every extra cent! If, like us,  you're visiting Mumbai for the one and only time, stay here."
"Wonderful grandiose hotel built more than a century ago and overlooking the sea and the gate of India . Huge property with a lot of luxury boutiques , a number of restaurants , a superb swimming pool , excellent service at all levels and relatively inexpensive for an hotel of this category . A real delight . To be recommended . Reserve in the old building if you can afford it or in the new building where the rooms are less luxurious but you have access to the same facilities"
"We were given a 16th floor room in the Tower Wing and were immediately opposite The Gateway to India.  A view to die for.  Highlight was seeing an eagle soar past our window!  A separate top sheet would be appreciated as the duvet is rather heavy.  Staff were most caring and attentive, especially as my husband had picked up a stomach bug in Patan.  I had in-room dining as he was unwell.  Worth paying for this.  The trolley table and attentiveness of the gentleman who delivered it were outstanding and the food was piping hot and there was far more than I expected.  Breakfast was slightly disappointing.  Good porridge but the fresh mango ran out and was not replaced whilst I was there, similarly the honeycomb.  Bacon was totally overdone and ruined!  Was offered some soft bacon,"
"We spent the last three nights of our honeymoon here. The hotel is breathtakingly beautiful, decorated with opulent and rich furniture whilst still maintaining a feeling of being fresh and light. The service was perfect, staff that were eager to help, but maintained their distance until you need them. Of particular note was one concierge (whose name I didn't catch), but he gives the hotel tour every afternoon. He was such a likable and friendly host and went out of his way to know our names (and even welcomed me in Irish, which was such an unexpected but lovely gesture).   The buffet breakfast is superb, we stayed and relaxed with the papers and really enjoyed our  breakfasts each day. I don't think I'd stay anywhere else in Mumbai if we go back, as I think I'd be disappointed."
"The hotel is nice enough. The housekeeping staff are friendly, the rooms nice and the gym is first class. The breakfast leaves a lot to be desired however. I ordered pancakes one morning and asked specifically for them plain. They arrived at my table drenched in butter. I returned the meal and after 5 minutes a chef arrived at my table, dumped the plate in front of me and walked off without saying a word. I ate one pancake and the next one I cut into was completely raw inside and oozed batter all over my plate. Later that morning a member of staff came to my room to enquire as to how my stay was going. I pointed out the issue with my morning meal and was told that the duty manager would be in touch. Im still waiting. The security staff are rude and on more than one occasion"
"Spent 4 days here. From we arrived til we left everyone was so nice. Celebrated our wedding anniversary and got upgraded to palace wing with balloons, flowers and cake. Went on free hotel tour and free walk worth it. Went on to stay at Trident Narnien point it was good but wish we'd have stayed at Taj everything on it's doorstep. If going to Mumbai you have to stay at the Taj"
"Like many before us, our special experience began at the airport, where a driver and guide gently parted us from our baggage, dealt sharply and efficiently with the local taxi drivers, and began our introduction to Mumbai with a commentary on all we passed, a social history lesson, and very balanced answers to our many questions. Security on entry to the hotel was understandably tight, and then balanced by a check in in the comfort of the lounge, garlanded, and with a most pleasant (non-alcoholic) cocktail in hand. We stayed in the heritage wing, and were upgraded to a sea view, which offered ever changing views of the throngs round the Gateway to India. The interior of this wing is principally cool wood, reminscent of colonial days. From our window, too, we could see the side"
"Well, yes, it is a very special place with such sent of India, the services are very kind, the ambience is a dream, wake up and have thee view of India's gate is special. The care with our comfort in little details like flowers arranges and amenities is kind as well. But let's say: Internet non complementary, canon, this is an incredible hotel, that receive as guests people from all over that need to keep in touch with their life and business, and he owner of both, hotel and Internet services a the same! It's not about the price, it's about give to the guest of such a classy hotel simple things as connection! They didn't charge us because our comment about, so, if you go there, do not forget to comment or pay for the service."
"From the moment the hotel met us at the backache collection point at mumbai airport, we knew this was going to be an amazing hotel...  The gentleman introduced us to the driver, who ensured everything was perfect for the drive to the hotel...  The welcome was astounding, we checked in whilst walking to our room where we were met by out butler. He introduced us to the hotel, our room - then met us to walk us around the restaurants till we found somewhere we were comfortable...  Service at this hotel is warm, friendly and playful... I was admiring a picture on a wall and a porter noticed and organised photos to be left in our room.!!!!  The cultural tour is amazing, the walking tour of mumbai is informative...  Overall, if you have an opportunity to stay at this hotel - take"
"You can feel the history in this hotel. From the Kennedys to the Clintons, this is the hotel of choice for anyone that is looking for a true bombay experience. The lobby is grande, the rooms are colonial to say the least and the location on the Gateway of India is fantastic. Had a chance to dine at several of the restaurants and all of them were delicious. Would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting mumbai."
"Excellent!!!  Love the food, place and everything. You shouldn't really bother about money when your being taken care of so well at times :). Great ambience! Loved the tour at the Taj Mahal hotel which was a guided tour. Superb!"
"We started our recent holiday to India with close friends here in Mumbai with only one recommendation for our hotel in Mumbai, The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and it def didn't disappoint.  From checking in, the fabulous view of the Gateway, the excellent service at the pool and restaurants, our stay could not have been any better. I would like to commend all of the staff, from housekeeping to the security outside, they all made the stay exactly as it had been described to us...... Wonderful. Thankyou."
"I loved this hotel, it truly is the best in Mumbai.  The rooms are of a high standard but the best part is the public parts of the hotel which are very grand.  My room overlooked the India Gate which was awesome.  I was also shown around the presidential suite which was great.  The service is impeccable and the restaurant excellent too.  Worth every penny."
We did two nights here after doing 4 nights at the Taj Lands end at Bandra.I booked the hotel from the Lands end using the Club lounge Butler and she negotiated a discounted price on a  suite called the Elephantra that is the closest room/suite to the Gateway to India.We had a small Balcony that was covered in Flywire to stop the pigeons pooping all over it.The pigeons are everywhere and are fed huge quantities of grain in the car park below so will be a ongoing problem.I was a little shocked when we were ushered into the suite as it was contemporary in design and I was expecting something more in keeping with the history of the building.The hotel has been completely reglazed with double glass aluminium windows which suprised me.I didnt feel it was in keeping with the historic
"Alas only one night here but we were thoroughly spoilt  we stayed in the old part of the hotel, where nothing was too much trouble. The pool area was lovely and a great place to relax after a sightseeing tour. The beds are so comfortable. We ate in the Indian restaurant food was excellent with a great wine list. The service throughout the hotel could not be faulted. I liked the the check in where you sat at a small desk rather than the huge long desk.  Located right by the Gateway to India"
"While traveling to an academic conference hosted at the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai, I had the opportunity to listen to the Taj Hotel Group CEO talk about their customer-centric service philosophy.  He talked about an old local mantra that states ""The Guest is God"", a saying which is closely followed by the Taj Mahal Palace employees.  After spending 8 days at the premises, there is no doubt in my mind that this staff takes that mantra to heart.  Infrastructure - The hotel is a magnificent landmark and a beautiful combination of Indian and Victorian architecture.  No expense was spared and the hotel is as lavish as any, particularly public places.  A special note on rooms, they get the job done but are not out of this world (standard rooms, that is).    Service - As the title of"
"I've stayed at most of the higher end hotels in South Mumbai, and while the Oberoi is swankier and the Trident is better value for the money, this is the place to stay if you (or better yet, someone else) can afford it. (And if not, just come back during the monsoon.) Palace Wing was renovated after the attacks, so the rooms are not only more historic, but also newer. But the Tower is also fine, though some rooms show wear and tear, particularly in the bathrooms, and the sea views are better from the higher floors in the Tower.  Service is amazing - one morning I asked to have my luggage repaired and for some mangoes and when I came back, I had a new suitcase handle and a crate of Alphonsoes for about Rs1500. Breakfast can be crowded at business hours, but the food is wonderful."
"I can't begin to explain just how highly we rate this hotel. The service was discreet but excellent,  every need was anticipated, every request accomodated. We ate in the Chinese restaurant which was excellent and they even cooked a special order of char siu fan for our 8 year old daughter. We had a wonderful day relaxing around the pool and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this oasis of a hotel. The breakfast in the sea lounge was delicious with possibly the best masala dosa I have ever eaten  It was my second stay here, I came before with my husband, and he has stayed there for business and we were happy that the experience as a family was every bit as good as previous stays. We also very much appreciated the large collection of contemporary Indian art that lined the walls.  We"
I was being treated by my great friend at this restaurant and it was an excellant experience. Visiting the restaurant after a gap of 20 years it was a great moment when my friend suggested this restaurant.  Food was awesome and so was the service. Elvis who attended to us was very useful in selecting the food and and beverages they were great.
"If you want stay in a special place in Mumbai to feel the old colonial atmosphere you can't miss the Taj Mahal Place. The lobby, the corridors and the wonderful courtyard will bring you back in time. The photographic gallery of the VIP guests who stayed there will contribute to brighten the aura around this place.  The hotel is located in a prime location : just few meters away from the iconic Gate of India and the most visited tourist area of Mumbai.      The hotel service is outstanding,  the indian restaurant in the hotel serve great food in a good ambience.  There is also a fantastic courtyard with a swimming pool (see photos) The room I stayed was clean but definitely need some refurbishing (feels a bit old). With a freshen room definitely the hotel would get a  5 stars"
"We stayed at this magnificent Hotel in March 2013, I mentioned when checking in that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary & were upgraded to a Palace room. Breakfast was fantastic & the staff went out of there way to make sure you got what you wanted when you wanted it. The location is perfect for any walking or trip to Elephant Island &again the staff were ready to assist with any planning 10/10"
"Having just returned from a three night stay, at the end of our India trip, I feel we have been blessed to have had the opportunity of staying at this magnificent hotel.  The service and attention to detail are the best we have ever come across on our varied travels. From entering the hotel, until departure, this is a very special experience. Needless to say the pool, bars and two restaurants we ate in matched the magnificence of the surroundings, with the Middle Eastern restaurant (Souk) at the top of the hotel being especially impressive. However, we did try to get a reservation at the Japanese restaurant for the Friday night and it was fully booked so, if you have a dining preference, it is best to book a table in advance.  Crucially, I would also say though that, given the"
"Its a rare opportunity for a Mumbaikar like me to be staying in the iconic hotel of once own city. I got this opportunity thanks to a 3 nights 4 days residential conference by my employer. Impeccable hospitality as we were 300 plus and had booked 150+ rooms. The hotel works with clock like precision.  Tried Masala craft, wasabi and Starboard. Highly recommended must do in Mumbai.....This place is Icon and History...."
It was nice to stay in the hotel for 2 days.We really felt happy.It provides all facilities for reasonable prices.Nice to see Beach in the morning.Everyone should stay in the hotel at least for one day.This trip is most memorable in my life that i spent with my family.
"If you are looking to travel to Indian anytime soon make sure you stay at least one night at the luxury Taj Palace.  From the shear minuite you arrive you are greeted by the most welcome i have ever experienced.  The hotel is stunning in all manor and surely lives to the name ""Palace"", you cannot fault anything form the luxury rooms to the service.  I almost felt the staff were doing too much i would class this as beyond 5 star by far.  The food is fit for a king never i enjoyed such luxuries and elegance, almost felt as a week for too short of a stay beautifull hotel."
"I have visited this hotel yesterday on 09.04.2013, I was dreaming about and thinking about hotel from my childhood and now it's come true. I had take dinner at roof top restaurant and enjoyed bar at ground floor. Nice famous hotel in India as well as world."
"We arrived for our two night stay at the Taj Mahal Palace rather tired after a long drive and flight to Mumbai from Nagpur. We were very delighted to hear that we had been upgraded from the club room we had booked to a suite - and what a superb suite it was. The lobby area of the suite alone was as big as some hotel rooms we have stayed in, the lounge and dining room was beautifully furnished, the bedroom was again luxurious, spacious and very nicely furnished, with a very comfortable bed and the bathroom was excellent too. There was also a very well designed wardrobe/dressing area. Our travel agent had told the hotel of our 40th wedding anniversary celebration trip and that is probably why we were upgraded (we had also stayed at  five other Taj properties on this trip which"

"The first time I stayed here in the late 1990's I ran into the Supermodel Cindy Crawford, literally, as I  was walking up some stairs outside. The Taj was only outdone in beauty by Ms Crawford at the time. The hotel is still beautiful.  I have also stayed at the Oberoi down on the point a few times, which is also very good, but I suppose I prefer the old world charm of the Taj.  Its Mumbai ! Get into it.  I have to say that the best lunch in town is put on here as well.  Hotels are expensive in Mumbai, but its worth the stretch if you can make it. Particularly if you have the luxury of being in Mumbai for holiday as opposed to business."
"I stayed there in late March 2013 with my family and my 15 months old son. The staff were very helpful and understanding and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. The housekeeping staff would wash the baby's bottles for me and the staff at the breakfast buffet would get me a small take away box to take some breakfast up for the sleeping baby when he wakes up. That said, the hotel is very expensive. Food and beverages and basically everything else."
"Last time I visited the Hotel Taj, Apollo Bunder. This is very good experience for me. Room is very good and specious. Room Service is also good. Lift and Passage area are easily accessible and clean up to the mark. Swimming pool Lounge is fantastic.  Restaurant in the Heritage wing were also best in the Test."
We were upgraded complimentary by taj to their club rooms 5 th floor palace wing we were so lucky we stayed 3 nights and then stayed 3 more night opulent describes this stay it was the last hotel of our tour of wonderfully india and it was a lovely finish we were their for the Hindi colour festival and we got covered in paint and the hotel staff made us laugh as we did look a mess walking into this hotel it is a posh hotel but they love you to enjoy yourself and dress up or dress down its not a problem we think six nights was just right thankyou taj and see you again
Great place. Historical. Great rooms. Fine food. Small poll but sufficient. Spa is excellent. (Massages are also good right in back of the hotel in the Thai place).   Take the'hotel tour'. Walk around the outside to appreciate the architecture. Take a picture from the plaza with your backs toward the hotel.   Short walk to museums and Kolaba market.
"We had a suite and it was one of my best ever hotel experiences. Stunningly well appointed room, fabulously comfortable, brilliant service, super location - impossible to fault. The restaurants were also first class and we enjoyed use of the club lounge with free drinks for suite guests. The staff are hovering at all times, ready and willing to help and serve you at any time. It has a great world-wide reputation and it is fully deserved."
"i recently stayed at the taj and i was expecting a room in the tower,cheaper but still lovely,imagine my surprise when i checked in and was told i was being upgraded to a room in the main hotel!!! the room was just wonderful,every little detail was beautiful and so much space! my time passed like a dream and i just didn't want to leave.if ever you are in mumbai and you can afford it i urge you to try the taj,you will not be disappointed!!!"
"We have just stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai at the end of March 2013. Although we arrived from London at 3 am, we were given a wonderful welcome and were also delighted to be given a free upgrade to a room in the heritage wing. The hotel is an absolute oasis in one of the world's busiest cities. Staff are very friendly and address you by your name, but are never sycophantic. The large swimming pool is a delight, and there are excellent toilets and changing facilities at the spa near the pool. We always breakfasted in the old-world comfort of Sea Lounge. There are plenty of alternative restaurants within the hotel, and there are opportunities to window shop in the indoor shopping mall that resembles the best of Knightsbridge! We did take the opportunity of the free tour of"
"I recently stayed at the Taj Mumbai for 2 nights at the end of a Holiday. Overall I found the service excellent (a part from the waiters in the outside area near the pool). Though sun loungers are at a premium it has a nice sheltered pool if you wish to relax. Despite not being able to revive the true greatness of the Harbour Bar (following the terrorist attacks) I would definetly recommend a visit for their signature cocktail. Breakfast are great too, but I recommend that you get there early, as a line can build dury busy times.  The tour of the hotel which is performed everyday is good if its your first time to the hotel (Though, I would say that the lady who took us around had a very low opinion of the British)"
My husband and I spent 2 days at the Taj and it was the most amazing experience. The staff are the best and treated us with such royalty I wish all hotels were like that.The food was fresh and very tasty. The pool and the gardens were amazing. I loved it and I would go back.
"It is a Good hotel to stay in, if you the right kind of cash. The hotel is fully refurbished, standard rooms are cosy, well maintained. The service can be bit better, the response at times is tardy. Restaurants are good, however the breakfast choice is limited (repeated menus- in case you stay for longer duration). Overlooking the gate way of India and nice dining places nearby."
"My husband and I stayed here for two nights on our honeymoon and we were truly blown away by this hotel. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, the service here is second to none. The real charm though, is all the character and old world charm this special place holds, it really is an experience like no other. This is my new favorite hotel, would never stay anywhere else in mumbai."
"This is my favourite hotel in the world and best in Mumbai. It has style and true class unlike some of the other over-the-top 5 stars in Mumbai. It is also located in the best part of Mumbai, in my opinion. I have been visiting this hotel about 5 times a year in the past decade or so and most of the staff remain the same and are charming as ever. Of course the Palace wing rocks but The Tower is also good especially if you get a room overlooking the Gateway with a little balcony. It's not that expensive if you compare other so-called nearby 'value budget' hotels nearby which are actually just about 25% less than a room at the Taj. So, dump the Diplomat and go for the Taj. You will not be disappointed! Treat yourself; you live only once!  It's the little things, done often by the"
"This is not my first trip to India, however my first time to Mumbai. When I flew in in February I did not have time to enjoy Mumbai but on my way out of India I decided to treat myself. On this trip I stayed a small hotel in Udaipur, a homestay in Jaipur and my uncle's flat in Kolkata. Writing my family tree I found out that both my father and my uncle left India in the 1960's through Mumbai and stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai.  As I meeting planner I wanted to experience the service at the Taj. When I checked in March 31at Priyanka the Duty Manager checked me in, welcomed me and brought me up to my room and sent some juice  to begin my stay. I was in the new building but with a balcony and beautiful view.  My favourite part was the pool area and the garden. I"
"I have been here many times always leisure visits.  I really love this hotel especially if you stay in the heritage wing.  Breakfast is great, everything is nearby and the Laughing Club at the Gateway to India is great fun with lovely people if you can peel yourself off the lovely bed at 7 am.  Views to the Gateway superb and if you like people/street watching just looking out of the window is fun.  One of the pool men even remembered my name from a year back - those touches are just so lovely.  The flower arrangements in the reception areas are quite astonishing.   I had a late check out but still several hours to kill before heading off to the airport so I left all my baggage at the hotel while I went out for a meal with my Indian family and then returned to the hotel to"
"Me and my friend Pinal were stayed in this hotel where we went for few drinks @ Harbor Bar in the same hotel ( ground floor level ).  The Bar tender Mr. Mistry and his colleague offered this wonderful and historical cocktail by explaining the entire story that how it was invented. All together it was wonderful experience and the making process of the cocktail was very much eye catching, heating up alcohol and then burning on the flame in adding up to my glass to drink.  Next came a cart with two wine glasses, both filled with sliced fruits and gin and perched at an angle over tiny tea-lamps. Another glass contained some freshly squeezed fruit juice mixed with ice. Mr. Mistry shook the juice in a cocktail-shaker and poured it into yet another glass. Then, very carefully, he set"
"Needs no introduction. Simply put the best place to stay in Mumbai. Stayed in a room in the heritage wing. Fantastic room, spotless and comfortable room. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Ate at the Kraft Masala - tasty food. Good service. The most wonderful thing is to eat breakfast by the poolside in the open. Amazing atmosphere. Or have a beer by the pool in the evenings. Always enjoy coming abck to the hotel."
"Wow! This was the last place we stayed after nine weeks of travelling around India and we were simply blown away by the Taj in every respect. The quality of service, furnishings, food... Everything was simply outstanding. We loved the bars, the restaurants, the rooms, the pool and the amazing staff. A real iconic hotel and an oasis of calm in the craziness of Mumbai. I'm honoured to say that I stayed there."
"A truly, truly memorable experience from start to finish. It is difficult to overstate just how beautiful this place is. I should state for the purposes of this review that I love colonial as a style, so I appreciate it may not be to everyone's taste. Having said that, there is still something for everyone.   I strongly recommend spending the extra money and stay in the heritage/palace wing. The architecture and period features alone make this worthwhile. We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to the club floor, with our own butler service and extras such as cocktails and canapés in the evening. Nonetheless, the level of service was truly second to none, with nothing too difficult including helping us checkin for our return flight online and providing us with the boarding"
"Traveled through Mumbai on the way to Dubai. This hotel is amazing.   I stayed on the Palace side, but was able to see a room on the tower side. My preference is the older Palace side, and it was simply amazing.   The staff could not be any better, and they make you feel like a rock star. The food in the restaurants was fantastic. Had an amazing ginger drink in the Harbor Bar, and there is an outdoor area to smoke a cigar on the other side of the lobby.   My overall view of Mumbai is a bit different however. Once you walk out the door of this hotel, you are in a completely different world. There are some photo ops at the Gateway of India. However, it is here that the poverty of this country hits you in the face.   There are more homeless here than I have seen in any other"
"It's easy to see why the Taj Mahal Palace is rated Mumbai's top hotel.  The location and provenance of this historic hotel is hard to beat and makes the hotel a tourist attraction in its own right.  However, being a large hotel in India's biggest city, it can seem a little impersonal compared with smaller Indian hotels.  We only spent two nights at the hotel, so didn't have time to use all its facilities, such as the pool, fitness centre or restaurants.  However, we were generally pretty happy with the quality of our accommodation in the palace wing and the service provided by staff.   We would definitely stay at the Taj Mahal Palace again if we returned to Mumbai, partcularly as it is relatively affordable compared to other hotels in the Taj group."
Beautiful and huge hotel.   Stunning in every area - service second to none.  We had two fantastic meals in the Mexican and Chinese restaurants within the hotel - the Chinese meal was the best of its kind I have ever enjoyed.   A world class hotel in a very interesting city.
I could not leave the Mumbai reveiws without mentioning this great hotel! I was not allowed to place it in my reviews of restaurants. It is a beautiful Hotel made whole again and has a lovely restaurant for lunch.. The shops here are excellent and worth your visit.  There is so much history if you can only go for lunch or dinner I strongly suggest you do so.
"After staying 4 nights at a hotel in Juhu Beach we moved across to the city centre to enjoy a stay in the the Palace Wing of the Taj Mahal Palace.  Enjoyed the private check-in area and the elegance and old world charm of this grand old building.  The decor of the hotel is outstanding and represents the era in which is was constructed.  Loved the massive staircase and the open corridors.  Had a one bedroom suite that enjoyed a nice sized lounge, big bedroom and gorgeous bathroom with lots of marble and a deep soaking tub.  Closets everywhere!  The suite actually had 2 entrances - one into the living area and the second entrance into the bedroom and bathroom.  Beds very comfortable and room spotlessly clean.  I enjoyed everything about the accomodations.  Room service for dinner"
"To review a Taj property like this with so much of history and character seems a daunting task. Located right at gate way of India, old wing over look the sea and have been newly renovated, the Tower side offer reasonable view of the city. Had a lunch buffet - when compared with similar ITC lay out I would say ITC scores better here. They have an excellent Chinese restaurant, though prices are quite a whack on pocket but then you pay for the ambience, On top floor they have a Mediterranean eating place with good view.   As it is located at heart of most bustling place, downside of that being its not very quite outside, even within the hotel as it houses certain premium shopping the lobby is always crowded I was there on a Sunday. Over all if you have the money to splurge be a"
"We had tea here once and watched the finals of the cricket world cup in their bar/restaurant.  It was wonderful, no one disturbed us.  The next time we stayed here for a couple days in an amazing room with a full frontal view of the Gateway of India and the sea!  The hotel was really great in every way, I think I have used up all the adjectives of praise."
"A destination with Roamwithom our private tour delighted in the peaceful presence of the cool lobby. Flowers and carved sandstone walls a modern look in ancient roots.  The rooms are tranquil. The hallways are historic. The pool, a blue tear in the heart of Bombay.  They won my heart nowI Roamwithom."
we had afternoon tea and the reviews here and what I will write will not do it adequate justice.  you get to choose form a vast array of tea and coffee.  then you are served with a three tiered cake stand full of western traditional afternoon tea items.  on top of this was an amazing buffet included in the price with everything you could possibly want all with the incredible surrounds of the sea lounge. try to get a window seat and ask the waiters about the palace.  what an amazing way to finish 12 weeks in india.  it is 1500 ruppees all inclusive of everything you could possibly want!!
"after a long arduous 2.5 hour wait to clear immigration at the airport due to the inefficiency of the ""tourist visa on arrival"" process, and a short-ish one hour drive, we arrived at the Taj Mahal Palace and were quickly checked in. we were given a ""club level"" room which was on the fifth floor and had a beautiful view of the Gateway of India. the club level gives you some additional benefits like complimentary afternoon tea, cocktail hour and after dinner cognac and chocolate in the Palace Room. this was a very nice treat as there were some good snacks provided with the cocktails. the service at the hotel was excellent and the breakfast selection was quite incredible. we enjoyed the historical tour of the hotel and also had a very nice dinner at the indian restaurant, neel"
We stayed here during a very brief stay in Mumbai (only two nights). It's not the cheapest of hotels that's for sure but it's fun to splash out occasionally and the Taj doesn't disappoint. It's a surprising distance from the Airport if - like us - you haven't done your research properly! but we got the Hotel to arrange a pick up and all went swimmingly well. The room we had (in the Tower) was lovely and the view - particularly at night - was good.  We ate in the Indian and the Japenese restaurant during our stay. The Japanese was the best by far but that may have been something to do with the signature cocktail we had in the bar below it. This is prepared with great flourish at your table along with the history of how it came about. We couldn't understand our waiter all that
"Most of the other reviews on this hotel sum it up.  We had a brilliant experience - the rooms are clean and lovely, the bed was very comfy and the location is brilliant for anyone wanting to visit the tourist sites - shopping wise you're probably better off in the Santa Cruz area.  The breakfast was fantastic - all in all worth the money!"
We spent three nights in a Luxury Grand Sea View Room overlooking the Gateway To India.  The interior of this hotel is absolutely brilliant and vastly exceeded our expectations at least in the Palace portion as we never saw the Tower interior.  One of the most beautiful interiors we have ever seen.  Our room was fairly small but very comfortable and beautifully decorated with a great bathroom.  The pool area is wonderful and a great escape from hectic Mumbai.  The location is wonderful for exploring and the breakfast and food  and bar service we had were all you could ask for.  We wouldn't stay anywhere else in Mumbai.
"Beautiful rooms, fantastic service from picking us up at the airport to delivering the most awesome room service and what an oasis to return to after a day trip out exploring Mumbai.  Lunch on the veranda was great.  The history behind this hotel and the awesome interior was fascinating.  Best bit:  although I didn't shop for anything this time.....must be the lobby Louis Vuitton store!"
"Well, how can one add to the information about one the best known hotels in the world, over a century hold, witness to history in the making as few buildings anywhere have been. The hotel, which opened its doors in 1903, is still for many a once in a lifetime experience.   Located in Bombay’s art deco district of Colaba right next to the Gateway of India, the building is one of the most recognized buildings in India, and definitely its best known hotel. It is within walking or short cab rides from most historic parts of the city’s south, though it has now become a little far from the emerging business areas to the north of the city. It is by the sea, though you are unlikely to hear it as the bay is fairly quiet. Incidentally, the back of the hotel faces the sea, and what was"
"What an amazing hotel. We arrived at the Airport at 4am to be met by a cheerful driver with water and cold towels on hand. We were met as we got out of the car by the receptionist who took us straight up to our Tower room on the 16th floor and checked us in there so we could get to bed as soon as possible after the flight from London. The atmosphere of the hotel is exceptional; breakfast outside near the pool is a great start to the day, the pool is an oasis in the city and the situation of the hotel is brilliant - very easy to walk to many of the sights including the magnificent railway station. All the staff were exceptional but we must pick out Viren D'Sa the Experiences Manager - he hosts both a free tour of the history of the hotel and also a free arts tour which was"
"I visited India with my family (4 kids) for a wedding and spent the first 3 days in Mumbai to relax and acclimate.  I had been to India before but the rest had not.  I knew there wasn't any other place that I wanted to stay with them except the Taj Mahal Palace hotel.  To begin The Taj is as amazing a hotel and provides even more amazing service as is well documented by these many phenomenal reviews.  But I want to talk about it specifically in respect to staying there with our children.  To begin my children are still pretty young and due to the travel and jet lag they basically spent the whole first day at the pool, which they absolutely loved and never tired of.  The pool is very beautiful and is a veritable oasis in the middle of the city.  The pool staff is amazingly"
"We celebrated our 25th marriage anniversary at this hotel and the treat was overwhelming. We stayed in the Heritage wing (upgraded by Taj) and the welcome was great. The room was decorated with balloons, greetings card , flower and delicious cake. The heritage wing has its own old order charm and the hotel staffs were always ready to help us with smiling face.The pool side experience was superb and we enjoyed throughly. The food at the chinese restaurent was mouth watering and the rooftop Souk restaurent had a breathtaking view. In summary a memorable experience which we can cherish for ever."
"I was travelling Mumbai directly from Varanasi and agra. It was great stay in Varanasi at Welcome Inn at Ganges. It was awesome experience for me in Varanasi even though it was not 5 star hotel. I was wondeing how it will be at Taj Mahal Palace but it was far better than my expectation. It can not be described in words. All I can say, It is same like Taj Mahal in agra. I have been trying to use different kind of hotel in current years and this is best among all."
"This was stay was part of a celebration and the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel was perfect. The arrival and check in was very friendly and efficient. We stayed in a Taj Club, the room was beautiful, with all the amenities we could have wanted.  Breakfast and high tea in the Palace Lounge were fantastic. The range and choice at breakfast was mind boggling offering Indian and European options. Similarly high tea was a feast. Access to the Club Lounge was very pleasant; the service was friendly without being familiar and the atmosphere very pleasant. Butler service was flawless, anticipating our needs and providing helpful information and advice. A definite recommendation and will return again soon."
"Simply  absolutely the best hotel experience I have ever had!  I was unsure I would enjoy such a high class hotel after years of experiences worldwide in similarly spectacular but often""haughty"" hotels when accompanying my husband on business trips.  Now I was a widow travelling alone but why did I worry!  During my five night stay in the Taj when I booked the lowest priced room to treat myself for my soon coming 70th birthday, I was treated like a little princess/Maharani and I felt relaxed and welcome from the moment I stepped through their doors into the heaven that is the Taj!    Every day the room attendants enhanced my stay in some little way (my cute rose petal decorated elephant made out of towels was a lovely treat which I just didn't expect in a ""cheap room""!) and on"
"Though I am a Bombay ite, spent a beautifully long weekend getting pampered at the Taj... And though I have traveled to different places and different hotels, the Taj hospitality stands unchallenged. Nowhere will you find more impeccably groomed staff, nowhere will you be treated with such politeness and nowhere will you find such attentiveness.   The rooms are really quite lovely and the hotel could not be located in a better part of Bombay...   The breakfast buffet - must must try... And their room service is very efficient...   I agreed to become a wife with the most romantic proposal at this hotel :)   A great location, a great hotel and a great experience."
"We are not wealthy and had it not been for a special offer B&B rate of around £165 per night inc taxes, then we certainly wouldn't / couldn't have stayed. We will eternally be grateful that we did. The Taj Mahal Palace offers a truly unforgettable experience for every resident, going 'above and beyond' in every conceivable way, from the garland & welcome drink on arrival, the highly entertaining and informative hotel tour, the complimentary walking city tour, the beautiful gifts left in the room, the comfy robes and slippers, the daily newspaper and handy one page news summary to muse over during the most incredible breakfast selection you will ever encounter to the most sublime fresh flower arrangements every where you turn.  The staff are all incredibly friendly and highly"
"The hotel is spectacular on the outside, pretty on the inside and fantastically located. Unfortunately, this is where it stops. We stayed in the old palace building (as opposed to the more recent tower). The rooms and bathrooms were extremely average, just about making the 5-star category, but I wouldn't call them luxury. Service quality was very average, certainly the poorest we received during our tour in India (5 hotels, including a superb stay at another Taj hotel).  Very disappointing all in all."
"This has been my best hotel experience.. Ever!  The Taj Mahal Palace has been on my hotel to do list for years. There was a lot of high expectations and anticipation about staying here and I have to say I am not disappointed. They met and exceeded all my wildest dreams.  The check in was, as expected, seamless, efficient and hospitable.   We had booked the Heritage Rooms and whilst I'm sure the tower rooms are ok, please stay in the heritage wing to soak in the history. The walk to the rooms past beautiful artwork and the stunning internal corridors is a delight in itself.   Our heritage room was luxuriously appointed and the upkeep of the room is great. The room we stayed in isn't large but you don't really want it any bigger. The bathroom is up there with the best I've ever"
"We first visited India over 30 years ago, and the Taj Mahal Palace retains the impeccable standards we recall from that time(*).   We like the Tower bedrooms, with a spacious, but modern comfort.   Room service is excellent, though we took breakfast in the esplanade outside.   The various public rooms are worth exploring, each slightly tucked away and creating its own ambience.   The hotel thus combines a pleasant spaciousness with quieter places for evening relaxation.  Quality of service is personal and excellent throughout, including in-room check-in on arrival.  Ask about the tour of the hotel that is provided at certain times.  (*Charging the full price of the room at time of booking, and charging residents for wifi, are not perhaps consistent with the gentlemanly values of"
"We spent 6 nights there and it was such a wonderful experience This was my 3rd stay. Only problem , the hotel was very fully booked (some girls cricket team). Our mattress was lopsided and although we did complain nothing constructive was done until the last night. They tried turning the mattress around, to no avail!  Inky after 5 nights when I complained again, another bed was brought in for me."
A true 5 star hotel in every way.  Our room faced the Gateway to India simply spectacular.  The room was comfortable and bathroom clean. The staff were excellent in the way the anticipated and met our every need. We were made to feel like celebrities.  The ambience of the foyer was superb and the pool area was simply the best.  Truly on of the best hotels I have stay in throughout my world travels
"This was the first of many Taj properties we stayed at in India during our Abercrombie & Kent tour. While it was not the best, it was, as were the other Taj hotels, noteworthy for the excellent service. (Their laundry service was the best, though, and this bar was set high in India.) Our room (Luxury Grande City View) was in the historic Palace Wing and overlooked the pool and garden – it was a quiet location, most welcome after a long plane ride.  Quiet that is except for the pigeons which constantly flung themselves against the windows throughout the day, so that we felt like we were in a remake of “The Birds.”  The bed was comfortable, but more queen-sized than the supposed king-size. The marble bathroom was a good size, though it had a small glass window into the bedroom, so"
"the history,location and special services provided aa a Taj Club member have the been the best received on this hotel chain, one of the best visited.The staff was so god,that you can expect for better.The inside tour preovided by the hotel explain in a fantastic way the famous history of it.One of the tour stops was the memorial place for the inocent people killed on the terorist attack,and  we was deeply sorry for the victims and the people of India suffering from. The interiors architecture (specially the corridorrs,staircases) it is unbelivble and unique. All over the sevice was excellent and the visit was one to remember for ever."
"When you are in Mumbai, an unmissable program is undoubtedly visit the Taj Mahal hotel as much for its beauty as for its history. The hotel was built in 1903 in the region of Colaba and has hosted from the Beatles to the President Obama. Unfortunately the hotel also had its sad side, having been recently (2008) the scenery of a serious terrorist attack. Since then, security has been strengthened and today, entering the site is as complicated as a airport boarding. But it sure is worth it. There are many dining options on site, including a fantastic grill restaurant (The Zodiac) and exotic food from Japan, China and India. You can also stay in the new Palace wing, but the best choose is the old wing. Ask for a Gateway of India room view. It will be an unforgettable  stay. This is"
"My wife and I stayed in this wonderful hotel twice.  The first time, when we arrived at around 2 a.m., we were told that we had received a triple upgrade to a suite.  Words are not adequate to describe its magnificence.  The second time, we stayed in a deluxe room, which was also wonderful.  Get a room with a seaside view.  It's worth it.  The welcome you receive, the service, the incredible beauty of the public rooms, and the food in all of its restaurants make this one of the best hotels in the world.  Be sure to take the hotel historical and art tours, which are offered at 5 in the afternoon."
"The combination of service, amenities and location make this my only five star rating.  The number of small, thoughtful and extensive service assistance I received from the staff was extraordinary throughout my stay.  And I am nobody compared to the celebrities they have stay.  My arrival was unexpected even though I thought I made internet reservations, but there was never a hesitation by the staff in letting me know I would receive the same rate and that a room was available for me.  They even upgraded my room.  Any question I had was thoroughly answered, and even the referral to a gent's barber shop (I didn't want to use their salon) was cheerfully given (the referral was very good).  The amenities in the room from its cleanliness to the linens, bath items, and little extras"
"This is by far an amazing hotel from the moment you step through the door you are treated like royalty, the staff are truly amazing and the accommodation in the palace wing beautiful, breakfast area has a great view of the bay with excellent service from the staff, you will not be disappointed staying at this exquisite palace."
"The only problem with this hotel is that you don't want to leave. We stayed only a night because we were just in transit through Mumbay but loved every minute. We stayed in the palace wing and had a beautiful room with a view on the Gateway of India. This place has a long history and it shows. The architecture and the interiors are amazing and it is run in a consistent manner with a clear concept of what extraordinary service is. Do take the palace tour if you can, it is worth it. Our guide, the charming Mr. Viren, entertained us with all sorts of interesting stories on the Palace, India and its culture and some of the extraordinary people who have come through the Taj. The breakfast buffet is great, fantastic in fact, but what is really extraordinary is the ambience at the sea"
This a lovely hotel to stay at in Mumbai.  The room servers were excellent; they even made towel animals!  The lobby was beautiful and the breakfast buffet was excellent offering a great variety.  A very good stay overall.
"Enjoyed a 2 night stay in the Palace wing. Hotel is magnificent from the moment you pull into the driveway. We booked a club room, including airport pickup, club lounge access, dinner for 2, breakfast etc which is a great way to experience what the Taj has to offer. We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a suite which was a fantastic room and on our next visit we will certainly be booking this type of room.  The service throughout the hotel was faultless, all the staff were friendly and helpful. We ate in Sea Lounge, Shamiana and Golden Dragon where the food and service were impeccable. The breakfast buffet in Shamiana is extensive and the food quality is fantastic. We went to Golden Dragon for our inclusive dinner and were pleased to see you could eat as much and"
"I stayed for business but spent the weekend with a mix of sightseeing and business meetings. Although most people want a view of Gateway to India consider a suite in the old part of the hotel at the back if you want a quieter room. I can not speak highly enough of the concierge (Glen?) who organized the most informative and thorough guides who showed me more than the normal Lonely Planet recommendations  and made sure my restaurant bookings and meetings were well organized. The complimentary walking tour on Saturday morning of the local area was brilliant. Gym, wireless, breakfast was all good but Starbucks next door to the hotel had better coffee. One improvement - start the lunch service in at least one restaurant at mid-day."
"I stayed at the Taj Palace Hotel (Palace Wing) for a total of seven days, splitting my time on either side of an inland trip to Aurangabad.  Having a bit of an esoteric hobby of staying at historic hotels I was aware of the reputation of the property and anticipating the overall experience.    Check-in:  This was impressive.  After passing through security (strict since the 26/11 attacks), I was ushered to the floor of the Palace Wing and registered for my stay while sitting on a comfortable couch.  All three of my standards for a luxury hotel were met through the process: seamless luggage transfer to my room, a brief tour of the facilities, and unrivaled graciousness.  This would have been impressive enough under any circumstances, but especially so given the fact that I showed"
"The hotel itself is gorgeous, it almost doesnt make you want to go anywhere since eating around the pool is so beautiful. The service is outstanding. Everyone was knowledgeable and helpful. The rooms though, are small. When i saw my deluxe suite, i thought it was a mistake (i still wonder if it was, but they assured me, no, it is deluxe). We arrived late at night and the room was a little underwhelming, but the gorgeous view to the gate of india in the morning totally made up for it!! so i would definitely stay there again.   For comparison, i spent one more night at the Taj land's end and while rooms were far superior and modern (and the indian seafood restaurant was absolutely out of this world) it doesn't have half the personality. So obviously for tourism, stay at Palace,"
"Its was our anniversary and we stayed here. The check in was lousy by the palace reception, just handed the key in the palace lounge and bye. But the palace staff from Kainaz, Melvin and team were just great. Its not necessary to have a sea view palace room just get a palace room so you can enjoy the palace lounge , high tea and cocktails. Its an experience so dont miss it. Very busy hotel and ofcourse expensive like all 5 stars are. Do the palace tour its free. Its in the heart of Colaba so enough shopping and eating places around the hotel Great pool."
"especially for two women sharing the bathroom. The staff and service are impeccable, after all its a Taj. My advise would be to upgrade the room especially if more than one person is staying there. Conveniently located, even with Mumbai traffic."
"Stayed for 3 nights and from the pickup from the airport to leaving it was truly memorable.  The staff from the drivers to the concierge/travel desk to reception to restaurant to poolside, were supremely helpful and genuinely wanted you to have a lovely stay.   They arranged a driver for the day to see the sights, recommended where to go and really took care of you.  12/10  The location next to the stunning Gateway to India is excellent.    The drive to the airport does take a while to go through a city of 18m people!! But you get to see and experience Mumbai on the way :-)  The room and attendant was excellent.    The choices of food in the various restaurants were varied and equally excellent.   The key question is would you stay there again?  - MOST DEFINITELY  Recommend it?"
"Had a great view from our room, staff were very good, especially  at breakfast. Only down side was the carpets leading to room doors from corridor were filthy, not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Apart from that our stay was very good"
"Stayed there for two nights in February in a deluxe room on the 19th Floor. Views were stunning. Staff were excellent. Went to the bar at the Japanese restaurant and found it kinda lacking in atmosphere. Sea Lounge was great for breakfast, snacks and evening drinks. All the staff were superb but a special mention must be given to the staff at Sea Lounge incl the managers Rahul and Farhad. superb service"
"Following other reviewers’ advice, we went for the Palace Wing rather than the Tower. Since we stayed in a suite we had access to the club lounge, which served a nice spread of afternoon delicacies from 3.30 to 5pm and offered both Western and Indian appetizers in the evening. If you  want to go local, try the Indian Merlot from the Sula Vineyards.Hubby also very much enjoyed the tiramisù cocktail that the friendly staff recommended. The only pity was that the atmosphere at the Club suffered a little bit from the lack of an adequate dress code.  As for breakfast, I recommend you try out the beautifully furnished Sea Lounge – with views of the Gateway of India – at least once. Even more atmospheric though was breakfast at the poolside, where the buffet spread was even bigger,"
"Well well well... Really not too sure where to begin this review, other than to say I thought hotels like this must have died out some time ago!  The service we received at the Taj Palace was second to none. The check in experience was a treat in itself, complimentary drinks in the executive lounge, refreshing towels, buffet snacks, personal butler service. Wow.  Our room in the Heritage Wing was gorgeous, and the wonderful staff had decorated it with heart balloons, a 'congratulations' cake, flowers, the works... all for the first night of our honeymoon. It was lovely, and a total surprise! The views from the sixth floor rooms in this wing are spectacular, you look right down onto the Gateway to India, and out onto the fishermans boats - gorgeous. The suite was huge, with a"
"can not fault this hotel , the best hotel i've ever stayed in. staff very fantastic as was the room, only small critcism is the food and drink are very expensive, the tour of the hotel is well worth taking and is free       "
"The Taj Mahal Palace was amazing. The hotel is pure luxury and the staff can't do enough to make sure you enjoy your stay. Mumbai is a great city to visit but, as most places in India, it's tiring to explore and the Taj is an oasis to return to and provides much need relaxation. I would recommend it to anyone who can afford it!"
The checking in always so pleasure experience at Taj.Very courteous staff right from security at gate all the way.Room service food comes piping hot and good choice abd excellent sercice.its always been my preferred hotel in Mumbai and never felt bad about it
"In terms of service this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Every staff member seemed to have the time and patience to go out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. After the first day the waitress at breakfast remembered our names, where we like to sit, even how I have my coffee. Also on the last day my girlfriend has a bad case of delhi belly (in Mumbai :-). On checkout the clerk noticed she was not looking to good and offered us an extra 8 hours in the room free so we could go direct to the airport.    Facilities; the pool is fantastic, a great respite from the hustle of Mumbai. Food is excellent, fine dining, so expect to pay, and the cocktail bar is top notch.  The rooms are a bit dated, but we did not really mind given all the other positives.  It's"
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace as a celebration for my husbands birthday. I had informed the guest services of the occassion earlier and as a special treat they upgraded us! They also arranged for a card and a cake and placed it in our room on the birthday. What fabulous service. Our room overlooked the Gateway of India and the view from the window is unforgettable. The club room that we got upgraded to also ensured that we got a chance to experience the high-tea buffet and the evening cocktail service. The entire hotel is a piece of art and its fun to just walk around and absorb the history. The pool area is lovely too. All the restaurants are a bit expensive and its best to walk around outside the hotel and dine at the nearby Cafe Leopold, Mondegar or cafe Churchill. They"
"Probably some of you have guessed that I was somehow associated with  4chan. Although I now have a job with a formal tag, that 4chan spirit lives on. So here we go. Be in Mumbai for two days to meet a potential senior hire for our Mumbai office. Be lagged on a British Airways flight, no mood to socialise with front office  staff, chauffeur, doorman or security staff. Take reservation mail to front office, be told that I have been bumped to the Taj Palace Wing (ye olde Taj). Eyes open with the light of a hundred Red Bulls; sleep deprivation is forgotten. The winding corridors reek of old world charm, a silent elegance that comes in places of worship. There is some decorative paraphernalia, which to me looks kind of out of place. You only have to look up (I was on the third floor)"
"I first stayed at the Taj in Mumbai 20 years ago. It was special then and remains so today. My wife and I stayed in the modern annexe with a view over the Gateway to India which was spectacular. Its worth staying at the Taj just for that. The hotel is perhaps no better than other top end hotels in terms of service etc, its clean, the beds are great, the staff were attentive. What makes it special is the location, the old building is iconic and the pool area at the back is resonant of a time of style and grandeur. We ate in one of the restaurants and the food was good and reasonably priced. I thought it was worth staying there and yes, I would stay there again."
"Beautiful period hotel but with modern twist. Staff amazing. Facilities wonderful. Food very good but as with any luxury hotel, it is expensive. Great location in the midst of what appears to be chaos and noise!"
"this is my 5th time in mumbai and with taj mahal palace and at level 6 of palace wing. Every time, am please to be here. Staff service is perfect to international standard. rooms are clean, neat and specius, luxury bathroom have all ammenities. in-house food joints are tatry. only some points for improvement. 1. food taste - when ordering in-room dining, pls order spicy food, coz method of food prep is not that great. i've paid INR 8k, even though taste buds not satisfied. 2. minibar charges - not much to taste their but itemised cost is too much. 3. even though, was at L6 room, strange to find that no washroom accessories provided. have to call guest service for things like brush pack n comb.... havent it should be by-default. 4. even this time, welcome fruit basket was"
"We stayed here for two nights on 21/2/2013 as a surprise for my wife .....a late birthday treat.  We stayed in the Palace wing which oozes regal class in aesthetics.  The room (365) was as expected, exceptionally clean, spacious, including luxury bathroom and with all facilities expected.  The sea view is worth every penny especially to see the great gate in front of you.  I would like to thank all staff for their warmth and hospitality.  This hotel pays attention to detail, the food here is excellent too..seekh kebabs by Chef Anand are the best I ever had. Thank you Taj for the little surprise upon our arrival a secret between us that we will treasure forever.  "
"Grand style of hotel with high security.  Choice of restaurants in hotel, but food overall not impressive. Rooms well appointed but not luxurious. Lobby and pool area smart. But main reason for low rating is staff, and dishonesty.  Realised after that reception staff overcharged. There are better hotels in Mumbai."
Very bad service. Rude Staff. Tasteless food. Musty Smell in room. Rotten fruit in minibar. Definately not a hotel I would like to stay. one of the worst trips ever to the city of Mumbai. Overall an horrible experience and would never want to stay in that hotel again
All I can do is add to the many great reviews the hotel has received here on TripAdvisor. The hotel is a truly great building in an enviable location. The staff are of the highest quality.  We stayed in a sea-view club room in the Palace wing and even though it seemed expensive when I made the booking I would not hesitate for a second to book the same room again. The room was spacious and luxurious with a great bathroom. The awe inspiring view of the Gateway of India kept drawing us back to the window throughout the day and night to see how it looked in different light. The pool area is delightful with plenty of sun loungers and the water is a very welcoming temperature. All other areas of the hotel are immaculately kept. Breakfast in the Sea View Lounge was busy but the staff
"Here on business; and exceptionally well looked after. The hotel has great attention to detail; very comfortable rooms, room service as you would expect from a top hotel in India, well designed pool, hugely polite staff with much smiling, and excellent food with plenty of choice. View of the Gateway to India from my room capped it off."
I have not visited Bombay for many years until earlier this month. It was a joy to return to Taj Palace and overall my experience was good. There were some failings which I have included in the post stay requested survey and will not dwell on here until the hotel management has an opportunity to respond. Stay here no matter what and reserve a room in the Palace Wing - it must be one of the greatest experiences in the world of travel!
"My girlfriend and I stayed here for three nights before flying to Sri Lanka. We were recommended to stay here as friends had been before. The service was perfect, really perfect. The staff is amazing. Very friendly and knowledagble staff. Very personal but also cool. I mean, we are 25 and 27 and have good jobs so we can afford luxury hotels. Some Indian staff at restaurants out of the hotel made us feel somewhat uncomfortable as they were ""too"" friendly. The staff at the hotel also ""level"" more with their clients so they shared cool tips and amazing bars, nightclubs and cool and delicious restaurants. Yet, always stayed very professional and polite. Sublime hotel."
"We arrived in Mumbai at almost midnight. Our driver from the hotel was waiting outside  the airport to drive us to the hotel. he was wonderful,pointing out all the sights in the city. Our rooms were ready and beautifully appointed. We were in the palace wing with a view of the pool and outdoor terrace. The service was exceptional. The breakfast buffet was large and varied, with continental food and indian choices. We could have spent half a day there,just eating. Yes, the stay was expensive but, worth it, if just for the historical significance."
"This is an iconic, classical hotel that is a must to visit at least once in your lifetime.Staying here transports you back to a past era of colonial elegance.(Even though I am happy to say those days are past!).   My wife and I actually wanted to visit more to meet the kind of people that work there, because, apparently during the hostage situation last year, many of the hotel staff gave their lives or endangered themselves to help or save the lives of the guests.Meeting people like this was our motivation. We were not disappointed. All the staff, without exception, was gracious,kind, attentive and very professional. The only disappointment for us was the fact that my wife and I had been planning this visit to the hotel as part of a month long visit to Southern India. We had"
"This hotel is simply beautiful. Everyone there was beyond friendly and I loved the blessing you receive upon arrival. The elephant towel in the room, the bed, the bath. My view was of the Gateway was perfect. The fresh flowers throughout the hotel were wonderful."
"we booked the sea facing room just to experience the historical Taj mahal hexperience....  Pros -   - Best Service and professional staff that one can meet  - Great Location and View from Room (one of the best) - VEry warm checkin and my kid was treated as king, he loved the pampering and so do us  Cons -   - Cramped Entrance - Very limited breakfast buffet  - SMall rooms, dated bathrooms  - Small Bed, small for couple and a kid. - Tough to justify the ROI - Little noisy In all, we expected more from this property at this price...I have stayed at almost all the other 5 stars in Mumbai and I found this room not good enough for a family."
I love this place although I have never made it to the Old Wing.  It is such a well-oiled machine with the most amazing staff who go way beyond their duty to make you feel home and welcomed to the old lady.  It's always a treat to arrive here ...
This was my first stay in Mumbai. The Taj was an excellent location to visit the Gateway and Colaba Causeway. The hotel is on a par with any five star elsewhere in the world ....what sets it apart is the fantastic service that you receive here.  They are extremely helpful and always cheerful and ever attentive.  They really made us feel at home. The Sea Lounge has a stunning view of the Gateway and the The Souk restaurant overlooks the harbour. The lobby is great for people watching!
"There are 2 parts to this hotel.  The palace wing and the modern tower block.  We stayed in the palace section in an executive palace suite. The room was absolutely beautiful with views of the water.  Sadly our room was on the side of the hotel so we couldn't see the gateway.  The staff are truly Taj trained and they are all proud to be working for the flagship palace in Mumbai.  As we had an executive suite we were entitled to high tea, cocktails and after dinner drinks together with tea and coffee and soft drinks complimentary. The staff understand and learn your needs and anticipate everything you may require.  We certainly did not spend enough time in this palace and I should love to return. We took breakfast in the sea lounge which was absolutely gorgeous."
"Staying at the Taj Hotel in Mumbai is a must! Stunning hotel with exceptional service. We stayed in the Tower rooms on a high floor overlooking the Gateway to India and each night enjoyed watching the sun go down which was spectacular!  Rooms are beautiful and spacious.  One of the coffee table books in the room had some fabulous indian recipes in it and when i asked at reception where i could purchase the book they had one delivered to me in the room complimentary.  The restaurants in the hotel serve amazing food, we especially loved the afternoon tea with the pianist, we requested a song on our first visit and each time we went the pianist played the song when we entered the restaurant.  Breakfast by the pool each morning was like eating in a little oasis, a great relaxing"
"Mumbai is a little challenging , enjoyable but challenging and I would consider myself a seasoned traveller. The taj palace was a really awesome 'home' to come back to each night - that is even a nice line to be able to write about a hotel - it WAS my home for a few nights. Right , if you can stretch the budget stay in the old wing not the tower - I do think it's like 2 different hotels - old is in this case better ! The old wing gave us access to the club room  The club room staff were truly some of the best hotel staff I have come across.  The shops are good (ESP the shoe shop) and overall I think that without my home I could have viewed Mumbai in even more unsavoury eyes  The room / junior suite was quite exceptionally layer out and let me add a final touch ........ I was"
"This was a return trip to The Taj, our last visit being just before the terrible attacks four years ago.  It was lovely to be back, this time for a week while we watched England v. India Test cricket.  It was a wonderful trip and the Taj became our much loved home during that time.  The service was impeccable, the rooms lovely and well appointed and the communal areas beautiful.  The England cricket team were staying there which was an added bonus, watching them relax in the pool with their families when the cricket had finished. We didn't use the hotel restaurants, preferring to indulge our love of Indian food in the many city restaurants.  We would recommend both Khyber and especially Trishna - try the burnt chilli paneer! The breakfasts at the Taj were very good though, and"
"I would recommend this as a first choice for anyone visiting Mumbai.  If you have a special occasion to celebrate then let them know beforehand, it was my birthday and they had filled the room with ballons, the bed was covered in rose petals, I had a beautiful bunch of flowers and during the course of the weekend I received two full sized chocolate cakes.  The spa and pool are fabulous and the restaurants too.  I'd also like to thank Indrani the Executive Housekeeper and her team for all their help with the purchase of a print we fell in love with.  Whether this is a special romantic trip, a stop on the way somewhere else of even if you live in Mumbai and fancy a night of luxury I cannot recommend The Taj Mahal Palace highly enough.  Thanks to all of you for a wonderful weekend."
We stayed for two days and had a lovely time. The staff are very helfpul without being intrusive and the grounds of the hotel are quite exquisite. The pool provides a wonderful respite from the hectic streets! Highly recommend.
"Stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, was a getaway weekend with my wife. As usualy Taj impresses you from the very moment you step in! The hospitality, service, facilities are just top class!!!! Stay was short and just overnight, however the hotel upgraded us to a Club room with a nice pool view. The breakfast the next morning at the Sea Lounge was one of the best breakfast buffets. Perhaps the only let down was the pool, they need to upgrade it, but i reckon it will not be easy. Would defintely visit again!"
"This is one of my favourite hotels and I welcome an opportunity to revisit. I stayed in the Tower on this visit and once again a great stay, an oasis in Mumbai. Only niggle is the cost of Internet and food/drink, but other than that a hotel that everyone should visit."
"Central to Mumbai's history, and continues to be proud of its past and careful to maintain its quality. Highlights included the pool area, the restaurants and bars - we tried Harbour Bar and Masala Kraft - both recommended.  Shoe shop also worth visiting.  And hotel heritage tour great fun.  Very stylish and comfortable hotel. We would certainly stay there again."
"The Taj is a place of intentional happiness. The good people at the Taj redefine customer service at the beginning of this globally Asian century. And we are not talking about servile sycophants or listless lackeys--we are talking about educated, intelligent and attentive courteous service that goes beyond responsiveness to anticipatory consideration. So let me just say, not only are you ridiculously misinformed if you must stay in the area and miss this gem, but you should make it your plan to stay here not matter where you intend to be on your visit to Mumbai. Go ahead, try it--you won't stay anywhere else in Mumbai once you do."
Staff at Reception desk was attentive and polite. Treated us with respect - not like lowdown tourists.One of them took the time to explain about the mural painted by one of the most famous Indian painters. An afternoon snack at the Sea Lounge restaurant accompanied by a glass of sparkling wine (brut) made from of Nilgiri grown grapes was delicious and reasonably priced for a  high-caliber World Heritage hotel such as this one. Service and food were worthy of its preferred designation.
"For our first trip to India the Taj Palace Mumbai was a great place to start and ease in to the Indian culture.  On arrival the grandeur of the hotel is just incredible, set next to the Gateway of India and harbour it is absolutely stunning. The hotel itself makes one imagine what it must have been like for sailors arriving by boat to greeted by the Gateway and Hotel.  The hotel arranged for a vehicle to meet us at the airport. We were met with icy cold water and cold towels. The van was new and got us safely to the hotel. I think the trip was about an hour in total. On arrival at the hotel we went through a security check point and were greeted by a staff representative who welcomed us to India and the hotel.  We stayed in a basic tower room which was nice and adequate, however"
"It has a very warm hospitable surroundings, staff r co-operative. It is very clean, well maintained heritage structure."
"Great service, amenities, location - everything. Wouldn't choose anywhere else in Mumbai. . The included breakfast.More cost effective to stay in a lower priced palace room and purchase services a la carte.Even room service is a pleasure at this establishment."
My wife and I stayed here recently whilst in India attending a wedding. We got a room upgrade to the original wing and couldn't be happier. Service great without being in your face. Room spotless and every request was met in an efficient and friendly manner. Definitely a hotel we will return to.
"I have have travelled with my wife and son extensively recently for her work, this hotel and its staff offer truly exceptional service service deliver in a very very friendly style. The included breakfast is again varied and of very heigh quality. Even room service is a pleasure at this establishment.   "
"Second stay at the Taj Mahal Palace was as good as the first.  Great service, amenities, location - everything.  Wouldn't choose anywhere else in Mumbai.  However, I'm not sure I'd pay for the club room again - although lovely,  it might be more cost effective to stay in a lower priced palace room and purchase services a la carte. "
We stayed at Taj Mahal Palace for 4 nights and both the rooms and staff were great. The rooms were spacious and they change the sheets every day. The Masala Restaurant was great. They service the rooms twice and supply fresh towels every time.
We praise the excellence of the hotel with its comfortable rooms and rewarding cuisine. The attention of its staff is unique. We found the Taj Mahal Palace the oasis in this bustling city we will certainly return to. We feel equally impressed by the way they settled a slight glitch with the billing.
"We stayed 4 days in this marvellous hotel. Before visiting we have contacted with the concierge,they were very helpful and they made all the restaurant rezervations for us even the impossible ones. We were 27 and they even made the restaurants open before their actual time. We started every day with their smiling faces, I have never seen such care. On breakfast even it was open buffet, I didn't need to stand up from my chair because the waiters, who remembered all my food preferences from the day before, were eager to keep me confy and let the foods come to me. From the grand design of the always pleasantly scented lobby to the beautiful dream-like scene of the poolside, and from the most amazing gym I've ever seen in a hotel to the always polite crew who makes you feel like"
"I have never been to Indian before , but staying at The Taj Palace is just amazing. The service is world class and there is a excellent verity of restaurants available. The pool area again is excellent and offers a very tranquil area to relax and break from the very hot sun!"
Joining my husband on a busy business trip to India it was wonderful to be staying at The Taj again. We were there for 3 days and I must say they've really upped their game with the service. The staff were excellent from checking in to being shown to our exquisite suite on the 7th floor along with all our requirements being dealt with quickly. A treat in India! The pool and area are one of my favourite places to have a swim in an outdoor pool. The sounds of bustling Mumbai in the background you can cool off and relax before hitting the city to soak up more of it's incredible magic. Highly recommend. 
"This hotel is worth every penny. The staff is amazing, the property is beautiful and the breakfast that is included is really, really good! This is most definitely a 5 star experience, if not more. We ate in two of the restaurants they were really good. The high tea is must do. It is a good value and you get to taste a lot of different snacks. The view is fantastic from the tea room."
"If a 6 star rating were possible, this would be it!  Yes, this place is expensive but it's a once-in-a-lifetime pampered experience not to be missed.  Everything from the huge bath towels that wrap all the way around you, the generous bottles of shampoo and conditioner (that you can actually get all the stuff out of), to the really cushy bed, gorgeous marble bathroom, same day laundry service....I could go on and on.  Even the security guards at the main entrance and at the lifts were kind and welcoming.  Let's talk about the staff.  I had a presentation to get ready for a conference.  I was stuck on spread sheets not transferring to my paper.  I was in a huff and my blood pressure was up.  The Business Centre staff to the rescue.  They helped immeasurably with my data for my"
"When I die, this is where I want to go.  No, seriously. Okay, caveats*: we stayed in the Palace wing, and we splurged (splurged - like $400, choke) on a Club room.  That said, if there's any way you can do this, do.  It's amazing.  You can check-in really early and check-outreally late, airport transfers, butler service, high tea, cocktail hour, amazing breakfast - basically you have all of your meals covered (so factor those and the transfer into the cost - it makes a difference)  The rOom is EXQUISITE.  Anything you want, etc. - lie in bathtub and watch tv with your free bottle of wine, blah blah.  bed, pillows all to your specifications, great slippers and robes, great spa, great pool whatever, just do it if you can, you'll see. no buyer's remorse or anything.  pure bliss * i"
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here on Christmas Eve. It is five star for a reason! The service was top class and the facilities excellent. It also has a great location. As this is a major tourist attraction in Mumbai, it is worth staying here, even just for one night to experience one of India's best hotels.  I also highly recommend going on the free heritage tour. The tour guide Niven was absolutely fantastic - so knowledgeable about the hotel and very enthusiastic and passionate."
Very comfortable hotel.  We chose the water view which was really nice.  The room was comfortable.  The breakfast excellent.  The hotel is perfectly located.  Definitely will stay there again when in Mumbai.
"I had gone at The Taj Mahal Palace, to cover the Lakme Press conference and then again for the book launch "" The Glimpse of Empire "" . The book launch was a special occasion as Sir J. R. D. Tata did the unveiling of the book. The ball room of The Taj Palace lit up like Thousand Diwalis , celebrated at once."
"We splurged and spent two nights in the palace side of the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai. It was well worth it for the unique experience of staying in a club room. The service is the best in the world and hotel is true luxury.  At breakfast the waiters brought extra plates for us to sample, we enjoyed sitting poolside in the evening, and having cocktails at the main bar in the lobby. I would certainly splurge again for this unforgettable experience."
its good to have stayed in the one of the oldest and the leading hotels of the world. but the very sense of it does not give the same feeling when you are at the palace property and taking the services of the hotel as the hotel has nothing special to offer to its guests other than the name itself.
"After some wonderful 10 days, my friend and me decided it would be worth to stay one night at the Taj. Of course it was a bit expensive, but worth every penny. Not only were the rooms great, but the whole surrounding and service of this marvelous place were one of the best experiences during our entire trip. We especially enjoyed breakfast at the pool, with lots of fruits and the most attentive staff!"
"My only regret is that we only had one night in this hotel. The room was lovely, the service excellent, nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We ate in the Japanese Restaurant it was superb. I simply can't fault this hotel, it is amazing."
"This is a must stay hotel! Like most of the world, I was transfixed by images of this hotel under siege during the Mumbai terrorist attacks. Thank God the terrorists did not achieve their goal of toppling the dome of this beautiful hotel. After this horrific attack what can be said? What can be said is that the hotel is fully renovated, and no trace of the attacks remain. Security is tight and first-class. We never felt a moments worry in the capable hands of hotel's dedicated staff. A moving memorial to the victims of that attack honours them in the lobby area. Our room, in the Heritage wing, was wonderful. The bathroom is incredible, beds comfy and while we had no view, the inside areas are beautiful.  The pool, which is in the former entrance, is a great spot to wash off the"
"We stayed at the Taj Mumbai in January, my first trip to Mumbai in 35 years.   It was truly a grand experience, and probably the best of several Taj hotels I've stayed at in India.   The location could not be better.  The view from our hotel room was splendid, especially in the morning watching the sunrise over Gateway of India.   The staff were consistently attentive and cheerful, but without being intrusive.   Didn't try the spa, but did have a nice dip in the excellent pool.  Decor, ambience, all just right, so what more can one say.  I wish the poolside lobster grill had a masala spice option.  If that is one's biggest complaint about a hotel, one is obviously very near perfection."
"I have no words to express, the most truly amazing hotel in the world! Everything from the rooms, to the food, the pool and of course the staff! I have never seen such genuine kindness from the brilliant staff that give the hotel such a great reputation! Every staff member makes you feel as if you are the only guest in the hotel! They even looked after me when I was unwell and gave me a comp late check out till 5 and the general manager rang to make sure I was okay! By far the best hotel I have stayed in!"
"Is there a hotel that can surpass the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai? One which can beat the professionalism, insight, service ( globally beyond compare) and most of all warmth and sense of fun by its staff (particularly those managing breakfast, the dining areas and the pool – Eric, Dishar, Raj & Rowan, we miss you) in a setting that mixes modern sophistication with heritage charm (stayed in the palace section).  The hotel is simply the best and as I had the opportunity to visit the splendid Taj Palace in Udaipur, well, clearly the chain operates on a different echelon to its international counterparts. A cross between stepping into a James Bond movie and Tales of the Arabian Nights, the hotel will especially satisfy those who delight in a taste for luxury with a touch of that"
"A memorable experience; the place oozes ambiance, history, class, character! A sunrise at the Taj and the early morning views are dream-like The breakfast served at the garden is a palatial experience The pool stunning, the spa gorgeous, they gym tiny...  Some staff could do better; most are great people but they couldn't manage to make some arrangements after a mistake with bookings (while the Trident, Nariman Point  staff immediately and efficiently did in a similar case), one staff forgot to call me despite my request, another asked me 3 times my room number while I had my breakfast..."
"I wanted to give it 5 stars but we had a few service quibbles, and when you stay in a hotel of this calibre and reputation (not to mention expense) you should not. Pluses : the location is incredible, the rooms, foyer, staircases and facilities generally are first rate and everything you'd expect. Minuses : We were given poor service in a couple of the restaurants, most noticeably by far in the Sealounge, where we were completely ignored by the staff for at least 5 minutes. We went to have a night-cap and maybe a coffee/dessert at about 10.20 PM. The restaurant closes at 11.30. There were maybe 3 tables occupied and at least 15 free. There were 5 or 6 staff wandering casually about and they all studiously ignored our party of 4 as we stood waiting to be seated. We left and I"
"I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel 3 weeks ago for 2 nights, do try for a room in the old building as this has so much more character, the staff were excellent to the point that we felt embarrassed at their care and thoughtfulness, nothing was too much trouble. Our view was over the harbour and facing the Gateway to India, it was our 1st time in India and this was a welcome to remember."
"First time in Mumbai, real hustle bustle city. Arrived on a Sunday, with the streets heaving. This great colonial inspired hotel is right across the way from the Arabian Sea and Gateway to India. The hotel dates from circa 1905, but whilst retaining this great feel, is very much a modern hotel. Whether in the old or new wing, rooms are great, with absolutely first class staff throughout, as you do fine in many Indian hotels.   Breakfast area is clean, with attentive polite staff, and great food. The pool is well situated, and again, you can eat either around the pool or in the cafe style areas between the pool and main buildings. Overall, whether on business, as I was, or pleasure, this is a lovely place to stay and I would recommend."
The Taj Mahal Palace is simply spectacular! It's the only place I was able to find some peace in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Mumbai. We had a sea view room on the rooftop. The room has all amenities. The staff go out of their way to assist you. The breakfast buffet is very nice. But what is not to be missed is definitely Masala Kraft! The Indian restaurant of the hotel. It's the best Indian food I've eaten and I've eaten a LOT of Indian food in my life. The hotel is definitely expensive but if you can afford it this is the place to be in Mumbai.
"This is one of the most elegant hotels in the world, if not the most.  The service from everyone, the butler, reception, concierge, security, waiters, everyone, was perfect.  Everyone understands your needs immediately, never needing to explain things.  You were always greeted with warmth and a genuine smile.  The rooms are generous and well thought out and we stayed in the renovated old wing which is lovely, went to the gym which is excellent and we were offered a complimentary personal stretch class daily and it was great.  Of all the hotels we have stayed in, we have never been offered this service as part of  a wish to pamper guests. Forget staying anywhere else.  This is an experience.  We are going back to spend a much longer time than our 4 days."
"We have stayed at many top Taj properties including the Lake Palace and Rambaugh so we had high expectations of this Taj property and they were fully met! We stayed for 3 nights in the old wing (the Palace wing) and had a beautifully appointed sea facing room. A nice touch was ‘night lighting’ to help navigate the path to the bathroom. The Sea Lounge is the breakfast location with a beautiful sunrise view of the sea; it is bright and comfortable – a great way to start the day. The selection of breakfast foods and service were excellent. The Harbour bar is a sophisticated and lovely space with excellent service but very, very high prices for martinis – that said, they were perfectly made (which is tough to find in India) and the staff recognized us the next night and remembered"
"From the word go, we enjoyed our stay at the ""one and only THE TAJ"", each and every minute. The checkin was done traditionally and efficiently. The staffs were courteous and elegant. The room was well appointed and maintained in its pristine form. Disappointed that we couldnot get a room in the old-wing. Our room was on the upper floor, over looking the historical monument of Gateway of India. To see the boats moored against the sunrise was one of the best way to start the day. Took a nostalgic walk, passing by the Radia Flotilla club, the vintage hotels and guest houses of the Coloba Bandstand, the traditional Irani Restaurants and neatly laid out gardens and old buildings behind the Taj. Enjoyed a sumptuous breakfast near the poolside. There was a legend that the architect who"
"It is definitely a quality hotel. The service is excellant. The staffs are very well mannered and homely.The chinese restaurant The Golden Dragon is a must visit for all. the food is awesome... specially the golden prawn , crab meat...."
"I recently enjoyed a 5 night stay at the Taj Mahal Palace and it was excellent experience all round. Located in the heart of Mumbai, it provides easy access to most major businesses, and it about an hour away from the main airport. The hotel itself is beautiful and maintains the superior standards of all the Taj Hotels group. Whilst I'm not sure Mumbai is the best place to stay in India for a long vacation, the Taj Mahal Palace will certainly make your stay very comfortable indeed. "
This hotel is located in the heart of the city across from the Gateway to India. Superb service and food experiences. The staff is well mannered and very experienced.
this is the best hotel in town and the best place to say n relax I love the food in here the service is also good and the rooms r good and clean...
"This hotel is absolutely wonderful.  The service is first class and the location is near the tourist sites in south Mumbai.  I highly recommend the hotel restaurants.  The only downside, is he beggars/touts know it houses the upper class tourist and are immediately on you the first step you take past security."
"Beautiful hotel - perfect location - decorated with beautiful old furniture and perfect service. Please do book a room facing the Gateway of India (not to be confused with the gate of india which is in Delhi)  Love the inner courtyard / pool area   The place to be if you are happy to spend the money, but it will take you hours to go from the airport to the hotel as it is all the way in the south"
"We stayed for a week at the Taj Mahal, partly on business, mainly on holiday - there is nowhere like it, superb location and the staff are so attentive. It really is a class apart. It is a little noisy at the front palace rooms facing the India Gate but this is India! We asked to be moved to a quiet location and hey presto - all done. Nothing is too much trouble for them. I would always try to stay at a Taj property in India, I stayed at quite a number, they are all outstanding. Staff in the business centre - excellent, there is nothing you cannot get done here. There are a lot of good restaurants a few minutes walk, and taxis are easy to find, right in front of the hotel. It is a 45 minute taxi run to the airport but it is well worth it to stay in such an iconic hotel and the"
I stayed there ..and what more can be memorable than on the anniversary of the most shameful day in Indian History... only to realise it once I went in.  the rooms were amazingly done .. in retro style... cozy and welcoming. the food as usual ... the strength of taj grou... and nothing can beat their hospitality.  The view to the historic gateway of India and the candle lit street filled me as my heart joined the heart of millions of Indian in remembrance of those who paid the price of terrorism that fateful day.
"What a terrific experience! Stayed in the Tower suite at the hotel. Absolutely superb.  The incredible view overlooking the Gateway, the tasteful decor, brilliant food in the restaurants and staff who were faultless in their service.  Nothing was too much. For the most beautiful hotel in India, this is the one! So beautiful!"
The staff in this hotel is just amazing and will go out of their way to make any kind of request the guest have as  their most imp priority.The location is mind blowing and there are plenty of things to do inside and around the hotel.The restaurants are also superb so its has all u will want in an hotel.
"We were very lucky in arriving to stay in the Tower wing only to be told we were to be upgraded to the Palace wing!! Lucky us, though we had booked months ago and were really looking forward to our 2 night stay. Our room was gorgeous, full of character and lovely touches. The flower petals in the bathroom were beautiful. We enjoyed the tour of the hotel and the walking tour of the neighbourhood; both excellent. We enjoyed a super meal in the Souk restaurant; quite quiet but the food was delightful. The pool area was lovely, plenty of recliners and the staff were very helpful. Would we go again; you bet we would!!"
"There is no other hotel in this country to come anywhere near the grandeur, service and pampering. Top class in every department! The flip side is you cannot stay in any other hotel after statying in this property once -  even if you, would come out disappointed!!"
"During my trip to India, I stayed at several highly rated hotels: The Leela Palace in Delhi, the Oberoi Udaivillas, The Imperial in Delhi, and The Taj Mahal Palace.  The only disappointment was the Taj.  Not even in the same league as the other hotels.  Take this review with a grain of salt, as I stayed on the Tower side.  However, given the cost of the room (approximately $330 US), I expected a bit more.  In terms of the aesthetics of the place, have you ever seen a beautiful historic home, where the owner builds an unsightly addition, and then half heartedly renovates the interior with a modern expression that clashes with the original decor?  That's the Taj in a nutshell.  Areas where the period decor is intact are quite lovely (like the outdoor dining area adjacent to the"
"So much has been said and written about this majestic, historic hotel - all of which is true. Taking a trip to Mumbai and not visiting this landmark will leave you wanting. One truly experiences the superb opulence of a royal retreat with all the modcon available. Every inch of this hotel exudes a welcome. Pay a little more and stay in the 'palace wing' - you won't regret it. "
"The hotel is stunning with beautiful interiors, fantastic rooms, great pool area and great staff.  However, when it's busy it is a very disappointing experience.  Breakfast on our first morning was a shambles with no assistance as to which restaurant to go to and when we arrived at one we could not get a seat so tried another and could not get a seat.  We appreciated it was busy but the sense of chaos destroyed the otherwise charming nature of the hotel.  Once into the restaurant for breakfast it took ages to be served, there was very little food and what food they had was rapidly devoured.  The subsequent mornings at breakfast were not quite so busy but the range and quality of food was not up to a five star hotel standard.  In fairness to the staff, they were working very hard"

"Built in 1903, The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai is the flagship hotel of the Taj Hotels, Resorts and Palaces. 560 rooms including 44 suites are situated on the sea front and overlook the majestic Gateway of India or Mumbai’s prime historical and commercial hub. The  accommodation is  a remarkable blend of old-world elegance and modern facilities. Every aspect of our stay will be infused with the trademark hospitality."
Excellent architecture. Indian style furnishings and interiors. Various cuisine restaurants with amazing food. Nice view. Well placed near Gateway of India. Will be surprised when you received with garland and tilak. Memorable experience.
"driving through the traffic on the streets of mumbai is like going through Hell. Cursing the traffic as the vehicle enters the porch of the taj, one forgets the hell which becomes history and i enter a Palace with an excellent ambience and one which makes you forget the travails that I had been through. the doorman wearing an immaculate dress opens the door and after security which is pleasantly very polite and helpful , I enter the lobby and the sight takes my breath away.  So pleasing and beautiful with excellent staff having impeccable manners. Check-in is a warm and delightful experience with a wonderful staff who take pains to make you feel so comfortable that even the comforts of the Home is forgotten. To make things even better, as check-in takes some time, I am taken to"
"Great Location (gateway), great view (ask for the sea facing rooms), excellent service, the best restaurants serving the best food - Wasabi (Japanese), Souk (Mediterranean) and Golden Dragon (Chinese) and of course the Harbour Bar... Do not miss the sumptuous Breakfast The hotel admin and staff really make you feel at home. It has not changed over the years and hopefully would not in the future also. One should stay there to undertsand the term ""Excellence"""
"It is one of the best luxury hotel you can find in town like mumbai. If you can stay in Taj Palace wing nothing like.it, One should not miss you have a beer in Bay View bar and if you are lucky to get sea facing table the evening is unforgettable."
Outstanding hotel. Rooms are fantastic. The guests are pampered for a royal experience. Fantastic food. Just the place to take one back in time and relax. Its an experience one cannot miss if you get an opportunity to indulge in
"the best part about this hotel is that it is""the taj mahal hotel""...just the feeling of staying at this iconic propertyis amazing...the room tariffs are also not very much (plus if you can get some corporate discount, then it's an icing on the cake)...i stayed in the new building but roamed in the old win also...the photos of the celebs that have stayed at the taj are superb...pics like obama, ratan tata...the food was also not bad...the best part is you may even get a chance to encounter any bollywood celeb here."
"my child wanted jet spray in the toilet , there is no jet spary in any of the rooms ,but it was arranged for my child,again we requested our child be with us in the room,same was accepted & further a suite was requested instead of delux room ,we were made comfortable in the dlx room & suite was arranged ,there were many many experiances of hospitality in breakfast ,dinner we were made utmost comftable & that too without extras charged ,even while late check out were requested to have comp high tea session,were touched ,none of the hotels in india ,do take care this way as taj does ,taj is sartaj ..the best hotel in india ...have visisted many hotels but they are too good ,great & the best"
"there are five stars and five stars and Taj Mahal in Mumbai. the charm, efficency the subtle but swift service really floors you. One really felt sad when it was burnt during terror attack but the way it has bounced back is amazing. not to mention the great cuisines you get there.While it is heavy on the pocket worth the visit and you never regret spending"
Outstanding service. Fabulous restaurants - don't miss Wasabi or The Zodiac Grill! Lovely rooms. An oasiis of tranquility in what can be a very hectic city. This is of course an already famous establishment but well deserves its fame. 
We stayed here recently & were overjoyed at the experience. It is a beautiful & opulent looking property well located across from the Gateway & a walk to a multitude of shops & restaurants. Breakfasts were plentiful & rooms well appointed. It made us feel like we had turned back time. Ensure you get a sea view room. 
"I stayed here for 2 nights at the end of a long trip around India.  My boyfriend also stayed with me.  I throughouly enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it to anyone visiting India.  Not only is the hotel a major tourist attraction but the service from the staff is out of this world.  Everything about this hotel was just magic.  The breakfast was great, you could have anything and eveything you wanted.  I also went for high tea which was for the price phenominal!  My boyfriend proposed whilst we were there and the hotel went all out in decorating the bedroom for no extra charge.  I would definately stay here again."
"We visited this hotel but didn't stay here.  The Taj Mahal Palace is definitely worth seeing.  It is in the middle of Coloba - so in the middle of the old tourist section of Mumbai.  It is approx 1 - 1.5 hours from the airport (depending on traffic).  There is the old section (which is fabulous - look at the dining rooms, and the internal stair case), and there is the new section.  I understand that people stay in the new section, which looks like a well run hotel, but does not have the Victorian splendour that the hotel is known for.  Still, the hotel exudes 5 star charm and is a world away from the world out the door!"
"Stayed for NYE.  Of course payed way too much for the hotel party that included as much food and beverage that you could handle.  But I think that is any NYE hotel party.  The lobby was grand and everything that I expected, but there is an overwhelming perfume smell throughout the hotel.  The Sea Lounge had a wonderful buffet breakfast with a great view of the India Gate.  The rooms could definitely use a little updating.  The pool area looked very inviting.  The staff at every turn were wonderful.  This hotel is truly an institution."
We had a great stay at the Taj with great service and help from the staff. Compared to hotel prices in Europe the stay here was not that expensive even if it is at the high end compared to prices in India. The location of the hotel is terrific and we especially enjoyed having our breakfast by the pool and all the friendly and helpful staff.
With all that happened in the past 4-5 years at this hotel with all the terrorism attacks it still stands out in the quality and ambience.   Please do NOT book your hotel with Shefali (in house reservations manager) since she has no  courtesy nor respect for the customer. Neither attempt to get checked in by Priyanka at the front desk. They are not upto the mark and extremely rude and amateur.   Instead when you book make sure you speak with Shagufta Sheikh in the in-house reservations and once you checking at the front desk make sure you see Arzaan in the tower wing or Kane in the Heritage wing. They will enusre your stay is the most pleasant and comforting.   If you can afford try and stay at the heritage wing. Its truly magnificent.   My ratings of a 4 star for this property
Stayed for 2 nights.It was an awesome experience.Staffs are well qualified & offer you kind services.bell boy to Manager.We tried their 5 different type of Restaurant being big foodie and found all set of meal were cooked well with well served. This experience will remain in our memory. They have mid hotel pool which lighten up blue water in night and calm breeze .Oh really relaxing!! Enjoyed our days.! Thank you all.
"This was an outstanding experience. The service was the best we have seen at any hotel. The rooms were comfortable. The restaurants were exquisite. The breakfast buffet was the best ever, as was the high tea buffet in the afternoon. The front desk was very courteous, allowed a late checkout at 4 pm for our flight past midnight. This hotel is an example for what a luxury hotel should be."
"We stayed here during New Years and had a lovely room with a beautiful view of the Gateway to India.  The room itself was well appointed and very comfortable.  Perhaps because it was New Years, there are some issues with noise leaking through the walls, but it is not overly loud. The restaurants were all nice but the shops were a bit overpriced and the staff was a little on the cool side.  The pool area is beautiful and reminiscent of a different era.  The breakfast buffet was extremely busy and as a result, the service was a little slow. but the selection and quality of the food was excellent."
"Even if you do not stay at this grand hotel, you should pop in for your breakfast once. This experience will remain in your memory. The Dosa Massala is a must, you'll love it and they bring it with a smile. Pay for the buffet and stay their for 2 hours relaxing time!"
"I've stayed at both the new and the old heritage wings of the hotel.  While this is a legendary property at an amazing location, the rooms need to be upgraded urgently as they are more likely to be found in a 3 star hotel. The hotel houses decent restaurants but the I'd give the rooms a pass."
"awesome stay here! great rooms, great service... nice and quiet compared to the busy streets in Colaba. check in was quick and efficient. We were leaving early in the morning for our next destination, the hotel had breakfast packed for us to eat at the airport. Room service was great!"
"There are simply not enough words to describe how amazing this place is.  We had been booked into the Tower but were upgraded to the Heritage wing - this is definitely the building to stay in if you like oldly, worldly charm, stunning architecture, beautiful rooms and world class service!  Our cousins were staying in the Tower so we did get to see their room - the Heritage wing is definitely the better place to stay.   We had a 24 hour butler to tend to our every need and everything we asked for was promptly and professionally dealt with. The breakfast is amazing - particularly in the Sea Lounge - nothing is too much trouble for the fabulous staff in there.  Delicious freshly made poached eggs on toast! Our room was on the 2nd floor in the old wing and we could see the Gateway"
"The splendour of this luxury hotel overlooking the Gateway to India and the bay beyond, make it a marvellous place to stay during a visit to Mumbai. With Elephanta Island just a short boat ride away, and the throngs of India only a minute's walk away, it provides a great opportunity to explore Mumbai."
"We stayed here for the New Year's Eve period and enjoyed the experience very much.  The rooms are beautifully appointed and ours overlooked the Gateway to India.  Everything of course is very deluxe about this hotel, from plush bedding to beautiful bathrooms...all very 5*.  Staff are courteous and friendly on arrival.  I'd recommend the heritage tour for guests...1.5hrs of entertainment and a good history experience.  Breakfast is a little chaotic and not so much choice of food.  Service was slow at the poolside restaurant Aquarius.  Buffet food for the new year's eve gala was a little disappointing...but the champagne and atmosphere made up for it!"
Lovely hotel ! Stayed at the old wing.  Room was cosy and beautiful- bed mattress to die for .  Slept like a baby . Service was awesome.  Pool needs to he a heated one specially for a Dec evening swim.  Food at the Golden Dragon( Chinese) was amazing - music was terrible for a new years eve night 31st Dec 2012. One of our companions ran to his room - due to the music driving him crazy. Had to coax him to come down again.  Manager Sreenivasan ( hope I spelt it right ) was very apologetic . Such a nice man. Need more managers ike him . Will definately be back .
"I had a nice stay in this classic hotel, located steps from the Gateway of India. The service is good overall. There is a lovely pool, nice gym and spa. The gym has a steam room and a sauna, and good relaxation facilities. From the Gateway of India, which is also a large public square where people gather for celebrations, one can take boat rides to various places including the Elephanta. There are several nice restaurants in the hotel, so dining options are available. It is also steps from the shopping areas and the water front."
"We stayed here for one night recently and it was in many ways an amazing stay. The hotel itself is iconic, and the view we had from our (19th-floor) room were stunning, especially at sunset over India Gate. I also got what I think was the best massage of my life at the spa. Still, the hotel seems a bit past its prime in some ways, with the room not being as ""fresh"" as it could be. I also had a manicure (in the salon, separate to the  spa) and while the staff were great (and most had been working there for decades which must speak to the management), it wasn't as clean as I would have expected for the Taj (also, there was a pigeon flying around in the salon). Finally, we had brunch there and it was actually really hectic, with lots of staff around, but the buffet itself got quite"
"If you cant afford to stay at the Taj..Its certainly a great place to walk about and an amazing building. Right outside the doors is the Gateway to India and a large square full of tourists and locals hanging out at the seaside. Nice chai and snacks and you will see the rich people and well as the beggars here. Feed the pigeons and have an icecream ..there is always something to see here from Bollywood stars, to fabulous weddings and just us regular folk!"
"The Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai is right next to the hustle and bustle of the business and tourist district of Mumbai.  The gateway to India monument right outside the Taj is a fantastic symbol of the old British imperialism and swarming with people trying to get a photo with the gate in the background.  Noise of people, tourist horses and carts and the never stoping car horns is deafening........................... and then you enter the Taj - the hotel lobby is quiet, tranquil and quite spectacular.  Rooms are very comfortable and quite stylish.  The restaurants are very good value and quality. Shopping in Gucchi, Mont Blanc etc is good if you like designer shopping (I prefer the shops around the corner where you are pestered to buy a small drum by the locals !).  My"
"There is nothing like the Taj service.  The hotel is, of course, absolutely lovely.  We checked in very early in the morning.  Tired and a bit jet lagged, we were warmly greeted and escorted to our room where we were given fresh watermelon juice.  We mentioned that we were thirsty and were brought up several bottles of water.  The room was gorgeous with an mirrored lime green entry way and all amenities of a 5* hotel.  What struck me the most about this hotel was the service.  I came down with a cold and the staff introduced me to an Indian version of a virgin toddy.  In addition, when I was ordering my morning tea with hot milk, the butler noticed my throat was sratchy and also brought honey and lemon.  I was also left a warm robe that day, a departure from the normal style"
"I stayed at the Taj Palace (in the old original building, not the tower) for 1 night with my adult daughters in November 2012, which was a birthday present, so sorry I don't know the price!  We were on the 5th floor with magnificent views over the swimming pool & Mumbai. Staff were helpful, friendly and professional & quality was a key to this hotel.  Apparently the top 2 floors have privileges & your own lounge for free refreshments all day, High tea, Cocktails and a Brandy & Chocolate tasting session (these were set times) They offer a tour of the hotel to tell you it's history, fascinating & well worth 1.5hrs of your time. The guide also offered a tour of the arts in the hotel. Breakfast was amazing with multi national choices.  The pool area was lovely & staff gave you"
"Stayed at the Taj Palace over New Year 2012. Friends had stayed here and recommended it.  I loved it the moment we walked in. A good mix of old colonial and new amenities. Stayed in the Tower, get the highest floor you can because of the constant traffic noise below. And defo get a sea view over the Gateway of India, it's a vey special view to enjoy. Pool area is lovely but shady and busy. Bars are nice and up market. Great martins in the Harbour Bar. The batman and manager are great too. They made our new year celebrations! I highly recommend this hotel for its location, sense of time and place, and its great staff. A true Bombay experience."
"We were in a deluxe sea view room in palace wing. Excellent artwork, old architecture, beautiful and valuable furniture – this place has style! It’s located in a very safe, yet almost all around the clock very busy area, the colonial part of Mumbai. Hotel itself is very (too) crowded.  It were the little things that were not as perfect as they should be, if you claim to be one of the Leading Hotels of the World: Water basin did not empty, wrong naming of different French cheeses at breakfast and some more, etc..  We returned home the second day and our room door was open: They locked it before they have closed it. It seems like nothing is stolen, but anyhow, this is not what you want! Internet access (WIFI in room) is very expensive – should definitely be complimentary on this"
"Everything was great,but worst experience with konduskar travels,so late and staff was too rude,will never choose this travels which I went to goa,bad service,hotel where they stop for dinner that also worst, they show pirated movies on screen."
The Taj in Munbai is worth a visit just for the arcitecture. Its design and all through luxurius interior makes you feel a bit royal. They have exellent service and helps you with everything. Lots of nice restaurants and bars with a beautiful atmosphere. The breakfast at sea lounge with the view of the sunrise and harbour/sea is mandatory. We enjoyed the stay and had a great time.
"We visit the Taj hotel every time we come to Bombay and tea or a snack at the Sea Lounge is always a highlight of our visit. It's a beautiful, calm oasis in the chaos of the city outside, where you can look out onto the beautiful view of the Gateway of India, the boats on the Arabian Sea, sipping tea or maybe a cold coffee whilst listening to the sound of the live pianist. Many of the waiters have been there for years and are always polite and helpful.  This is a romantic place to linger and watch the world go by whilst enjoying food and service of the highest quality. If you come to Bombay be sure to drop by one afternoon."
This is a very nice hotel. Specially the Palace side of the hotel. We had a beautiful room with a view over the Indian Gate. We enjoyed the nice food at the restaurants and the pool as well. Het hotel is within walking distance to the shopping area.
"Wonderful service and a great experience. Only negative was the lack of WIFI free services. This is now a necessity and provided free in even small hotels. Apart from this irritant, the hotel is a great place to stay. Spent Christmas there."
"Had a great time at the Taj Mahal Palace. Fabulous hotel, with great service. Superb spa with steam and sauna (and refreshing lime tea with jagree). Great open swimming pool and top notch restaurants. Superb location to see the gate way to India and lots of street food to sample and good shopping. A great place to visit and I would definitely recommend if you want to have a great experience in Mumbai. I will definitely go again."
"Beautiful building - a real palace. The rooms are spacious and ok. Service is great, staff very polite. Gym ok, friendly personal trainers available. Spa ok, massage was great! Breakfast buffet offers all you are looking for, great variety. The food in the pool side restaurant was poor. The hotel and rooms need to be renovated. The place lags of modern facilities."
This hotel sets the boundaries for a luxury hotel.Service from checkin to checkout is world class.   Im sure there are similar hotels in Mumbai but this experience is one which will bring you back.  Sanchi in reception is awesome..she and the rest treat you with the dignity and respect which all guests should be getting in any hotel.  Rooms are totally cool with great services offered. Room service is exceptionally quick. Food in available restaurants world class.  Simply the best!!!
"The hotel is immaculate and a joy to walk around. There is little point in my review highlighting the splendour of the hotel; the other reviews and pictures already cover this.  Instead I thought I would concentrate on the things you can’t easily learn from a website. Tower vs Palace Wing: This is the first question we asked when booking; especially given the price difference (Palace is significantly more expensive).  The answer is of course Palace Wing, and I have included room tips below to this effect.  We did not stay in the Tower Wing although the rooms and corridors look fine, if a little too much generic five star hotel.  However, we did stay in both types of Palace Wing room; Club and Luxury Grande (again advice below).  Despite its sheer size and grand setting, the"
"Lovely, impressive, magnificent setting at the Gateway to India.  Impeccable service from check-in to check-out.  We were tired but hungry upon arriving after a 15 hour flight, and the restaurant was terrific--with many choices, including a delicious Goan shrimp curry.  Set the standard for the remainder of our trip."
"We are travelers who have been to many wonderful hotels, but this is it!  The old wing of the hotel looks just like you think it should.  Very stately and victorian. The rooms are beautiful and ours looked over the Gateway to India. The food is terrific and it has many restaurants.  We loved the Middle Eastern one in the new wing.  This is truly a deluxe hotel  It is too bad that they now have had to put in so much security to get in, but it is perfectly understandable."
"As 5 star hotels go, this one even pulls it up a notch. The attentive staff, the little touches, I always felt special. I was given a room overlooking the Gate of India. A butler dropped by, to see if I needed anything. I spent Christmas here, and the Christmas Tree, Christmas dinner and children singing carols was special to me, being far from home. I hated leaving...PS- take the free tour of the Taj Hotel with its history. And eat or have a drink near the pool- fabulous! As a side note- I had just left the Oberoi for the Taj Mahal in Mumbai. While the Oberoi was also elegant, there was no sign, no memorial for the 26/11 Terrorist Attack that I could see. At the Taj, the names of the victims are inscribed by the waterfall in the lobby -it almost brings tears... That is class."
"Enough has been written about the location and the building to last a lifetime - its simply wonderful. On top of all of this the service is immaculate. I have stayed for both business and leisure and have been remembered and treated so wonderfully - this is what makes the Taj Mumbai such an iconic place. From the door staff, the check-in, the porters and concierge - they are without fail friendly helpful and charming. Special mention to the porter who helped me in a lost credit card crisis, the wonderful waiter at Aquamarine who made my early evening tipple such a pleasure and the charming  breakfast manager at Sea Lounge. I will be back and back just to see you all. One gripe - the menu at Aquamarine is a little disappointing"
"My friend and I stayed here for one day and were treated like royalty. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out we were well looked after. There is a good variety of restaurants downstairs, the spa is beautiful - please book in advance, gym is well equipped, and location is phenomenal. Stunning space, impeccable service, and luxury at your fingertips."
"It is the small things that matter and leave behind an impression. Which is exactly what Taj has mastered. Right from entry to exit u feel pampered and don't have to remind twice about your preferences. If once you took black coffee without sugar, next time around they will remember. Must visit to experience true hospitality and luxury"
"Stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed it very much.Our room was clean and spacious and had a great view of the Gateway to India. The pool area was clean although sun loungers can be in short supply when hotel is busy, this being partly due to the England cricket team being here.  Breakfast was not quite as good as one  would expect in a hotel of this standard and was somewhat disorganised  although we found it better if you went earlier rarther than later and if you ate  outside .  All staff were helpful at all times"
I stayed at the Taj in early November for 5 nights. The location in next to none....look out to the gateway of India across the water as the sun rises and savor the local delights.....all within walking distance from the hotel. We stayed in the palace wing amidst luxurious surrounds. The staff were lovely and we enjoyed being able to chat and hear their stories. The service was exemplary. Nothing was a problem not that we had any. Breakfast in the sea lounge was a treat and a wonderful way to begin the day. A special place and I will return to pulsating Bombay and stay at the Taj.
"I stayed here for one night, and on our arrival we were greeted with gorgeous flowers and a room upgrade.  The staff are so lovely and helpful, and whilst sitting by the pool in the evening we were waited on hand & foot.  The waiters were so chatty, and kind, and I felt like a princess.   I was really poorly from a previous hotel, and whilst having breakfast the waiters brought me a selection of things to make me feel better, and generally were so eager to make me feel better and ensure I had a wonderful stay; They also printed us off guides for places to visit in the next leg of our trip.  It really was amazing.   I really can't"
"The staff cannot so enough for you. We have never countered such friendliness, helpfulness and such courtesy! Our stay at the Taj Palace is truly a special experience and goes a long way to reinforcing our appreciation of our Indian experience. Thank you and well done ! "
"The room was a little jaded/ worn out (but no tears, smudges on the wall, cracked ceilings/walls, dirty tiles, etc) and all that but one of the best properties I have ever stayed in. The staff and the service levels are exceptionally better than what I have received in various properties of a similar nature. It is a perfect example of exemplary service and they will certainly get my business in the future."
"We arrived at 1:30 a.m., and the staff were exceedingly kind, gracious, and as eager to help as if it were the middle of the day.  From the tuberose leis to the bindhi mark, we immediately realized that this was going to be an experience and not just a hotel stay. We stayed in the historic wing, and recommend it highly.  Yes, there are many groups and many tourists, but there also were beautiful couples at a wedding reception, friendly and helpful restaurant personnel (go to the Sea Lounge - wow!) who even made me a hot toddy when they realized I was rapidly losing my voice.  Try to take the complimentary tour of the palace wing (5 p.m. most days) for a great understanding of some history.  Wander the shopping arcade for a glimpse at a very different segment of Mumbai than one"
We spent one night in the hotel after the long flight from the UK.  With a room looking over the Gateway to India and harbour it had the feeling of always having been like it now is.  Dinner was good but expensive.  Best of all was breakfast.  Buffet breakfasts seem to be the norm everywhere but the Taj has a different take on it - as wide a choice of fare as anyone might want and sited in what felt more like a drawing room than a restaurant. That showed class. It made one feel indulged.
"Luxurious end to our trip. Chilling by the pool. Being massaged. Shopping. Drinking in every single bar. Eating our fill of cream tea, in fact we only drank cocktails, prosecco and ate cake for the whole time we were there and it was perfect. Also great place to settle my dicky tummy. wonderful end to the trip."
"We stayed in the new part, but would have preferred the old. Excellent location and near to all the landmarks. Breakfast was excellent with every choice you could think of. Staff was courteous and all the finishing touches were in place. To top it all the England cricket team were staying there as well as Boris Johnson turning up!"
"We joined the Taj epicure plus plan and got a gift certificate for 1night weekend stay in Mumbai, and we stayed here. I have seen the hotel on many pictures from Mumbai and knew that if I ever went to visit Mumbai I would have to stay here. We had a booking for the lowest category of room, but they upgraded us to the palace wing and gave us access to the loung for tea/coffee etc, The room was very nice and luxurious. Hotel gives you a feeling of transportation back in time. You feel rich like in the old days. The service is very good and you can see that the staff are very experienced. I also had a voucher from the epicure plus plan for half price on lunch buffet, so we went to the Shamiana for lunch. Wow, this was a very extensive buffet with lots of choices and great food. I"
"We've just spent 5 days at the Taj Palace. From the moment we arrived, all the staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Our room had been decorated, a cake and roses left for our wedding anniversary. The concierge was amazing as was the room butler and the room attendant. We found the food in the hotel to be reasonably priced and of good quality. The hotel's location is handy to shopping, sightseeing and walking. The overwhelming plus of this hotel is the Taj brand service. Nothing was too much trouble. From the room,to the bar, the restaurants, the pool, the fitness centre - everything was perfect and everyone was friendly, professional and helpful. Would love to stay there again."
"Spent a weekend here with the family in July 2012. This hotel is one of the best hotels in the world and has won several accolades for it. The restaurants, the service, the staff, amenities, pool, spa, etc are a straight 10/10. The reservation desk team were very kind and uprgaded us to the heritage wing. This hotel has so much history around it and you will need about half a day just to explore the complete hotel. There are several restaurants to choose from and you can even enjoy a drink at the night club which happens to be one of the finest in mumbai."
The Taj Mahal Palace & Tower Hotel is one of my favourite premium food joint in Mumbai.   It has everything going for it. To start with the fantastic location bang opposite the Gateway of India and facing the Arabian Sea.   The heritage wing has the old world charm & class about it while the new tower has all the hallmarks of a modern day premium hotel.  It has many restaurants serving exquisite Indina & international cuisine. The 2 I have been to are the Golden Dragon serving Chinese delicacies & The Zodiac Grill  which serves French delicacies  The service at both the restaurants were impeccable. The staff ever ready to cater to any of your needs - they even had readily available reading glasses with different numbers !  Overall an absolutely fantastic experience
"This hotel easily measures up to the superlative comments heard and written about such a legendary property. The service is impeccable, the atmosphere is unique, and the setting memorable. The restaurants are excellent, too, and the cafe adjacent to the swimming pool is the perfect place to host friends you'd like to invite for a drink or snack."
Staying here was one of the great experiences. Loved the rooms and the restaurants. Great food at Golden Dragin and Shamiana. The best part was experiencing the heritage structure with an amazing sea view. Not to forget to mention about the Taj hospitality which was definitely upto the mark. The only problem is the entrance road being narrow which is the reason your car takes a long time to arrive if you have given it for Valet parking.
We stayed in the Tower which is the 'modern ' extension to the really luxurios Taj Palace which is obviously a lot more expensive. However you easily walk to the Palace and all facilities and restaurants are available to residents of both places. We weren on the 19th floor of the Tower and the views over the harbour were breathtaking. Breakfast choices were amazing and the staff were so attentive and helpful. We ate in the Zodiac Grill on one evening  - far and away our most expensive meal of our holiday - the menu given to my wife had no prices  in it ! Having said that the food and service were absolutely superb. Do have the signature starter of camembert souffle - absolutely divine. They say this has been the signature dish for 23 years ! WE also ate at the Aquarius
"The hotel is beautiful. We asked for a room in the original part, and were not disappointed. We were right up in the roof, overlooking the pool area. The ceiling is gorgeous; all Edwardian woodwork painted in their trademark pistachio green. Service was also wonderful. We didn't realise (sadly) that there is a nightclub in the hotel, otherwise we would have taken a look. We did see some of the guests leaving (and there is no noise at all, by the way), and we have never seen such elegant people in our lives. Westerners simply don't know how to dress glamorously at all by comparison! All that I didn't like was the 'international' feel of the breakfast; I could have been anywhere in the world, but that is only bad in my opinion. Most people would love being able to choose from"
"Where does one start, from the cheuffer driven car at the airport, to the tearful departure, our stay at the ""Taj"" was, to say the least, memorable. After a five week journey throught India, experiencing the wonders of this unique country, we decided to leave India in style, nothing could have prepared us for what was to come. I must say before I go on, that no holiday in India is complete without  a stay in the ""Taj"", it should be compulsory. We booked online, and with that booking I requested airport transfer, it came at a small cost, but started what was to be, a most memorable experience. Limosine, arriving at the front of the Taj, and being greeted personally by the manager, upgrade to the palace wing and being taken to our suite by the manager gave our visit the personal"
"Gorgeous, plush rooms with impeccable service in the centre of the bustling Mumbai, the hotel is gorgeous- we did the tour which made our trip so much more special. Its amazing how the hotel has managed to whip back into shape after the Mumbai bombing. The service was excellent- we checked in early, checked oyt late- at no additional cost. We were sent complimentary cookies and chocolates twice  a day. The view from the room was stunning. I am a Taj hotels convert- Definitely only staying at Taj whenever I can afford it."
"Amidst a flurry of continuous activity, the staff always get it right. Given the importance of this hotel in so many ways, it lives up to its promise of being the flagship of the Taj group. Pricey, but what else would you expect?!"
"We booked a room in the Palace wing for two nights and the room was very good.  The only drawback was the hairdryer that was one of those where you had to keep your finger on the button for it to work and it can take a long time.  It was amazing to look down at the city at night and see the horsedrawn carriages brightly lit negotiating their way without fear through the hectic hooting traffic. In the morning, food is put out for the pigeons on the quay and they flock down in their hundreds to devour it. We booked for the heritage tour organised by Viren and there were supposed to be 12 people on it. However during the tour, Viren was so excited about his topic and making it really interesting with all the facts and figures he had to hand that many more joined in.  Despite there"
"After viewing many TripAdvisor reviews of ""the Taj"", we opted to splurge and stay there.  I have stayed in many outstanding hotels in the past, and the Taj is as fine a place to stay as any.  The service and facilities at the Taj are wonderful; the staff cannot do enough for you. Be sure to take advantage of the hotel's drivers/cars for touring Mumbai.  While taxis are cheap in Mumbia, the traffic and drivers in Mumbai are scary.  Also, hire a hotel car/driver for travel to and from the airport.  The cost may be more, but the security of a hotel driver through the Mumbai traffic is well worth it."
"Aah, what can i say that's not been said before. The service from the moment we booked was exceptional. We were given an early check in at no extra cost, we were delighted with our room. We done the tour of the hotel at 5pm and lasts for 90 minutes; this is a must if you're staying here.  I really don't know what else to say; from the minute we arrived, it was exceptional. Drinks in the harbour bar are a must, breakfast in the sea lounge was to die for. Love, love, love!  If it wasn't for the 10 hour flight I'd go back for a city break. Complete perfection. "
"just returned from 10 nights in the Taj and what a fantastic place this is. Book into this hotel and you will be amazed at the attention to detail. We were upgraded to the palace wing as it was our 37th wedding anniversary. The staff are the most courteous we have experienced, always asking if everything was ok, and could they do anything to assist us.The rooms are wonderful with a butler serving the floor you are staying on.The food and drink in the hotel is good , but as you would expect on the expensive side, but no more than you would pay in the UK. The security as you would expect is high, which is comforting to see.I must say though all the time we were there we did not feel threatened when outside. Had to use the hotel doctor once, for a upset tummy that nothing we"
I visited The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai with my family and it was an amazing experience. The is one of the best 5 Star Hotel. Me and my family really enjoyed and had a very good time. The rooms are very nice and spacy. The service is very nice and quick. The food was awesome.The staff is also very good. There was nothing bad to say. It's an amazing place.
The first room we were taken to was rather musty so we were immediately upgraded to a deluxe room.  We decided to stay another 4 days and the staff graciously gave us the same room for the cost of our original room.  Nice and handy to the main road for shopping and great restaurants. Expensive to eat there but we went out most nights anyway. Amazing staff and a beautiful hotel.  The best beds in all of India!!!
"The classic building, the excellent food and service and above all, the location, as it is bang opposite the Gateway of India.  Several options for food at various restaurants here."
"My daughter & i stayed 2 days in the old wing overlooking the Gateway. The welcome ceremony was nice, even though rather 'rehearsed'. The room felt tired & in need of a make over. On the 2nd day, after a day of sightseeing, we had to ask housekeeping to clean the room it had not been done ! The 'personal buttler' tended to it hurriedly, overlooking to replenish toilet paper, etc.  In the restaurant where the complimentary breakfast was served, one of the waiters tried to serve me burned toast which also had been dropped on the floor ! The coffee was stewed but substituted by fresh when asked.  The upholstery under the canopied area by the swimming pool was worn, stained & generally dirty. One had to approach staff to be served. The menu was of poor quality, expensive & took a"
"We arrived after completing a cruise at 09:30. The check in process did not even require a credit card (we had Pre booked via the cruise company). We provided the information and were soon after seated. The reception staff carried out a ritual wishing us luck and prosperity along with drinks and taking pictures. Soon after they brought us a check in doc to sign and the keys to our room. Yes at 09:30 we had our room.   Located on the 14th floor it was huge, clean, modern and exceeded our expectations.  The hotel provided a taxi service to the international airport for less that $50 and that included a uniformed driver. Again our expectations were exceeded.  Additionally we met the Winning England cricket team and Borris Johnson who was staying at the hotel.  Check out the pool"
"For a luxurious treat at realistic and affordable prices, go no further than the Taj.  After 3 weeks in India, we treated ourselves to a few nights at the Taj and it was worth every cent.  There is really nothing bad that can be said about the Taj, we've stayed in many 5+star hotels and this we agreed, was the most incredible.  We were lucky enough to stay in the Palace wing and the rooms are incredible.  Ours was on level 3 with stunning views of the water and India Gate.  The rooms are classy and stylish, the beds incredible, the bathrooms, beautiful and of course clean, but what really makes the Taj special is the service, and the genuine friendliness of every staff member.  The food is divine, we breakfasted near the pool, ate at the divine lebabnese Souk with equally divine"
"The place to stay if you are in Mumbai. Preferably in the old Palace wing overlooking the ocean. Grand spaces. Great attention to detail. Just got back after a short two night stay. Left one day, without my wallet stuffed with local currency for the trip. Came back to find it tucked away safely in the safe. Loved the oriental lilies in my room, the huge claw footed tub and bed to sleep deep in in. Tray filled with colorful fresh fruit and porcelain dishes brimming with dry fruits was a nice touch. Only improvements I would suggest - better in room coffee (the instant stuff's pretty awful). And, a better blow dryer. Why do hotels that otherwise spare no expense  cheap out on hair dryers...almost every female guest and some male ones use this every morning.  Gym is not amazing,"
"The Taj Mahal Hotel is one of the biggest sights in Mumbai and a spectacular eye-catcher, because the older part of the hotel is just beautiful.Even someone who is not a guest can easily visit the colonial buildings from the inside after having himself and his bags checked at the entrance. The lobby is very impressive, so you shouldn't miss it. I The rooms are very charming. The breakfast is ok. Very beautiful is the restaurant in the gardenw with pure colonial feeling. A very nice place to stay and a nice sight for a short visit."
"If you are thinking of staying here treat yourself to the Old Wing, you will not be disappointed. Colonial charm brought up to date. Faultless on every count. Rooms and bathrooms are luxurious and, needless to say, spotless. Even had my own 'butler'! The old wing restaurant at breakfast is a calm oasis - perfect to gather your thoughts for the day ahead. Food outstanding. I cannot wait to return."
"This iconic hotel, much loved by Mumbai's residents, is in a prime position, right on the waterfront by the Gateway to India.  It serves at least two functions, as a luxury hotel and as a meeting point for throngs of Mumbai socialites, so it is busy and bustling.  We had booked a room in the Palace Wing and were ushered straight to that calmer, more luxurious part of the hotel, past bars, restaurants, designer shops and photos of Mr Tata, the Taj founder, meeting numerous celebs.    Our room was wonderful and had a stunning view of the harbour with lots of ferries and little boats near to the shore and great ocean-going ships further out, and the Gateway to India which always seems to have people milling about.  We could hardly tear ourselves away from the window.  The room was"
"We spent two nights here over the anniversary of the dreadful terrorist massacre that occurred on November 26th. We stayed in one of the sea view rooms, which are part of the separate concierge style rooms within the hotel.  Coming from Canada, the warmth and general mustiness in Mumbai has to be experienced to be appreciated, but once we got over that, everything was tremendous. We didn't arrive until three am due to delays, but we were taken immediately to our room, where the check in formalities we're completed and we were brought a deliciously refreshing pot of tea by Keith, one of the butlers. His attentive service throughout our stay was fabulous, as was every other staff person. The room was extremely comfortable with a great view of the harbor. Cleanliness was great, and"
This is not a hotels for indians or is not a wheel chair friendly hotel. This damn hotel we visited. Has it toilet of the lobby with stair case access moreover it doesn't have any wheelchair friendly toilets. And is just another hotel with tissue paper only in its loos
If your one that like the little extras that make up a luxurious holiday- this hotel is definitely the one for you.  They have 2 wings- the Palace Wing  & the Tower wing.  We got a room at the Palace Wing . It was large room.. tastefully done with a fantastic view of the Gateway of India.The butler was very attentive. The restaurants are great and the pool is really nice.  The whole oomph of the place make it THE place to stay in Mumbai.
"If you are going to Mumbai this is a must stay, however make sure you book the Palace not the Tower, it will be more expensive but worth every penny.  The service is not Leela Palace standard but they are desparate to please  and the surroundings make up for any shortcomings,  Don't even think of staying anywhere else, Mumbai and the Taj are like fish and  chips, not the same on their own."
"Words can't express the joy of my 3 night stay in gorgeous room overlooking the harbour. Attentive friendly staff made me feel welcome & relaxed after a long journey. Don't miss the hotel tour experience with Viren or the spa & massage, breakfast by the pool in fact the whole place is magic including the shopping ."
"Well I may have botched the proposal, as I am being constantly reminded, but I didn't botch the hotel choice. This is a gorgeous hotel, the best I have stayed in as I hav traveled to 51 countries. It was like being royalty. Kind staff. Unparalleled decorating."
"The historic Taj Mahal Palace is a top quality hotel, as one would expect from the Taj Group, in probably the best location in Mumbai opposite the famous Gateway to India monument and within easy walking distance to museums and other sites such as the Victoria railway station. After staying at three smaller Taj hotels where we experienced impeccable friendly service and hospitality, we found the service at this large hotel to be good but understandably less personal. The hotel has a lovely pool area, being an ideal spot to enjoy lunch in a tranquil setting away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We have visited India five times, and the contrast between rich and poor in this area of Mumbai is probably some of the most extreem we have ever seen. Across from this luxurious"
"We stayed in a palace room for the first two nights of our honeymoon. It is an amazing hotel which is beautifully designed, decorated and maintained. THe service is the best we've ever encountered. THe room  was just perfect- so comfortable and quiet. We had a view of the Gateway to India and the sea- which was amazing. The pool area is a great retreat from the noise and chaos of Mumbai- so tranquil. I can't praise this hotel enough and I highly recomend staying there."
"We arrived at 1.30 am due to the flight schedule of Korean Airlines which is an excellent airline.Do not use Akbar Travels of India as soon as you exit Customs. They charged us 2000 Rupees which is unconscianable! Use the pre-paid taxi counter just further down which is much cheaper.We arrived at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai at about 2.30 am. We chose this hotel as we intended to make a statement against terrorism and to acknowledge the Hotel through its reconstruction process.We were met by Prianka Tiwari, the Duty Manager. She is beautiful, efficient, highly professional and empathetic. She saw how tired we were after a 10hr flight and provided us with every comfort until our room was ready. At the heritage wing, we met Mahesh Gudla who was solicitous and friendly.He"
The Taj Palace comes to you like a dream- Do I pinch myself ? Is this all real ? All. I  can say is talking about The Taj Palace one needs to be a Poet - as simple words are not enough to describe the charm- luxury-service - the staff are like silent Angels dealing with anything and everything you need - Nothing is too much in their gracious way attending to all the guest . The Taj Palace has been here on the waters edge  The Gateway to India for 100 years -having seen people from every corner of the world pass threw its doors returning to this magic place as one does returning home ... I can not explain how amazing wonderful the experience is to all who come here. At The Taj Palace Hotel - All I can say is go and see it yourself - You will never forget it !!! 
"Attention to detail, trying to fulfill guests' wishes, service and smiles are the hallmark of this hotel. We could not have felt more welcome than we did at this hotel.  Our arrival was prepared very well, with the check-in not at reception, but being taken to the palace wing and having a seat in a lounge. Then we were taken to our room, which was beautifully appointed. It is a rather traditional design, but executed very well.  Things such as ground beans for making an early morning cup of coffee and having your breakfast in the garden just ordering things from the buffet which are then brought to you by the staff, this is that make this hotel such a pleasure to stay in.  We thoroughly enjoyed being pampered at the poolside, in the restaurants, at reception, everywhere actually"
"Staying at the Taj was an exciting one of experience, that pleasantly met all expectations. It is not a matter of just staying somewhere with the bells and whistles, but instead somewhere with a great history and heritage. Certainly not the ""real"" India... but most impressively an experience that will not be forgotten."
"My friend and I ended a two week tour of Rajasthan with a three night stay in Mumbai at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel.  From the moment our chauffeur picked us up at the airport to the time we left our experience was fantastic.  Our driver asked us if he could point out places of interest on the way to the hotel and gave us more or less a mini city tour.  Without exception, the staff at the hotel from the security team at the front door to the receptionists, the concierges, our housekeeper, the staff in the restaurants as well as the pool staff were courteous, unfailingly helpful and, most importantly, genuinely friendly.  We arrived late after a long day travelling and did not feel like a large meal so ordered some soup and naan bread in the Masala Kraft restaurant.  This is a"
"The 'Taj family' went out of their way to make my birthday trip special with a surprise room decoration, happy birthday wishes and a birthday cake, on top of the outstanding service. Check in was a prompt escort to the palace lounge for a drink while they retrieved our sign in, relaxed and easy. We quite enjoyed the butler service for our floor. Service throughout was attentive without being too obsequious. Nothing was left unattended. The property was spotless and brilliantly decorated for the Diwali festival. Breakfast was inclusive, with both western and indian options, and special requests being readily provided.  Location was great, convenient to monuments and shopping, and we enjoyed harbor views from our room. An amazing place to retreat after we had enough of the streets"
"We have stayed at this historic hotel on many occasions and we love it. Make sure you book to stay in the more expensive but oppulent Palace Wing. It is ceratinly worth every penny.  The hotel has excellent restaurants, and pubs. During the evening you could sit at reception and observe a great atmosphere.   The hotel is a short distance away to Colaba -- so if you enjoy walking and night and experiencing local Indian lifestyle make sure you stroll along Colaba at night.  We plan on staying there again in December"
"The Taj Mahal Palace, I have seen documentaries about this hotel so I was quite excited to get to see it. Maybe that's why, throughout our short stay, I kept on wondering why is this like 'the hotel'?  Hotel's location is very good and I liked the lobby. Check-in was quite fast and we finally got to our room, in the Tower, with a city view. This is apparently the renovated part of the hotel, didn't look new to me. Nothing wrong with it, just didn't look new. I found the room to be rather small. I liked the fact that we had a balcony even if the quality of the mosquito net and of the painting could be better. The pool area is really nice. Probably the best part of the hotel. Had dinner at the Souk and I really liked it. That was a nice surprise as I am usually not very happy with"
Stay in this hotel because you went to Mumbai.  Visit this hotel because you stand up against terrorism and to hear stories which still work and live under its roof.   Eat here if you believe in freedom. Go to this hotel because you should. But then also visit this hotel to understand and experience luxury.
"With it's colonial past but modern decor, the Taj Mahal remains one of India's most classy hotel and never disappoints.  The staff here are unfailingly excellent, while the quality of accommodation and food is exactly as one would hope for from a five star hotel."
"Stayed for 3 days in the Taj Mahal Tower Room overlooking the fascinating Mumbai City and enjoyed every minute of it. WIFI, DVD player, fruit platter, minibar... all you can wish for during a business trip. There is also the palace lounge for cocktails and tea service, a business center, fitness center and the jiva, a luxury spa.  Definitely recommending!"
There really is only one word to describe this hotel...magnificent.   The service is superb. Your every whim is catered for and the staff are delightful. I have stayed at the hotel twice during 2012 - both times in The Palace. The hotel offer a great car service including airport transfers and their lovely drivers keep you entertained if you are in a chatty mood.  It is nice to walk in to a hotel and still be surprised by what is possible if the hotel is well run and the staff really care. The rooms are immaculate and a The Taj is a special little slice of Mumbai's history.
"I am a great lover of the Taj Group of hotels and have enjoyed staying in a number of their properties across the length and breadth of India, including a number of the palace hotels. The Taj Palace Hotel in Mumbai offers visitors to India a wide range of exciting and wonderful features with a superb pool area, a range of terrific restaurants, shops, a small gym area and spa.  The staff from the concierge, the room attendants, the restaurant staff and staff of the Business Centre were all extremely helpful and offered advice on a wide range of matters. If you can, opt to stay in the old wing although having said that the Tower Wing is excellent also.  I would not stay in another hotel in Mumbai!"
Pricey but classy.   This bar has a decent view of the harbour.     The drinks are tasty and varied.  This is a high class bar with some very good appetizers that have an international root but an Indian design.    Veg is available too.  The staff is attentive and the guests range from businessmen to upscale tourists.   The vibe is chilled and the music is light lounge.     This is a good place to unwind after a long day or just catch your breathe before a night out.
This hotel is a great place to stay and is a great place to visit.  Pricey but worth the service and the decor.      The hotel is a part of the Indian history books for many reasons.      The location has some upscale retail stores as well as restaurants and the Harbor Bar to watch the boats come in at night over a nice cocktail.   There is a spa as well as banquet facilities.  You can see the areas that were bombed and restored as well as view the memorial for the guests in the lobby area.
"This is a really magnificent hotel and surely the best place to stay in Mumbai due to the fantastic service and its location in the Colaba district. You can feel the history of the place and it's worth taking the tour - daily at 5pm - to learn more. The hotel is immaculate, the pool area is lovely and food is very good, with an excellent breakfast buffet. The staff are outstanding - nothing too much trouble. We stayed in the Tower Wing and it's worth paying a little extra for a sea view room as you look out over the Gateway of India. The rooms in this section are nice but it's the hotel as a whole that is exceptional. Obviously for all this you pay high prices, especially by Indian standards, but it is worth it."
"From October 19th to 20th I spent one night (unfortunately only one) at Taj Palace in Mumbai. The experience since the beginning was really unforgetable. When I entered the main door there were a lady welcoming me with the tipical sign between the two eyes with the red powder. After this immediately one gentleman ask me the passport and gaving me my key asked onother boy, next to him, to escort me to the lift to go to my room. I booked a deluxe room on the Tower (the building next to the old Palace). The room was very confortable, clean and set for the night (water was on the table). I had my breakfast in the main courtyard outside next to the swimming pool. Very quite and relaxing place. The Hotel is located next to the Indian gate, so very close to one of the most beautiful"
"Just didn't get time to write on this. We traveled to Mumbai after quite sometime and our travel agent had booked 3 different hotels in Mumbai. They said there was a rush and had to adjust between the hotels. In the so called hotel bundle, there were 2 owned by Taj. One was this and the other one was Taj Lands End of which I have already submitted the review.   This hotel shares a marvelous historic area. The overall structure is beautiful. There was heavy checking while doing the check-in - anyone can guess why :) Anyways, the lobby is marvelous with lovely ladies in sarees in the reception area. We were instantly taken to our room and we were also offered the inner Taj membership. The food was good, overall hospitality great. Though we liked the Taj Lands End pool better than"
"Context My husband and I are a young, well travelled, professional couple traveling with a lively toddler. We ae used to staying in many of the chains of hotel and this was the second Taj Hotel we had stayed on on our trip.   Summary Our experience was very mixed - we had a number of issues which were dealt with amazingly when we raised them but these issues should not have arisen in the first place. I have had to give the hotel an average rating despite there being so much that is not average about this hotel!  Room  We received a double upgrade on arrival thanks to having a gold inner circle card (recommended if you are staying in one or more Taj hotels for a few nights) and were put in a corner suite in the Tower (cheaper) side of the hotel. The views were amazing of the"
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in August 2011 and must say it was absolutely fantastic. From the time the hotel chauffeur picked us up at the airport, to the wonderfully warm welcome given by the staff at the lobby, up till the point of checking out, the service has been par excellence.  Although rendered unnecessary by the wonders of internet smartphones, I find it highly commendable and thoughtful of the hotel to have a copy of the front page of your home country's newspapers inserted in your daily news bag together with the local Indian papers.  Also worth highlighting was the housekeeping staff's attentiveness - my colleague had thrown away the toothbrush given (the bristles unfortunately broken away) into the bin; upon her return the same day, the staff had replaced the"
"Stayed in Palace room with view of Gateway of India.  Great room, great view , great service.  Staff made my wife's birthday truly memorable.  High Tea was excellent as was breakfast.  The Restaurant Manager, Mr Farhad Driver, epitomised the outstanding service provided by the staff.  The Tour of the Hotel was very interesting and entertaining. Concierge staff were very helpful confirming onward travel arrangements."
"I have stayed many times at this hotel and I have always enjoyed the stay. Everything that's excellent about the Taj group of hotels can be seen here - the service, the food the interaction of each member of the hotel that one deals with and the desire of each person to try and meet your every desire. It is an expensive hotel but still one that one feels going back to. The Golden Dragon and The Shamiana are places I have eaten at, and I have never been been disappointed. The gym and the pool are again great places to relax or work off steam. The view from the sea facing rooms are always fun and a must ask."
"This is my second stay at the Club Room since July 2011; the room is as expected very good quality, the bed is very comfortable, this time the room is facing closer to the Gateway of India; we arrived by train at Bandra from Jaipur, the chauffeur came to our platform to look for us, I am so glad that he is there because the train station is very messy and signs are not good.  Check in process is done in the room, this time the welcome red wine and chocolate has been removed and the check in staff told us we can go to the Palace Lounge to enjoy the same, included in the room rates are breakfast, High Teas, pre-dinner drinks + canapes, and post-dinner drinks + chocolates.  On the first night, we only did a walk to the Gateway Of India and the surrounding areas; we fully enjoyed"
"First of all, u get a overawed feeling when u enter the rooms....staff is very helpful,..food is great...and above all u get a dazzling view of the harbour and the arabian sea..  Time & money both well spent....Plus the Jag service from the hotels....just too good"
"I stayed in the 19th floor between 5th and 6th November 2012. I did not have any lunch or dinner there but had Breakfast on 6th morning. The quality and variety of the spread was as usually good. But  what touched me most was the exemplary behaviour of one of the Stewards/ Staff at Shamiana. The napkin was not on the table when I started eating. On pointing out, the concerned staff was so apologetic that it really touched me and encouraged me to state that only finest quality of training can only produce such wonderfully trained people who knows how to give you homely comfort away from home. Unfortunately I did not ask his name."
"If you want a taste of India and can afford a little luxury then the taj palace is for you. Make sure you are in the old wing and not the cheaper, rather bland taj tower. It may be cheaper, but heh you might not be this way again.  Situated in the south of Mumbai city in the heart of the tourist, and business part of town, but don't worry about that, this is where you want to be.  Right overlooking the gateway to India, and the boats to elephanta island, you are only a twenty minute walk from the furthest attraction. Surrounded by the best of Mumbai, the hotel won't let you down either. Impeccable service, clean modern 5 star rooms, this hotel could and should be in the top hotels of the world. Sit outside by the pool in peacock rattan chairs drinking gin and tonic, while the"
"We have stayed in Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai from 29.10.2012 to 03.11.2012 in Tower Wing for business purpose. Overall Hospitality is good, It was our 11 th Visit at Taj Mahal Hotel Palace, Mumbai. Further quality of service and Food are not Good in Masala Craft, as earlier, i mean service and quality are deteriorated. As far as other services all good. We feel that due to lack of service in Mumbai hotel rating Taj Mahal palace Hotel gone down to # 2."
"This Iconic Hotel is a must when staying in Mumbai.  The Hotel itself is stunning, beautifully renovated and the staff all do thier work wonderfully, easily approachable and extremly helpful. The rooms are exceptional!!  Very luxurious and every thing you need in them..  I stayed with my 12yr old daughter in a sea view room, watching the comings and going of the gateway and only wished we could have stayed longer.  The pool and bar are great and easily accessible as are the restaurants.  Short walk to Colaba street markets and the famous cafe leopold.   Will definitely stay again..."
"This hotel which once catered to the royalty sets the gold standard in hotels worldwide.  Starting with the driver who picked me up at the airport to the room service attendant, they all showed the results of excellent training.  I'd like to mention a few people - Mr. Shetty, in-room dining manager who tracked me down and met me at the Shamiana to apologize for the poor quality snack in the room, and Mr. Pillai the IT manager and his staff who were very helpful with respect to my internet access.  I also would like to congratulate the hotel on having someone line Ms. Mecy at the Jeeva Spa, who made my aromatherapy experience a memorable one.  Thank you Taj!  No cowardly terrorist act can subdue your spirits -- we will not let that happen!"
"This was maybe my fourth or so stay at the Taj.  I noticed that the elevators, the rooms were a bit tired.  They need renovating.  At first I was thinking...maybe I should have stayed at a different place.  But, let's be honest: this is a special, historic place and the service and location and ""feel"" of staying here makes up for the outdatedness that is slowly creeping up on them."
This hotel is everything that you'd expect.  The staff are incredibly helpful nothing is a hassle and they bend over backwards to make you happy.  The pool area is stunning and a lovely spot to relax and enjoy the sunshine.  Our Tower Room was spotless with a very comfortable bed we even ordered in some complimentary goose down pillows.  We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.
"Stayed in the Taj Tower for about 8 days. It's nice, nothing special. Wi-fi is terrible. TV choices lack a good variety. Staff was great. Visited my boss I'm the Taj Palace which is downright luxurious. Maybe I'm just jealous."
Made my booking through booking.com and  received a great deal. This hotel continues to delight In terms of comfort service and ambience. Spotlessly clean rooms and the comfiest of pillows conspire to give you a great nights sleep. Whilst the breakfasts offer great choice of cusisine the variety of breads on ofer was a personal disappointment no whole meal/ whole grain... The Taj at Nariman point offers freshly baked croissants straight from the oven you can actually see them baking ... here there were few and cold at that. Fresh juices very health but Orange Juice you have to pay for can't understand this...  tea was also disappointing  considering this is India Would have expected a special brew at breakfast.  A must do here is the in house hotel tour where the taj's
"Mumbai is the maddest city I have ever been to! The Taj is an oasis to run back to when after you've dipped your toe into the city. First thing i would recommend is to take advantage of the taxi service if you're coming from Mumbai airport. We only did it on the way back and wish we'd done it on the way there. There is a massive difference in price (R550 for a pre paid airport taxi and R3500 for the hotel one) but it is truly worth it, especially if its your first time in Mumbai. The welcome in the hotel (once you're past security) is out of this world. I'd particularly like to mention Viren D'Sa who went out of his way to help. The personal letter from the hotel manager was a nice touch. We sampled nearly all of the restaurants in the hotel and they were all of a very high"
Upon arrival they upgraded us to the most beautiful suite you can imagine. The hotel is amazing! The interior decoration fabulous! But also service and food are the best! We especially loved the Pool area and garden around it! Having breakfast there is an extra treat. What more can we say about the best hotel we ever stayed.  Safety matters top so you feel very comfortable inside the hotel.
"Needless to say much about the luxury lounges and comfortable rooms. What really impressed me was the excellent service. The check-in service was flawless. The bar waiters were cheerful and professional. Also, as I had to take a flight at 6:30am, I had to do the check-out formalities early at 4:30am. The concierge was really helpful in calling me a taxi to the airport and arranged my breakfast box. Thumbs up!"
"As one of the worlds heritages and India's No. 1 tourist attraction it is a MUST that you go there one day. It is really amazing. Annoying is that ALL native Indians try to squeeze the foreigner's wallets. I don't think about that foreigners have to pay 20x more than Indians. That's fair. But the Tukk Tukk's, rickshaw's, fake tour guides, street dealers try to get their profit out of the situation. They are a bit sticky in from of the castle. If you are in then iit is a wonderful climate and atmosphere even crowded on the weekends. The white marmoreal mausoleum is incredible from outside and from inside. A very good place to make a lot of memorable pictures."
"Best hotel I've ever stayed in.  Absolutely everything is perfect.  Nothing is left undone from the moment you step out of your car.  You are greeted by a Concierge who basically whisks you to your room and checks you in.  I had none of that Front Desk stuff...   Glen (Concierge) was absolutely spot-on.  He remembered my name during the four day stay and was absolutely perfect to deal with.  Glen knows what he is doing, and he is the best at what he does.    The upper floor hotel room was beyond perfect with a spectacular view overlooking the water and India Gate.  Absolutely breathtaking.  Perfect bed with a variety of pillows to suit your choice.  Room service was impeccable.  Morning newspapers, including a photocopy of the 1st page of the major newspaper for your country.  "
"There are no words to describe this hotel, firstly let me start with the check in process. It was smooth, upon arrival we were whisked away to the Palace Lounge where all the check-in formalities were taken care off, whilst this was happening we were offered the choice of either Hot Beverage, Soft Drinks or Juice as part of the welcome drink. Once the check-in procedures were completed, we were ever so kindly shown to our room. Before entering the room, the staff was courteous and asked us if they could click a photograph as a memento for us and for them.  The room, was unbelievable, beautiful high white wooden ceilings, nice colour contrasts and the view was to die for. The room was a corner room, so you had the view of the beautiful Arabian Sea as well as the city view of the"
Rooms are ok but they are not anything like the four seasons or other 5star hotels. The big problem this hotel has is the quality and BO (body odor) of waiters in restaurants - they really have to fix this. I had a waiter serve me salad and I literally had to request distance - that's how bad the BO was.....other staff was very apologetic but honestly this is not something you expect in a 5s property.  The hotel has a good location if you want to be close to the gateway of India but other than that I would not recommend it....
"Note:  This review pertains to the Palace Wing rooms and public areas (not the Tower).  This hotel is absolutely perfect and could teach just about every other hotel I've ever stayed in how to do things right. The public areas are impressive, beautiful and all of the restaurants I tried were very, very good.  The service at the Taj is absolutely top rate. They think of every little thing even before you do.  If anything, it is occasionally over the top but not in an overbearing way (e.g. it's ok, I can carry my own tiny lassi from the breakfast buffet to the table).    The remodeled/restored facility and rooms are exquisite, with every detail thought through.  My room was beautifully decorated, the white marble bathroom like a spa.   Every light switch, furniture placement, etc."
"We were looking forward to our stay here more than anywhere else in india as it has such a good reputation.. i have to say we were a little disapointed.. its nice dont get me wrong but for the price they charge compared to other hotels we had just come from we found it to be a bit dated... We had just come from the the park,new delhi and the marriot in jaipur both which were absolutely incredible... its in a good spot but wished we had booked the marriot after our experience with them in jaipur. The pool was nice, but not really blow away beautiful like the others.. The lobby level has real wow factor, you do feel a million dollars walking through it as its so luxuriously decked out. Which we had in most hotels in india. I have to say the food was absolutely INCREDIBLE in the"
"first time travellers to india, my friends and I wanted an hotel we can trust. we have done alot of research in advance to be on the safe side. The Taj Mahal Palace is the best choice ever in Mumbai. we have read alot of good reviews concerning the hotel but the actual experience is much different. you can not talk about this hotel. the place is just amazing and food is really good. all the employees are too friendly and very helpful. we started asking them for adivce for restuarants and places to go in Mumbai and they where very helpful. if i go back to Mumbai, this will definitly be my choice to go again. i recommend it for everyone.  we have also tried their spa. it was awsome!!!!! we have tried the full body massage and it was the best body massage i have ever had. so"
"Beautiful hotel and excellent service. A real oasis after the hustle and bustle and sheer noise and heat of Mumbai itself. Rooms were wonderful, the whole hotel was very clean. The pool area was relaxing - we were automatically given bottled water and fruit kebabs - and quiet given the chaos around the hotel on the streets.  Recommend the Harbour Bar and also the signature cocktails there - ""from the harbour since 1933"". The meal in the Indian restaurant was excellent and very filling."
"super duper ambience . hospitality services are excellent. great food,  heritage structure , great interiors , in all worth visiting and dining at any of the places inside  . if u come to mumbai dont miss  this place . worth a million dollars"
"a world famous hotel... it's beautiful, it's enchanting, the staff are friendly, but the people staying here are boring. i saw some of the other hotels and there is definitely a trade off between modern and classic. my opinion was (and remains) that the modern isn't terribly exciting... you can get modern in NYC or London or Vegas... if you are going to mumbai for what might be the only time, then i'd definitely recommend sleeping at least one night at the taj mahal palace."
This is a really great hotel. The decor and layout is great with all you could want for business or leisure. The staff are very friendly and helpful. It is expensive but you get what you pay for. Situated right beside the gateway to India it is ideally located for getting around. The concierge are knowledgable and happy to arrange things for you. The business center staff are very helpful. Breakfast in the sea lounge overlooking the sea is delightful.
"My absolute favourite hotel, this is a must stay when you come to Mumbai! The hotel is is filled with history and the amazing landmark is an oportunity to explore an century long story that is closely interwined with the city itself.  Extremely friendly staff wont hesitate to upgrade you if you have stayed a few times, and the poolside restaurants is as pleasant for breakfast as for an afternoon drink. The palace overlooks the Gateway of India and is perfect for both business travellers as for couples trips."
"Absolutely fantastic & beautiful hotel. Such amazing history - both recent and old. Beautiful swimming pool area and excellent restaurants/bars. Fantastic customer service. Had a great view of the Gateway to India from our room. We were treated like special guests from the time we arrived until the time we left ,3 days later. The staff were helpful. We also enjoyed the experience of Ganesh Visarjan during our stay from hotel."
it is always great to stay in taj mahal palace mumbai. the location and the history surrounding this place makes it a fabulous experience. we were upgraded to luxury room in the palace wing which made the stay even better. do not miss the the high tea in the sea lounge even if it means having a very light lunch.
"As the name spell, The Taj Mahal Palace is indeed a hotel with world class hotel. The experience was awesome in regards to Service, Cleanliness, Bed Comfort, assistance .....Cheers to entire staff.We enjoyed the stay at hotel..."
The best thing about staying in Taj Mahal is that you can have a great view of Gateway of India.There was a complimentary free tour of the hotel which was great as we heard the history of the hotel. This trip lasted about 45 minutes and gave good insight into the history of hotel. Remember this is the same hotel which suffered one of the biggest terrorist attack in the history of mankind
"What makes this hotel stand out is the service.  We booked a suite for one night and were collected from the aiport by a chauffeur in a fabulous air-con, wi-fi enabled mercedes, cold towels and cold water.    Upon arrival at the hotel instead of having to wait standing at a desk we were whisked off to a beautiful salon where we relaxed with drinks whilst check-in was completed - blissful (not something I normally say about check-in!).  The staff were, without exception, some of the friendliest, most helpful hotel staff we have ever encountered.  We were going to the Royal Bombay Yacht club for dinner and the concierge offered my husband his spare tie to borrow!  We went to a party one night and got toally lost leaving - the hotel sent us a car immediately and liaised with locals"
We stayed in the old Palace on the 5th floor having been upgraded from the more modern Tower wing. There is a complimentary free tour of the hotel which lasted about 45 minutes and was great as we heard the history of the hotel. The room itself and bathroom were exceptional and all the staff brilliant and helpful.   There is tight security to get in (airport style) the hotel and the roo key is needed to activate the lift to your floor.
This hotel was a highlight of our trip everything was perfect the room was a great size and seriously comfy beds!!   The prices in the hotel are on the expensive side  almost £10 for a single gin and tonic!!! But I suppose you are in the taj after all  but as a splurge it's worth every penny 
"Walking in the Taj from the cacophony and steamy heat of the Mumbai traffic is like walking in to a different world. We had booked a Club Sea View room at the Palace wing and we were in our room within five minutes from arriving. The Palace wing has been completely renovated since the terrorist attack and although I miss the old creaky, quirky rooms of old, I have to admit they have done a good job in retaining the superb style and plush decor of the common areas while at the same time modernising the rooms. Our room had a superb view over the sea and the Gateway to India, with all the usual facilities in a fairly large room and bathroom including a nice entrance hall into the suite. The Club rooms have access to a grand looking club lounge on the ground floor and breakfast is"
"I cannot add anything further about how beautiful this iconic national treasure is. It's the beyond excellent service which rock. The 'old timer' staff who have been working there since the late 70s make my day. The new graduates are also excellent, huge fun and bright as buttons. This is 'shining India' at its best.   I had stayed two weeks earlier in the Palace Wing before going to Kashmir on hoilday. Instead of taking all my luggage to Srinagar and back to Mumbai then London, I left a big bag with my goodies (shopping!) with the Concierge for collection on my return. Two weeks later when I return my bag is automatically brought to my room!   My personal butler Anushka realised I loved the history of the hotel; she left some interesting early photos of the hotel in my room."
"The ultimate treat - a little on the pricey side but worth every single pound/rupee/dollar. The service is second to none; the staff cannot do enough for you and everything is done with a smile and without expectation. A senior member of one the restaurants went out of his way in helping to book an excursion, which included him using his credit card when mine was refused! The hotel interior is amazing, just sitting in the beautiful lobby people watching is an experience. The hotel rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated. It is possible to spend the entire day within the many walls of The Taj; numerous bars, restaurants, shops, pool and a gym. The breakfasts are really something, a countless variety of dishes to suit all palates. All in all a wonderful haven to escape to when"
Very good location Stunning rooms in palace wing Food at breakfast very good Meal in evening very good Service throughout excellent Spa is ok but a little tired and staff a bit casual about cleanliness but a minor point Overall very good indeed and very smart location
"The Taj Mahal Hotel is an Icon dating to 1903, 110 tens old.  Despite the unfortunate terrorist attack a few years ago, of which there are no signs, it is an architectural, historic hotel with elegant finishes and stellar art.  Among the many restaurants (Italian, Middle Eastern, Chinese, Indian and Continental) the Zodiak stands out.  It is as outstanding a Continental restaurant as one would find in London or Paris.  The decor would befit a Pariesian Michelen three star with oak paneled walls and subtle art.  The service is as elegant, subtle but complete, as you might expect.  The food was delicate and sublime, perfect in fact.  The wine list was remarkable, the best I found in India, albeit expensive.  It is an Oasis of western cuisine for those seeking a respit from the"
"hotel no doubt is one of the best property  to experience royalty , luxury & attachment with past at one go. Tower wing do need some renovation regarding the sound proofing in rooms , Room are spacious with comfort written on them . staff is helpful and polite ."
Beautiful and luxurious old world hotel in the best location in Mumbai. The lobby is so elegant and tastefully decorated and the outside seating area by the pool was perfect for relaxing and reading. The bedroom was very quiet and plush. Food and beverages were excellent. I would highly recommend this top class hotel.
"Loved this hotel...the minute you walk into the hotel there is a complete transformation from the hustle and bustle of mumbai to peace!! Rooms are nice...restaurants are great and the hotel breakfast is by far the best i've had anywhere! Hotel extras i.e alcohol, food etc. are a lot more pricier than what you would pay at other five star properties but i guess it comes with the territory!! Would definately stay here again!"
"I'm not a fan of Mumbai but the Taj Mahal Palace is a different story. It is a calm oasis in the middle of chaos. Although expensive, it was still good value for us ( coming from the UK) . The staff are wonderful - from front of house to restroom attendants. Nothing is too much trouble and they seem to take great pride in their work. Our room, on the 14th floor looked out over the Gateway to India. It was large, well equiped and the bed and pillows were fabulously comfortable. We ate in a few of their restaurants and loved the choice of food. Drink prices are through the roof though. $13 for 2 small bottles of water. Be sure to book in for the Hotel History tour that starts at 5pm. It's an hour and a half of fascinating anecdotes, facts and hidden treasures - all delivered by an"
"We flew from Cape Town via Dubai to Mumbai. We were met at the airport by a most friendly driver(arranged pick up privately) The reception at the hotel was efficient, the room was fabulous & was ocean facing. The service in the room was exceptional. The breakfast was out of this world. The staff at the hotel went out of their way to please us. Our driver was at our beck & call , and my wife did lots of shopping at places where tourists nor Bally do not go, thanks to the driver.. The food at the restaurants & the coffee shop was above average. All in all we had a fabulous time."
"This hotel is of course a landmark. Extremely well located. Very striking / imposing to look at. Excellent security. The public areas are spectacular - from reception and the lounge, to the pool area, bar area and restaurant. The bedrooms were sub-standard and most certainly not in line with the look and feel of the rest of the hotel and very average/moderate 4* standard as far as I was concerned. In view of the pricing of the hotel and comparatively to others in the city and 5* hotels in major cities globally I expected much more accommodation wise."
"I spent 6 nights at this Hotel in late August 2012. I'm not sure how to rate this hotel. The quality of services here really varied and I have mixed impressions about Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai. Here's my review:  1.) The room: I stayed in the Taj Tower on 18th floor. The room was comfortable, spacious and well-maintained. The bed was comfortable. The maid was attentive to my request and tried to make everything remarkable. Though the room is carpeted, I did not get allergy as I usually would with other carpeted room. The bathroom is clean and nice. I rate the room 5/5.  2.) Breakfast buffet: was quite disappointing. Low variety and below-average quality of food [withered lettuce, bad bacon, etc]. Staff's service was mixed. The lady with fresh baked croissants was very nice and"
"I stayed here in Oct of 2010 with some co-workers. It truly is a beautiful place, and I would recommend staying here when you are in Mumbai. The price is a little steep, but worth it. It is close to a lot to do such as the Prince of Wales Museum and the Elaphanta Caves."
I have been staying bee for 17 years. This was my first time back for a couple of years. The renovation to the Old Wing post the tragedy has been very well done and was overdue unfortunately. The service is simply outstanding.
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for 2 nights after living and working in Pondicherry for 2 months. We wanted to treat ourselves to some luxury and this was the perfect place for this. We booked a deluxe room in the tower but were upgraded to a suite in the palace wing at no extra charge. The room was exquisite and entitled us to extras - free high tea in the lounge, free cocktail tasting before dinner. It was amazing. The building is wonderful and the service was also impeccable from beginning to end. We had our own butler who checked that everything was always in order. The breakfast is great - a lovely buffet of western and indian food. They also go out of their way to get things for you that they don't actually serve. We ate at 2 of the restaurants in the hotel while we"
"Stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace for our 5th wedding anniversary during last week of August 12. I have stayed in many hotels around the world, but never have seen such courteous staffs, and prompt service yet having the touch of warmth and class! It's a must stay in Mumbai. Special mention deserves the The Harbour bar, and it's signature cocktail, 'From the Harbour since 1933'! All restaurants are excellen. Finally the stunning view of Gate Way of India sums it all up. Thanks Taj or a memorable trip"
"Stayed at the Taj, Colaba, Mumbai for a weekend...excellent service...best staff...hats off to it. The breafast at the shamiana was superb....again the difference is the service....every request of yours is matched by excellent service...the chef went out of the way to may mickey shaped pancake for my 5 year old.....the lunch spread was awsome"
"Taj Mahal hotel is the best hotel I ever stayed so far, everything is perfect. From the moment you arrive , during check in, you can feel the experience. Very ellegant staff, they keep an eye in the details that would make your stay relaxing, actively and will make you want to come back to the hotel after a day of activities in the city. When in Mumbau get the best."
"Coming home to my room at the taj was the most relaxing experience after having had to chase away hawkers, beggars and the sorts. As you arrive you are greeted with the aroma of a India I believe in, sweet and tropical. The breakfast buffet is spectacular with a mix of both western and indian food. You are treated like royalty by the staff who sang happy birthday to me and brought me cake to celebrate. And the colaba market is unbelievably colourful, and its right at your doorstep! BEWARE of the wi-fii and phone charges, i ended up paying 100$! happy traveling!"
Stayed at the Taj in July 2012 for 5 days. Hotel is buzzing with activity yet the old wing where I was staying was quiet. Rooms have been completely re-done and service is excellent with every detail taken care off.
"Didn't stay here, but we went for the hight tea at 3:30 PM at the sea lounge. Incredible food and service. They actually serve (safe) street food with their high tea and it tastes amazing. The staff is very friendly and helpful and explains all the food in detail and serve it up for you!"
"The whole experience was wonderful.  We were upgraded to the Palace Wing.  The decor was wonderful and even the fabric of the cushions was perfect.  Everywhere oozed luxury, but in an understated way that didn't overwhelm.   Our room was fantastic - I had rose petals in my bath.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful.  Treat yourself, if only for one night.  It's worth it."
I have stayed frequently at this Bombay landmark over the last 20 years and am impressed that the usual turnover of managers and staff and the very traumatic terrorist attack have not led to any diminution in the quality of the facilities or the highly personalized service that is the hallmark of this great hotel. The fully renovated Palace wing and the butler service really add to the pleasure of staying at this hotel.
"My dream turned out to be reality, I pinched myself to realise whether or not I'm day dreaming. This is one of my best family vacation experience in last 10 years or more. I stayed in Taj Mahal for 2 nights and had an out of the world experience. Especially since I stayed in the ""Palace Wing"" the experience was rich enough to remember for the rest of my life, I hope.  Any word will fall short unless anybody visits and personally experiences the stay. You'll feel like a king of the palace for the day."
"I stayed at Taj for 4 nights and had an out of the world experience! The hotel is exquisite, rooms opulent, and service that you would love. Many thanks to Vinay Govande, Assistant Front Office Manager for his help during the stay and for personally ensuring my stay was comfortable. He leads from the front, is empowered, personally looks after the guests, and makes quick decisions... hallmark of a great Manager!  Food from Masala Kraft was delicious. Pool, with a regal Taj backfround, was top notch. Spa was awesome! Butler (Amit) and concierge services were very professional and courteous.  Highly recommended; would love to stay there again.  I have stayed at several top notch hotels around the world (including India), and undoubtedly, Taj Mahal Palace would figure WAY up there"
"This is the best Taj hotel and my best experience ever of staying in a hotel, and I've stayed at 7 star hotels in Dubai. The staff are attentive and friendly. I was lucky to be upgraded to the Palace Wing and loved my room and the feeling of history. Enjoyed breakfast in the Sea Lounge where the waiters remembered me each day and brought me my coffee and masala dhosa with big smiles.   Do take the free tour given at 5 pm. The history of the hotel, including the recent tragic attacks, was explained by a funny and charming man. We were then treated to a cup of tea and snacks. It was the icing on the cake.  I love this hotel and would love to go back for a longer stay one day."
Beautiful place loves the ambience coffee shop is super staff is friendly.Would say loved the hospitality of the place compared to any other 5star in mumbai.Hats off to u guysss would love goin to this place again & again
"Our family of 4 stayed in the Taj Palace for 4 days and were very impressed with the high quality service and attention to details. The hotel is well located in Mumbai, the facilities in the hotel were excellent and the staff very kind and polite. We tried several restaurants in the hotel and enjoyed the food in all of them. The Heritage Tour organised in the hotel is well worth doing. This was our first trip to India and we stayed in 3 different Taj Hotels all of them meeting our expectations and beyond. Top 5-starts hotels! Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Mumbai."
"There are several new hotels in Mumbai, but Taj still has the status of  one of the best in Mumbai. The restuarants, hotel rooms  and overall ambiance is superb. The staff are well trained to attend every need of their guests.  No doubt, The Taj Palace is an expensive place to say and eat. But you get the best of everything here.  It is indeed a must visit place once you are in Mumbai.  You can enjoy a sumptuous breakfast in the morning if you are nearby this place.  Many years ago, I visited The Taj to have breakfast. That was my first viist to The Taj reccommended in an India Guide written by a European. Thereafter several trip was made to The Taj. I remember having lunch in The Taj after one month of the terrorists attack. Apollo Bunder is one of the best locaility of Mumbai,"
"After the moslem fundamentalist terrorist attack it is slightly unnerving to stay here. However, the security is substantial and continuous. Rooms are really wonderful- ours overlooking the Gateway to India- and tick all the boxes for a 5-star. Restaurants are 1st class as you would expect. The great surprise is the pool area- what a fabulous little secret it is hidden away behind the main building in a superb tropical garden."
"If you go go Mumbai and you don't choose this hotel - you have missed something. It is a heaven of bliss in this huge city. The Taj has hosted Royalties and celebs - and they treat you the same way. Lucky me got an upgrade to the Palace Wing, pampered with an Ayurveda kit etc etc to get rid of my grumpy mood after the hassle of travelling. It is one of the hotels where I could spend a lifetime. No hotel is perfect but it depends on the flair, the kindness of the staff, the mix of guests and the excellence of the management that let you feel special and at home. Go for a hotel transfer from and to the airport (!!) - choose the Palace Wing, take a massage in the spa: Or go for a Yoga lesson by a certified Satyandanda Yoga teacher. The hotel is in a perfect location in Kolaba:"
"Can't emphasize enough what an amazing service the staff of this hotel provides. Starting from the guard to the host and hostess of the hotel to the reception desk to the cleaning crew, they are all super friendly and polite and always willing to assist you in any way they can. Our flight is at 2:50 am and I wanted to extend my stay here willing to pay for half a day charge but the kind lady at the reception desk extended my stay without charge till 5 pm. In my many years of staying in five stars hotel in United States, not a single hotel's reception staff walked us to our room upon checking in. Every time we inquired about a place, the staff member walked us to the destination instead of giving us the direction. The staff at the Shamiana Restaurant as well as The Sea View"
"It's actually been over a year since I last stayed at this hotel (I've stayed here on two other occasions), but I thought it would be helpful to note to potential travelers to make your booking in the historic Palace Wing.  On my last stay, my new assistant had booked me into a Tower room, and I only discovered things weren't right when I was pointed to a different elevator.  Now, the Tower rooms might have undergone a renovation by now (I do hope so), but the room I was originally checked into (before the staff kindly accommodated my request to switch to the Palace wing) was old and ""3-star"" at best -- a huge disparity to the classy and classic rooms in the Palace wing which is what the hotel's reputation in part rests on.  I have previously also stayed at the Oberoi in Mumbai,"
"In order to atend a wedding, we had no choice but coming to Mumbai during the monsoon season. Therefore it was a relief to find a hotel which takes you away from the damp heat and wetness of the streets. The hotel service was inpeccable, from the airport transfer to the outstanding breakfast buffet, the pool, overall cleanliness and the very high service level. The hotel hosts numerous restaurants, all good, but very pricey. Trying other options in the vicinity of the Taj is thus adviced"
i stayed at their palace wing which is really royale. this hotel has one of the most luxurious hotels in the true sense.  they are perfect in all respect. their staff are the most helpful and extremely resourceful. their lobby is GRAND. the rooms are great. food is excellent. i say it will be very difficult to find fault with this hotel.
"We decided to stay at the Taj Palace on a complete whim since both me and my partner live in the suburbs in Mumbai and always wanted to stay downtown. Known as the ultimate in 5-star luxury, our expectations from the place were sky-high. And must say, the hotel lived up to it's name and how!  The Taj Palace Mumbai definitely has the best looking hotel lobby in the city, I believe they're the only ones to have a Husein at the reception. That apart, the entire Palace wing of the hotel will transport you into this other world. I really felt like a royal amidst a strong sense on history.  I loved the carpets, the old regal chandeliers, the paintings, the flowers, everything about this place spells class and luxury. Also- must mention, this hotel had the best staff we've ever"
"Pure majestic and luxury in the hear of the sea. Lovely furnishing, layout, excellent service and was welcomed with a smile. The only problem is that its in the middle of nowhere and unless one wants to stay indoors all day (which is very tempting), its far off some of the main office and tourism areas.  However, its a must to visit this place, even if to step in for awhile for a meal as its way beyond most luxury hotels; it offers royalty service 24/7. A must go when in Mumbai!"
"I would say that amongst all the hotels that i have stayed at in Mumbai the Taj Mahal Colaba would be rated at pole position on my list.  The front desk and concierge are extremely cooperative, warm and welcoming. It being my b'day was made special all the more by almost every staff wishing me for the day.  We were staying on the 17th floor of the hotel with the Gateway of India view. The gateway view gives a view of the Arabian Sea as well. The view is simply stunning especially at night with the city lights. So ask for the highest level of rooms with the gateway view!  The spa called Jiva has by far been the most relaxing ever! Very courteous and professional masseurs will ask your exact pressure areas, where u feel extra attention to be paid. For me it was my back and OMG it"
"I was a postgraduate research student here in Mumbai, so know the city really well and must advise although this hotel is magnificent please get out and see the real Mumbai, a hub of noise, activity and inexpensive yet amazing restaurants. I stayed here when my parents came over the visit. Don’t be afraid to go off the beaten track! First thing to learn, blue taxis have air-conditioning whilst the yellow and black ones do not and ALWAYS agree a price with the driver before you get in! If taking a rickshaw, each rickshaw is fixed with a meter, do not pay more than the meter says. You can pick up meter price guides easily, mine was provided when I arrive on campus. Also products such as bottled water have a price printed onto them, usually in small white print above the bottle"
"- Best location in Mumbai.  - Awesome pool area.  - It is a magnificent building, a place worthy of being visited if one does not stay in it.  - Good spa.  - Fantastic restaurants (Chinese and Japanese are both exceptional).  - Rooms are very nice in the Palace (not seen the Tower), although can be very different from one another. I had a huge room but I saw the inside of two other rooms and they were half the size (still very nice).  - Very good service, for India. Far less erratic, slow, and overbearing than anywhere else I have stayed in the country (I go to India four times a year and I do have a problem with service there, but that's a different topic). This hotel has the best service I have experienced in India so far, over a sample of 15 five-star hotels or so I have been"
"The Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai, opposite the Gateway of India,  is a renowned place for its highest standards of service.  It has continued to maintain its standards---when I stayed at the hotel after a gap of about a year.    Even the used show is returned in a new nice cloth bag after it is shined---and they readily provided---with their compliments ! -- a new set of batteries for my camera when I asked for directions to a shop to buy these !    For the buffet breakfast, the coffee-shop at the ground level   has a better range and is faster--though the one at the first floor --overlooking the Sea and the Gateway is more romantic, historic and leisurely !  The interiors have been exceptionally done up---and their guided heritage walk around the Hotel in the evenings is something"
"We stayed there for two days... The Best in India..  Fantastic views from the room above the Iconic Gateway of India with sea breeze, sound of waves and good views...  Best palatial corridors and plenty of meeting rooms, restaurants and what not....  The only disadvantage we are feeling as in most Indian hotels is lack of free internet.. Can't understand why this is so, in a technologically advanced India, where even labourers have started checking mails and booking movie seats thru' net.. I feel the Indian hotel industry must start acting on this..."
"Different from regular indian hotels: Clean, fantastic and very, very expensive. But considering that is a milestone or a landmark in India, fully approved"
"what a place, steeped in history and now more so, with the terror attack. The BALL ROOM is awesome, fantastically decorated and if you are in the corridor outside the ball room, the view of the gateway of inida is fantastic. the view of the sea and the ships moving is fantastic. The main lobby is huge and very comfy. The stores - like - Mont Blanc, are great. There is always a great BUZZ. While you walk towards the old side, to the Ball Room or the Crystal etc, you can see a lot of old photographs, well lit, on the right side wall. Very Charming and makes you feel the history of the place. When you dont take the lift to go to the conference halls / the ball room - you go via the Main Staircase, well carpeted and alluring.

"If you are visiting India then the Taj Mahal Palace is a MUST.  This is the best hotel I have stayed at.  What can i say, The Welcome was unbelievable, the rooms are spacious and have everything you need, including international adapters, the staff are truly amazing from the room attendant to the concierge and nothing is too much trouble,  The hotel is magificent right down to the last detail.  You will be treated like Royality from the moment you arrive to the time you departure, but you will not want to leave.  I truly recommend this hotel you will not be disappointed."
"I Can't even forget the single second of my stay at Taj Mahel place. Wow What a great hotel it is. Each and every things are superb and service to front desk, housekeeping to laundry is called one hotel in Mumbai nice sea view with big rooms. Must visit ones in life time guys.... and feel enjoyment of royal life style..."
"For people who have peeped into the South Asian kingdom culture and managed to catch enough glimpses through the movies, think about living it. The wide reception area would be the court hall with concierge greeting you to the Old Taj to the left and new Towers to the right. Since the Old taj rooms are quite expensive compared to the Towers, you are always allowed to catch a glimpse of the famous renovated Grand Staircase re-opened by Ratan Tata himself after the Mumbai shootout. Leaving alone the extravagance of architecture which we can go laurels and not stop, the breakfast just deserves the equal praise. With a spread covering knowingly or unknowingly covering over 10 cuisines, there is nothing more one can ask for except a grandous appetite."
"Unlike other five star hotels, we find the Taj just makes it so easy. We are a family of five (three young children) so are always faced with the uncertainties of whether to book one suite with two rooms or two interconnecting rooms. Usually, the websites don't cover this anomaly, so we need to ring or email the hotel directly. This always seems to be too hard for many hotels. Anyway, the Taj were great in helping us chose the best option for us which was 2 interconnecting rooms in the Tower. As it was our first time to Mumbai, we arranged an airport pickup (which was fantastic) and were greeted at the hotel by a very helpful young lady who took us directly to our rooms (no check in required). To our surprise, we were upgraded to the Palace sea view rooms which overlooked the"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is a hotel in which I would be delighted to stay in again.     My room was in the palace and I must say it was excellent. The room was quite large with an foyer connecting to the bathroom and the room with a desk area and a large bed. All of the space was put to good use with amenities hiding in every drawer. The bathroom itself was wonderous, outifitted almost entirely in marble. The room overall was a pleasant area to spend time and there was never a minute I spent there not thinking that I was being spoiled.      The rest of the hotel was just as nice with a fantastic pool and a lobby with flower arrangements that never ceased to amaze me. The sea lounge is on the first floor and is where I had my breakfast every morning, it was very good for providing"
"I was recently back in Mumbai for personal reasons, and stayed at this unique hotel again.  I had requested a room in the palace section, not to be snobbish, but if you're staying here, you might as well go all out. I didn't get to stay in one of the lavish suites like I did last time, but the service is as good as it is everywhere else.  My only comment would be the so called ""palace service"" (or one touch at e.g. Hilton) which often did not respond when I called and needed help. But when I got through (on a second or third attempt), the service was impeccable, friendly and highly efficient. E.g. when I asked for some bath salt, I was treated to a tray with at least 7 or 8 different varieties to try out.  The Taj also hosts a particular department called ""guest experiences"""
"Great location next to gateway of india, take ferry to elephanta islands or alibaug. Taj has an excellent patiserrie, moroccan and Indian restaurants. Morimotos is also great. Rooms are small but have a great sea view."
"Perhaps the most elegant hotel in the world.  We had enjoyed 3 nights in a Harbor Suite.  The room was spacious, spotless and well appointed.   It also allowed us Club Level access, which we only utilized for breakfast.   The breakfast service was very slow, as they seemed to be running into each other."
"This is the most beautiful hotel in Mumbai.....She is the uncrowned queen of Mumbai....Having stayed at The towers and the Palace wing i highly recommend the Palace wing...Ive walked on the cantilever carpeted steps for years but even today i'm spellbound and crane my neck upwards to admire the dome....The dome which stood strong against all odds....Its the spirit of the people of Mumbai .....I love the rich history of the Taj ....i love the very sentiment for erecting this magnificent hotel....For me its a little museum in my Mumbai.....  The rooms of Palace are beautiful...We stayed in their executive suite, it was beautiful...Don;t miss the Victorian Bath....  I'm a huge fan of the Asian High Tea at sea lounge, golden dragon (best chinese in Mumbai), wasabi (best Japanese in"
"All the legends of India in one place only. As you enter the old wing, the magnificent hall makes you feel it. Lavishly decorated with marble and inlays, at every corner you will feel the sense of perfection. The superb annex arcade is worth some walking, just to see the rivers of handicrafted fabrics and luxury items in the finest and spotless shop windows ever seen.Don't miss the bookshop, very well provided of international press and where the ancient shelves' wooden smell will make your browsing like a trip backwards in nineteen hundreds...and if you are so lucky to make the ""Taj"" your place to stay,you will rest in heavenly comfort, shiny marblework, very well planned furniture and space interaction, and a breathtaking view on the bay. This place should be listed among this"
The architecture is very nice. And the accomodation at the hotel is very nice. Their security system is very good. The service at the hotel is very good. And i can say hates off to tata..........................
"Fabulous is too small a word to  describe the wonderful hotel experience I had at Taj. Right from check in to check out, the time spent at the hotel was simply amazing.. The staff were courteous, smiling, always proactive to serve and above all had fantastic memory, the waiters would remember my preference on breakfast, remembered my name and even tried to save my favourite table on all days..   Not one of the cheapest hotels around yet a stay at the Taj Mahal Palace is surely an experience everyone should try to get, at least once, if not more. The palace wing of the hotel is where one should stay as there are quite a few exclusives for palace guests..  The buffet breakfast had very good spread with multiple choices available, we were also treated to the complimentary evening"
Very good hotel with excellent service and Hospitality. Locked in one the prime location see facing room are wonderful. Services are world class and magnificent food the gives real pleasure and satisfaction. This place defines the legacy of Taj and India.
We found it really hard to leave this place even after only three nights in the Tower wing. I felt we got the same exceptional service that we would have got in the Palace wing. It really was amazingly good. The view of the Gateway of India was worth paying for. The breakfast was one of the best with plenty of western and Indian options. The pool was also one if the best hotel pools I've experienced. Take the Heritage Tour. It was way more entertaining than I imagined it would be. Enjoy tea under the swishing ceiling fans and a cocktail or two in the Harbour Bar. This place is an institution and it deserves it's legendary status. We'll be back for sure.
"We arrived late into Bombay from a long journey from the US. Upon check-in! The wonderful staff upgraded us to the old wing into one of the best rooms I have ever seen - beautiful marble throughout, shower and tub, view of the ocean, perfect bed, etc. The staff went above and beyond all of our expectations, from cakes to balloons to special meals! The pool is an excellent retreat from the constant sounds and smells of Bombay. I highly recommend staying here and in particular the Old Wing. The only negative is the amount of security, but it is understandable."
Fab hotel! Service was Just perfect And beautiful rooms. 
"After a lot of deliberation, my to-be wife and I decided to book one of the suites at the Taj Mahal Palace for our wedding night. We arrived late at night, after an exhausting wedding day. To our relief, check-in took less than five minutes and the staff were smiling even at that late hour.  The staff had put in extra effort to decorate the room with balloons, rose petals and other items for our wedding night. They had also put a complementary bottle of wine and a cake as part of the package. Shortly after we entered the room, our butler came in to explain the features of the room. He seemed unaware that it was a newlywed couple, or good sense would have prevailed and he would not have showed up in the first place. Anyways, there were no further interruptions.   The room was"
"Right from the time we checked in and were told that we had been upgraded to a Palace wing room till the time we checked out, it was sublime. At reception service was personalised upto being garlanded with Marigolds and getting an ""arti"" and tikka"". The room was breath taking to say the least. Not for nothing is it rated amongst the leading hotels of the world!! The staff was fantastic. Special mention to Viren who took us on a tour of this hotel which is so steeped in history.There is a dedicated lounge for guests in this wing where you can have coffee or tea 24/7 and snack in the evening, all complimentary. They were kind enough to make me a special brew to ease my sore throat.A must stay in hotel for a once in a life time experience."
"The ultimate in luxury, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai is definitely the best hotel in the city! Having recovered from the murderous terror attacks that took place two years ago, it has been restored brilliantly and is back with a bang. We stayed in the Bell Tower Suite for our 20th wedding anniversary & it was the last word in gracious living...brilliant locale with service being out of this world..the butler service sor our suite was prompt & friendly. The food in every restaurant is excellent. No complaints at all."
"Great Experience , Its difficult to express , one needs to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace - Mumbai to experience the Taj Hospitality .  Great heritage hotel , rated best among the top hotels of the world . Great Sea View and view of Gate way of India from the Sea facing rooms . Taj Courtesy & Hospitality is Incomparable."
"Enjoyable stay- nice accomodations, while feeling the culture of India. Favorite part was riding elephant a half block from hotel.  Gorgeous view.  Will always be my choice in Mumbai."
"Exquisite architecture and styling. Elegance all around, inside and out. Staff is extremely polite and attentive, almost to the point of being intrusive. Rooms are opulently appointed and everything is extremely functional and of high quality. On-site restaurants had a sufficient variety of food selections for those who don't venture out to local establishments. Location is exceptional, being right across the street from the Gateway to India. A truly pleasant experience!"
"during the rains i got out of the lift holding an expensive gold item. there was water in the lobby right outside the lift, i slipped and broke the gold item. taj staff dint ask for any help i twisted my ankle and walked and nobody bothered to ask! otherwise its a good hotel, not a family place. good for business trips!"
"I had gone to this hotel for attending the Windows 8 Hackathon in May. The hotel is splendid. I was mesmerized by its beauty and cleanliness. And the hotel staff is very accommodating and helpful. The hotel is so big that one can get lost in it too. At each and every turn, there are people to guide you in case of any emergency. Looking forward to staying in the hotel on further visits."
"From the welcome as you step through the doors of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, to the quick check in procedure and swift passage to your room, the Taj staff really do personify experience and excellence. Great food, albeit expensive in the hotel, but the location is prime with a multitude of excellent (and much more reasonable) restaurants nearby, which do not charge the Luxury Tax that 5 star hotels are obliged to. Perfect for tourists seeking an excellent luxury base from which to explore South Mumbai, to business people seeking a prime location and amenities for every need. An excellent pool and spa also!"
"The best hotel I have ever stayed in...and I have stayed in quite in few both in India and abroad....it's the best Taj property as well.  Everything from the reception to the bell desk service to the rooms and the minute attention to all details and needs of ours were taken care of and addressed to. Something which I greatly appreciate. Even if they couldn't solve our query, they came back with an apology and it was prompt and courteous with suggested alternatives.  The food was awesome as well in all the restaurants.  Overall, a grand and fulfilling experience."
"We booked this hotel for our weeklong stay and it was a memorable one. My birthday fell during the stay in the hotel and must say they really made the day a special one, a nice cake, flowers and a special spa :). Located in south mumbai, it is just 5 mins walk from colaba market, marine drive is also nearby. Step out of the hotel n you see Gateway of India. Has very good restaurants, a must try is 'Souk', it serves Mediterranean cusine and a good one."
The Taj family. The place. The warmth. The feeling is something else. The restaurants are top notch. The rooms are homes. The friendly staff just makes up for every moment spent. The Taj experience is something to take back home. And it is one of Mumbai's and India's finest export.
"Even if like me you have to save to spend only one night in this beautiful hotel - it is a must.  The building is beautiful, the staff incredibly attentive and the rooms sumptuious.  Checking in in the ""heritage side "" of the hotel is an experience in it's own right - the lovley black and white floor tiles, the incredible chandelier,  the glass of bubbles whilst you wait ... 7 star is more like it. Treat yourself it is well worth it. Incredible India! A drink on the patio at the pool or afternoon tea .. nohting but a charming experience."
"The taj mahal palace is excellent service providing hotel in maharashtra. Hotel place,rooms & suites,service,food etc very good.I have suggest my friend one time stay in hotel taj mahal palace in mumbai."
Spent 2 nights at the Tower Wing. The rooms are standard Hotel room which seems dated for such an iconic hotel and needs to be renovated. Buffet Breakfast was very good at the Shamiana and the service throughout the hotel is excellent. Hotel restaurants are excellent too but quality of food in Room service could improve though. Hope they renovate the rooms shortly.
"Staying in this hotel is an experience in itself. The elegance,history and luxury of this hotel is unique and unparalleled. Stayed here on several occasions and each and every time I have had a good stay."
"Staying at the Taj Mahal Palace and Towers in Mumbai is no joke. But the best thing to do is ask for a sea facing room, it does'nt matter what floor you're on. The view is just amazing. Not a single thing to complain about. So many options for fine dining. Wasabi, Zodiac Grill, Soux, Shamiana, Sea Lounge...the list is never ending. Cheers !"
"Stayed 2 nights and the Taj Innercircle card gave access to their lovely lounge. The hotel interiors has changed completely as compared to last time I stayed there in 2006. Staff though not very courteuos but yes the innercircle desk is quite efficient and pleasant. The rooms are great with huge bath tub, 42 inches LCD. The barbecue next to the pool is amazing. Jiva's spa experience not very good :("
"Went there for a business conference and was spellbound by the view. On the 20th floor you have this conference room that is the corner room. It has an unparalleled view of Mumbai. You see Gateway of India and the sea with the many ships.   There is a restaurant called 'Souk' on the same floor and you should eat there in the evening just for the view. Please do note that it opens only from 12:30 PM to 2:45 PM and 7 PM to 11:45 PM. It serves Mediterranean cuisine  and will approx cost you Rs. 3000 for two (without alcohol), VAT & Service Charges extra."
"We had 4 nights in a suite in the heritage wing over looking the pool and everything about the hotel ran perfectly. The hotel is in a great location so you can walk out through the ""security"" and be in amongst the hustle and bustle of Mumbai. Colaba and Marine Drive are within walking distance so if you want to get out and eat elsewhere its very easy. Breakfast is plentyful and served with aplomb, the pool is quiet, the ambience and general feel are top notch. Great reception staff willing to help organise our next move and excellent housekeeping team who were flexible to our timings.  A special thanks to all the staff for a great stay and if we ever return to Mumbai we wont try anywhere else than the TAJ!"
"We stayed at this hotel both at the start and conclusion of our 20 day tour of India.It is an amazing hotel with a breakfast buffet to dream about. The service was impeccable and friendly and its well worth the time to take the Heritage tour at 5 pm each day. The guide brings the hotel alive and explains the history including the terrorist attacks in 2010. The Palace part of the hotel is the old and more splendid building with the towers built in the 70's still meeting the 5 star standard.Try the Indigo restaurant behind the hotel it does awsome ""Buffalo"" tenderloin which is a welcome break after all that curry and spice!"
"situated by the sea, by the India Gate, by the wall, a long long sea wall that encompasses daily life in the Bollywood capital, the Taj embodies everything you want in India. Quintessentially Indian, it is living history that has played an integral part in the development of Mumbai. Yet at the same time it is uxurious and modern. The luscious textiles used in the soft furnishings tell of the country,s richness, drapes, cushions, carpets, are all handloomed and loomed silks of rich colurs and designs. The public areas are filled with guests and the high livers of Mumbai socety. All facilities are of course there. Eateries are all marvellous. The heritage wing is the one to go for. You can sleep in beds that have been occupied by celebrities, presidents and kings and enjoy a"
Me and my wife spent a weekend here. We were upgraded to the heritage wing club rooms. The best hotel experience I had in the country. Truly world class!! Luxurious! Best club facilities. We had an excellent time. Every detail was looked after. This is the second time I'm here. Last it was business and this time leisure. Both were excellent experience. Tea at the pool side was wonderful. Love to come back again
I was a great treat to lunch here. Good food to eat. Spa facilities were excellent. Rooms were very clean. It is one of the great 5 star hotel to visit. Location is just fantastic. Service is good. Overall rating is excellent. This is the nice place to visit if you have money.

"If you want to know Bombay, and it's history... Taj Mahal Palace is a must.  The service is outstanding and was the perfect way to end our two weeks in India!  "
"What else would you expect from this brand of hotels - their Indian-ness boldly intertwined between luxury and royalty. It has a regular fan base who are the real supporters of the Taj heritage. Personally I think their legacy is worthy of its recognition and the service is excellent. The food could be a bit better though. Overall, a nice stay!"
"Stayed for work at this beautiful hotel which is one of the oldest and best hotel in the country. Over looking the sea this is the property which is truly world class and luxurious. This place had seen the terrorist attack though no expense is spared to bring it to its old glory, the plaque mentioning the name of staff which lay there life is emotional to look at. Suggest to eat at Masala Craft and afternoon tea overlooking the swimming pool. The hotel itself is a palce to visit when in the city, if you are staying in it, its a bonus. Do visit the place even if you are staying anywhere else.  Good luck and keep it up Team Mahal, Bombay. Sunit"
"I spent 13 nights in the Palace Wing (4th floor) city view. The room and the hotel were as good as I expected. But what really set this hotel apart from every other hotel I have ever stayed in was its exceptional service. Each and every member of staff I interacted with during my stay (without exception) treated me like royalty. It really is a palace. The staff are very professional and they all seem to be proud of ""their"" hotel and this is what makes the difference. I would recommend this hotel to any one. Especially the senior management of other five star hotels around the world so that they can know what hospitality is all about."
"Stayed in a luxury grande palace room in the heritage / palace wing.  The refurbishment post the 2008 attacks is superb and this majestic property is even more elegant and luxurious than ever.  Room was large, beautifully furnished and incredibly comfortable.  My request for down pillows and duvet had been met. The bathroom was huge and finished in beautiful white marble.  Shower was incredibly powerful.  For such a luxury hotel the service is remarkable relaxed and un-stuffy.  Breakfast in the Sea Lounge was wonderful, as was tea and biscuits in the Palace Lounge.  My only quibbles, which made the stay less than perfect, were (1)  the free HSIA advertised in my package on-line was only honoured after several phone calls and arguments with receptionist / duty manager; and (2)"
This was an excellant hotel and had the best staff which made our stay a memorable one. From the time you enter you are welcomed and greeted by courteous staff who make you feel really special. Every little detail was upto our expectations and would certainly recommend it.
"My wife and I spent three nights at the Taj Mahal Palace at the end of February this year. We had booked an executive suite but were upgraded to a Grand Luxury Suite, ' Primrose Suite '. We had access to all areas of the hotel. Daily high tea, evening cocktails and after dinner cognac and chocolates were all included.   The suite itself was spacious and included a reception area for guests including a separate bathroom, dining room, and study. The bedroom was huge as was the bathroom, which included two separate entrances, a large bathtub and shower. There was an enclosed balcony which looked out on the Gateway of India, as did all the windows. A more impressive location and setting is hard to imagine. We had the services of a personal butler.  The reception and elegant"
The hotel is spectacular as an historic building and the pool area is nice but the rooms are very small and very dated. Its location is great but it also means you hit swarms of people everytime you leave the hotel.
"I have waited years (almost 5) before I finally write this review. The reason being that I just did not believe what happened to us, but talking to others with similar experience confirmed that I was quite correct and hence I finally put 'pen to paper'! Me and my wife are big fans of the Taj group. I have stayed at almost ten different Taj managed hotels around the world and still keep going back. I had always heard the reason Tata made this first Taj hotel (when he was thrown out of a hotel during the British Raj, he vowed to make a much grander one right next to that one), so it made us really sad when we were treated as second class citizens in the very same hotel in our own country! It was a shocker...... We still return to Taj hotels....... but never to this original one!"
The palace is a very interesting hotel because half of it is the original palace and the other half is the new tower.  We were upgraded into the original palace which was lovely and elegant. Our room overlooked the water which made the room. The room itself was pretty but on the small side. The halls in the old palace side are not air conditioned so it gets a bit hot.   The pool area is gorgeous and really feels like an oasis in the crazy city.  Unfortunately I was a little sick in Mumbai so I didn't get to try the food ( other than rice and bananas!) but the main dining room was lovely.  We didn't try the other restaurants although there were many of them and they looked great.   The service was very good and attentive.
"Steeped with history, this hotel is iconic and beautiful. We stayed here for a few nights and were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived. Good choice of cuisine from the various resturants and the high tea in the sea lounge was a real treat being up from Chennai. Although we didn't use the pool it looked inviting and it was very relaxing just to sit around with a cold drink and a copy of Viz. The hotel offers a tour of the Taj Palace every day at 5pm, it is very interesting and complimentary.The hotel is immaculate throughout and the staff are extremely courteous and professional, we even had a butler but opted not to trouble her. The standard in both the Palace wing and the Tower are first class and although we stayed in the Palace wing, I'd have been just as happy in"
"We typically associate places as opulent as the Taj, with beautiful buildings and world class facilities. More often than not the soft skills (service) falls short of expectations. Taj Mahal palace offers you the best of both worlds. Much has been said about the luxury and impeccable style of the hotel. It is of course a must visit heritage site in Mumbai as much as it is a hotel. Built right on the sea shore in Colaba, it offers stunning views of the Mumbai shoreline.  The standards of service are also amazing. Right from the front desk staff to the concierge who helped us with our luggage, their attitude and professionalism was very evident. All in all a great stay and a symbol of pride for every Indian, considering the circumstances under which the hotel was built and the"
"A majestic hotel with beautiful views, exquisite architecture and excellent service.  Just stepping into the hotel each time makes you feel special.  My most favourite restaurant in the whole world is here, the Zodiac Grill; nowhere else would i go for a special celebration!"
"The elegance and the luxury of the Taj, especially the gorgeous Palace Wing is undeniable. Breakfasting by the pool, surrounded by greenery in the heart of one of the world's busiest cities is a privilege indeed. I can't fault the Taj for architecture, facilities, room standards, cleanliness or any of the usual indicators of a good hotel... but I really didn't enjoy it.   The obsequious service style is over the top. I am quite capable of carrying my own glass of orange juice from buffet to table and so to have it confiscated from me by a white-gloved butler and carried ahead of me to my place felt just plain silly. Ditto not being allowed to spread a towel on a lounger for myself or open the door of my own room. After 24 hours of this, I asked for an iron and ironing board and"
"The Taj is an iconic classic hotel that is a gem.  Set on the waterfront by the Gateway to India monument to the Raj it has a wide variety of rooms and accomodations.  Get a view of the Arabian Sea.  The pool is a marvelous place to rest after a busy day in the city.  The restaurant choices are excellent.  This hotel is a proud symbol of today's India, resourceful and vibrant, looking to a bright future."
we had a great room facing the gateway of india breakfast at the hotel is wonderful had dinner at the chinese restaraunt and at the oriental restaraunts both were great the room is very nice and clean the staff is very freindly and helpful wonderfull swiming pool
"We had booked a twin room but were allocated a double.  The receptionist immediately said we could upgrade to a Hollywood suite at the rear of the hotel at no extra charge.  However, once we'd seen the double room and, more importantly the view from it, we decided to stay put.  We were directly opposite the India Gate and enjoyed the most wonderful view throughout our stay.  Although the restaurant service generally was faultless, we were disappointed with the breakfast service as, although it was self service, it took an age for someone to offer tea and coffee.  We waited so long that eventually we had to leave without being served as our guide was waiting to take us on a tour.  A real 'must' was the free guided tour of the hotel in the evening that was available to residents"
When in Mumbai do not Miss the Taj Palace hotel. The Structure as well as its location are something to see and remember. Great place to stay if you have the money. Great food at their restaurants. Fantastic view from the hotel out to the sea.
"Was a wonderfull hotel with great service. the 1st room they put us in was a touch too small , was facing the sea and had an extremely strong musty odour. we decided to upgrade to a suit and pay an additional amount. the suite was beautiful situated in the corner of the floor. at approximately 5pm until 8pm you could there was a strong odour of Kerosene. i did complain but it remained.  service in this hotel is excellent"
"From the minute we entered 'The Palace' we knew we were into something really special. The service from the pick-up at the airport to the meet & greet and into the check-in was par excellance. The Palace suites are superb and the service is as good as it gets anywhere on our planet. We were in the Taj Club and whilst at first thinking it expensive, with all the extras & inclusions, it is something everyone should enjoy on their bucket list. The staff go out of their way to please their guests and that.... they do so well. I would like to name them but as they are all so attentive it would be remiss of me to leave any of them out."
"this hotel is best in mumbai,great staff,ambiance ,superb management , excellent food ,right next to bargain market and lots of good resturant ,if you like to watch a movie , Inox Multiplex  theather is close by Taxi say around 10 mins which is also close to the business center i.e Narimen Point Area ,also the theather has an excellent food court ,"
"My wife and I were fortunate to stay here for three nights before heading back to England. It is probably one of the best hotels that we have stayed at throughout our travels around the world. The staff were excellant and they went out of their way to assist us. We had a room on the 19th floor overlooking the Arabian Sea and what a view that was, next time though we would like to stay in the Heritage part of the hotel which is majestic. The restaurants were superb and we certainly tried three of the restaurants and we were not dissapointed. They took extra time to ensure what we ordered waswhat we wanted and explained all to us....my mouth waters now just thinking about some of the great food we experienced. The overall ambience and history of the Hotel was a delight...we cannot"
"I was a little apprehensive when I was to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace, Apollo Bunder. For I wondered how a lowly local would be treated in this hallowed space mostly inhabited by corporate or diplomatic royalty. But there was a pleasant surprise in store.  I was given a traditional welcome at the reception and everything was in order - they preparations were in order and they were expecting me! I was efficiently ushered into my room after the check-in formalities. In the room there was an envelope / letter addressed to me with details of facilities available. Brilliant!  The food at the coffee shop and Shamiana restaurant was quite delectable. While the buffet wasn't some niche fine-dine cuisine, it offered a wide spread of items and each one was wholesome and fantastic. For"
"Booked Taj Towers for a weekend gateway from Pune. Wanted a drive down and relax. When i reached, we were greeted with the fact that we were upgraded to Taj Mahal (The hotel opened it's door to guests in 16 December 1903) the most lavish hotel in India. We were happily amazed and appreciated the age old experience one gets from TAJ HOTELS. Walking through the alley you could feel the luxury and the old architecture reminds you are at a monument. We were escorted by our floor manager and given one of the finest room overlooking the Gateway of India. You should see how perfect it way. As a kid, I always dream of living in this hotel one day. The manager was benevolent and showed us around the room which had green walls, white bed sheets, a small coffee table with 2 chairs"
"If you like to be seen and taken good care of, this is the place to be in. The hotel has risen literally from the ashes again after the 2008 terror attack, and wow! what a comeback. Just walking through the hotel is almost like visiting a mini museum, carrying a histroy of a century with it. the food is the best you can get in the city, the staff is caring polite and proud to be associated with the House of Tata and will be there to assist you  every step of the way without being obtrusive. my compliments to the Team for living up to its name!"
"Having just come from the Oberoi in Udaipur, we were expecting to be disappointed. We were not.   The lobby is phenomenal and the staff very attentive.   We arrived late and went straight to dinner at Masala Kraft. Was the best dinner we'd had in 10 days of delicious dinners in India.   Our waiter, Sundip, was exceptional. He was patient and explained everything. Noting our interest in the flavors of India he even brought us complimentary tastings of other regional specialties.   The manager, Gave, was likewise fantastic. He took the time to speak with us about the history of the Taj, the restaurants chef, and India in general. I have a true passion for cooking and the next morning awoke to a beautifully wrapped sachet of spices to take home to begin my Indian cooking"
It is definitely the most beautiful hotel in the city with an old world charm. Giving some of the best views money can buy. Lovely restaurants specially the rooftop Souk serves the best food in the Taj.  However the only negative being the cell phone network is terrible.
"We were fortunate enough to spend 2 weeks at this magnificent hotel. The staff were fantastic, especially with our 2 year old son who was treated like royalty. The hotel is spotless, the pool is lovely and the staff are superb!  Thank you for a wonderful stay"
"Excellent quality in everything they do. Our arrival at 4.00am in the morning feeling shattered was exemplary. They had all our check in details  ready for us, took us to a lounge area to register rather than the desk. Gave us  a flower garland welcome, blessing and red dot on the forehead. Staff were so helpful and polite all the way through our stay. Probably didn't do justice to the breakfast buffets, which were stunning, being somewhat too tentative and careful in what we ate. Rooms immaculate Security getting into the hotel is understandably rigorous in view of recent events and there is a noticeable security presence throughout the hotel. But it does not feel at all obtrusive and is typical of the style and taste in which they deliver service, Expensive by Indian, but not"
"very slick and professionalservice, from the met and greet at the airport to room service.."
warey wah kya experience yar one day king in this hotel at every inch we can experience the feeling of prince in this hotel   but small problem will be faced by indian at bath room plz keep some flusher yar and there is no complaint
"A quick update of my thoughts on the Taj Mahal Palace since last August's visit with some thoughts from this March's visit.   First, the Taj Mahal Palace is truly an iconic place with rich (and tragic) heritage.    The facility is amazing, I can't say anything more than that, it is perfect.  A thought on an improvement since my last visit, the breakfast lounge seemed to be more organized than previously and arranged for seating and serving more expeditiously.  Great job on that.  The reason that I dropped one rating point from this hotel and probably will not seek out Taj hotels in the future (and I hope this doesn't sound picky) is the way this hotel and the Taj chain handles it's frequent stayer program guests.    I am Gold on Taj.   On both this stay and my August stay, I was"
The hall of the hotel is beautiful and there is this jasmine wonderful smell about it... The rooms are fine but what is really worth the visit is their swimming pool surrounded by tropical plants and their nice terrace to eat or drink.
"I just love it.  The pool is amazing, the pool boys brilliant, staff are very friendly (once you have a joke with them and break the ice) and on return I got a lovely photo of us (which we had posed for) sent from one of the guest relations girls which was a lovely surprise.  Met a lovely young lady at our previous hotel in Sawai Madophur and replied to her when she asked 'where next?', ""my favourite hotel in the world, the Taj Mahal Hotel Mumbai"" and it turns out she is a director at the Taj Mumbai,  so I was happy I said that before she told me she works there or it may have sounded contrived.  We had a lovely room overlooking the Gateway of India and I must say the bed was really comfortable and the AC is silent, and I mean silent.  (Room 347) next to the Rajput Suite. "
"Wonderful location of this atmospheric and stylish hotel.  Overlooking the gateway to India and the busy harbour it is within a comfortable walking distance of many of the interesting sights. With Impeccable service, beautiful pool and a superb buffet breakfast  I feel the prices are fully justified..  However the to eat in the hotel or have a coffee appeared on the very expensive side."
"Check in was gracious.  The staff asked us to relax in a library style bar while they went through the formalities.  Drinks were served during the process.    My room was large and well equipped.  Bed was extremely comfortable, butler was very helpful.  Basically, it was as good as it gets!  We dined in the modern Indian restaurant and it was one of the best meals I've had in years.    Breakfast in the 1st floor ""room"" was average, with less attentive service than the rest of the hotel.    The gym was well equipped and accessible 24/7.  It has six life fitness or newer technogym treadmills, two technogym ellipticals, and a technogym bike.  These are the newest technogym equipment so they're OK.    The evening cocktails and afternoon tea were excellent.  Overall the staff were"
"Very well located close to Gateway of India, Prince of Wales museum etc. The hotel itself is truly an excellent 5-star hotel and the seaside view is wonderful. The pool is very large and deep, and is behind the hotel where it is rather quiet. You do not think you are in the middle of a megacity."
Its remarkable piece of arch.Its have buitiful view asspecially facing sea.In other words stone are singing.Its all side has speciality and most beautiful is main entrance which is on back but it is worh seeing.old and new both buldings are excellant.
You cannot fault this place in any way. Absolutely brilliant!
"After just staying in the midland hotel, horrific, this was a wonderful welcome.  They give you a Hindu greeting and lei also a weird drink upon check in. I was given room 1001 with a small step out balcony.  You are right in the midst of things. It still is quiet.  The room was perfect and especially liked the pool area which use to be the front of the hotel.  Water heated and view of the architecture a treat. These hotels all seem to give you form letters but no info in them.  After the nightmare at the midland and long travel not sure what was told to me and I missed two days of the fantastic  brunch which was included in my rate.   I  picked the taj because of its provenience and articles I read about it along with other guests mentioning their reason for staying.  Will not"
"Stayed here for 4 nights, the stay was wonderful. The service was impeccable! the pool was great as were the internal features of the Taj hotel.  would def recommend to all international visitors who come to Mumbai!"
Though we stay in Mumbai we went across to the Taj Mahal Palace for a short one night stay to chill out and relax. The stay exceeded our expectations and justified the top ranking that this hotel gets. The reservations were fast and efficient. But the expoerience started when we landed up at the hotel.. The check-in was replaced by a traditional welcome with a garland and tikka excpet that the lady doing it did not appear to be doing a chore or following a laid down process. It appeared like she was genuinely welcoming us. Thereafter she took us up to our room where she was nice enough to let us get over the awesome sea view with the bobbing sailboats and majestic ships including the INS Viraat not to forget the stately Gateway of India. 19 storeys above the street gave a new
The location is perfect.  It is walking distance to the main shopping market and also to the gateway of india and the boats.   Service is exceptional.  All employees ensure that you are satisfied and they are friendly and you receive your requests within minutes  The breakfast is not to be missed!
We stayed in the Palace and were amazed at this beautiful building especially the grand staircase and the FLOWERS!The floral arrangements and the aroma throughout the hotel were so beautiful.  Our room staff and restaurant staff were incredible and could not do enough for us.  The only disappointed for us was the staff at front of house in the Palace area.  They were not as welcoming as we had come to expect after staying at other Taj Hotels throughout India.
"The iconic hundred-and-six-year-old ""Taj Mahal Palace & Tower"", Mumbai is an architectural marvel. It has always aspired in bringing together, a flamboyant and fantastic architecture with Moorish, Oriental and Florentine styles. Within, it regales fusion of majestic Indian elegance with a refreshing European touch. Rooms overlook the city or pool, or face the Gateway of India and Arabian Sea. Several sophisticated dining venues satisfy the most jaded palates. The business center and six meeting rooms form an ideal venue for business tete-a-tetes.          I happened to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace once when in Mumbai.The hotel itself is beautiful and comfortable, but it is the staff who really deserve a mention. The level of service and hospitality is truly outstanding.        "
"Having stayed at the Four Seasons, Trident, Oberoi and Westin, I decided to stay at the Taj Palace hotel on a leisure trip.  Having booked a club room in the Palace wing, I was collected by a Jaguar at the airport.  From check in to check out, it was simply a perfect stay, Taj simply does it very well in their top hotels.  The Palace wing is the place to stay, and I would suggest a sea-facing room, it is a few Rupees more but worth it.  The pool is great, as is the spa (although rather small).  Had dinner at the Lebanese restaurant on the 19th floor, great food and view.  Staying at the Taj puts one in the heart of old Bombay, one can walk to all the major sites in Colaba within 30 minutes, and Chor Bazaar  and Pheonix Mall is a short taxi ride away.  Excellent concierge and"
"After the 24 hour journey from Canada, arriving at the Taj Palace was delightful. Even better, after a day of exploring Mumbai, having this hotel as a sanctuary was a breath of fresh air. The pool is stunning, the food is great, and the lobby smells like a fancy spa. We loved it! "
"This is the place to stay in Mumbai! If you're on a shoestring budget I appreciate that this may be out of range but for pretty much everyone else, the difference between other hotels and this one is phenomenal! The price difference (negligable) begins to evaporate in your mind as soon as you step through the doors into the lobby...ambience galore. Amazing staff: attentive (the service manager called me up to ask if I needed a late check-out), present in an unobtrusive way! The location is unbeatable, just steps away from the Gateway to India and the Colaba Causeway and the the hotel itself oozes understated luxury. Shoutout to Viren, the Experience Manager, who gave the most interactive, entertaining and informative tour of the Heritage Wing followed by drinks (complimentary)"
"The Taj Palace & Tower Hotel in Colaba (South Mumbai) deserves its reputation: this is a stunning example of early-20th elegance with truly stunning dining rooms, the famous corticoed staircase, with beautiful and quiet (yup, quiet!) pool area. The service is excellent, location ideal, and the food is outstanding.  That said, here is some advice to make the most of the Taj while preventing a shock at checkout. First, shop around the web for a good room rate. Stay in the Tower: the rooms are not as posh as in the Palace, yet they are a fraction of the price and we get to enjoy all the same amenities of this stunning building.   Second, enjoy the huge buffet breakfast (ensure you visit the beautiful green coffee-shop in the Palace for one of these) but try hard to avoid taking any"
"The hotel itself is beautiful and very comfortable, but it is the staff who really deserve a mention. The levels of service and hospitality are truly outstanding, nothing is too much trouble but they manage this without overwhelming their guests."
As the car pulled into the secure entrance a lady greeted me and whisked me past the majestic lobby to my room whe the check in process was speedy and efficient. The staff are ALL diligent and keen I help in any way possible.  They don't know the word NO....everything is possible and they are courteous and helpful. I stayed on two occasions over a few days and the experiences were flawless.
We stayed in the old heritage wing which was a fabulous experience and the bathroom was great too. However the noise from below on the road was quite disturbing even though the windows were all shut.  The room service is quite steeply priced and it seemed better to go to the restaurant and eat. Other than that we had a great experience at the hotel
"I was at this hotel for 3 nights. Fabulous room, great service. People work in this hotel are EXCELLENT. Always with great beautiful smile. Specatacular service.  It is so weird to walk out of this spotless hotel and see the dirt and disgusting smell from the water. Again, it is India. India is a beauiful country with bad hygiene.  I was quiet disgusted by the smell coming from the water - you can not aviod. you can not runaway from it. It is in your face.  Just out side of this fabulous hotel - you see people - adults and childrens are sleeping on news papers. At the same time, local extreme RICH mumbai people are celebrating wedding inside with thousands of people.  Again, it is INCREDIBLE INDIA.  Would I stay here again? Absolutely YES. Would I be happy walk outside the"
"As a business traveler I have stayed in around 100+ hotels in Mumbai including five star, four stars and three stars hotel. I visit Mumbai five times in each month. Last one I have long business meeting with one of potential client and we had stayed in The Taj Mahal Place hotel. Though I have stayed in other Mumbai hotels but the experience I got from The Taj Mahal Place hotel was totally different. According this hotel is best for business meeting. The hotel had arranged a special business meeting room for us. In business meeting room had decorated with modern technology like projector, microphone, wireless internet and many more.  Another Point I want add in this list that is food menus. Menus like Kanha Kebab Delight- Chicken Tikka filled in Garlic Bread were too testy."
"As a frequent world traveller, this has to be my favourite hotel in the world. Yes, it is an iconic building (take the hotel tour with Viren at 5pm daily) and it is 5 (7?) star quality but what really makes this my second home is the staff. They are simply the kindest and professional ever.   Any visitor to Mumbai must at least visit this hotel. If you are staying, go for the Palace wing. I dont approve of people who visit a new place and never leave the hotel but I will make an exception in this case. You can spend a few days in this hotel and never be bored, chillax by the pool, do a pub crawl (start with sunset drinks by poolside 'Aquarius' then Harbour Bar then Starboard). Decide if you want Chinese ('Golden Dragon') or Indian ('Masala Craft') etc.   It is also a safe haven"
I stayed here with my family on 3rd-4th march 2012.  It was an amazing experience.  the building itself is fantastic and steeped with history.  The Staff are excellently trained and very friendly.  the restaurant food and room service are top notch.  If you are in india staying here is a must!
"Service is amazing, pool is wonderful and makes the whole experience one that must be had! Hotel is affordable in fact comparably well priced, food is a little pricey but may be worth it to save your tummy from sickness.. The wine will require an additional mortgage to afford ( as with all hotels in India) but you must try the Sula Shiraz ( Indian wine and cheapest of bunch but very good !)  Try and see an IPL cricket match while there.. Concierge will sort for you and lots of fun!"
charismatic interiors. the class of the Tata's can never find a better place than this. Excellent cusine.. can't beat that.. exotic service The hotel staff is so well groomed and well behaved i could ever find. Always people used to tell me that Taj is a jannat and now i believe that.. Really fantastic experience.
Excellent service and food. This place is where the class in hospitality shines. I will not miss staying here or any other Taj property whenever possible
"After a relaxing week in Goa, I stayed here for two nights, one night more than I had planned...and SO GLAD I did...one night is not enough at this wonderful hotel. I could stay for a month! From check in at The Palace side with fabulous flowers and staff, to the escort to the room, this is a Grande Dame in the hotel world.  I was offered the Heritage Tour on arrival, and this was a great way to see the hotel and understand the history attached to it and the rest of the Taj group. Rooms are luxurious with all one could want. The restaurants and shops wonderful- no need to leave the hotel. I just loved it and intend going back to see more of these wonderful hotels. Attentive staff, a great pool offer, this is pure heaven! Treat yourself!"
The hotel is great and Its walking distance from very nice restaurants and shopping areas. 
"Great hotel one of the best - clean, great service they clean rooms twice a Day I purchased some items they helped pack them. Awesome food & breakfast buffet, nice shops inside. I loved it."
"I was met by a proud, exceptionally courteous staff who instantly gave me a sense of 'specialness' that, I have to say, I have never felt at any property anywhere before. A short welcoming ceremony added to my feeling that I was on the cusp of a unique experience. Everything about this property is unique. I was escorted to my room through a beautifully restored property with distinctive architecture and decorative appointments. The rooms in the main building are luxurious, over the top, and well appointed. Room service arrived in 10 minutes on 2 occasions. A surprise thoughtful gift was given to me at departure to conclude my stay. Great neighborhood.  A property you wish you could check into, and never leave. Highly recommended!  If on business, make sure you select a hotel"
I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in March 2012 with my family.  we were ungraded to a room with a view of the Gateway of India which was great..staff was very helpful had a smile on there faces . Best swimming pool i have ever seen and mouthwatering dishes  Thanku for making our stay a wonderful stay.. highly recommended.
"Everything is taken care of here - it really is a privilege to stay at this hotel.  I enjoyed the afternoon tea, cocktail hour and a couple of the restaurants in the hotel - all excellent. The breakfast was taken looking out on to the Gate of India, very relaxing and enjoyable. To get the best service you must speak to the staff - they will give you lots of advice and information. For example, I was chatting to one of the staff about where I was traveling to next after mumbai and what I was hoping to see. The next day, I found  a large printout of tourist info, specific building information and other useful bits and bobs in my room. I was very impressed that the 'small talk' was converted into action. I've never had that kind of service in a hotel before. I hope to return soon."
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in March 2012 with my husband. The hotel lived up to its reputation and more. We stayed on the 5th floor of the palace wing of the hotel with a view of the Gateway to India - I think it was worth the upgrade to stay in the palace. The food here was also excellent, especially the daily breakfast and high tea in the Seaview lounge. We also ate at Masala Craft one evening and got the chef's selection menu - definitely the priciest meal we had in India but it seemed fitting given the opulent environment. The staff were great and very helpful - I wanted to have a sari that I purchased turned into a ready made and they arranged for this to be done in two days."
"My partner and I stayed for 3 nights, as our only 'luxury' stay in our holiday around India. Upon check in we were ungraded to a room with a view of the Gateway of India which was great. Service was fantastic. Staff were always helpful and attentive. Even sheets were changed daily. The bed had about 10 different types of pillows, and a menu describing each pillow, which was hilarious. Restaurants were slightly pretentious and ridiculously over priced, and the food was just okay. We found better restaurants a block or two walking distance via Lonely Planet guide. Although the hotel contained much history and elegance, it felt fake. Just outside the front door, the poverty and stench is overwhelming. It is by no means real Mumbai until you step outside. But if you're going for the"
"We LOVED this hotel right in the heart of Mumbai. We stayed in the heritage/palace wing (historic section) which I highly recommend. I loved the grand staircase so much that I never took the elevator -- it was too pretty to pass up the experience on the staircase. Breakfast was included for us, and it was amazing. We ate the first morning in the Sea Lounge - which (as expected) has a view of the sea. The next morning we ate by the pool, and I have to say I liked that even better (more selection in the buffet and I like sitting outside for meals if the weather is nice). The hotel is a landmark in Mumbai/Bombay - so we felt like we were experiencing history even while relaxing in the room or by the pool. The guided tour of the hotel is well worth your time - our guide was animated"
"My friends and I went there for Lunch and some drinks, whilst staying nearby in the Oberoi (a much nicer, friendlier hotel that is definitely worth a visit).  At the Taj, when my food arrived, I took one bite and found hair in the food.  The staff took it away, and I requested that I order something else instead of being given a replacement of the same item from the menu.  The manager (European I think) came over to notify me that he would take the item off my bill.  There was no apology, and I even had to pay for the replacement.  I would have expected a little more from one of the finest hotels in India (apparently).  It seemed as though they only wanted to the absolute minimum they had to, which is exceptionally poor!  Most hotels and restuarants would not only remove the"
"Having travelled on business for more than 25 years, this hotel stands out as one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. An architectural pearl in the centre of Mumbai. The service was attentive and the staff were pleasant and willing to go the extra mile at all times. Rooms including bathrooms were spacy and comfortable and beautifully designed. Meals at the hotel were excellent especially breakfast which is served at several locations at the hotel. This was true value for money. I'll bring my wife next time!"
"Fell in love with Mumbai and this hotel on arrival. Loved the view of the gateway, the Seaview tearoom and the poolside area. Excellent breakfasts. Everything is walkable from this hotel, a great launching pad to see the historic south mumbai area."
"Me and my wife stayed at Taj palace Mumbai for our 10th wedding aniverssary, we were treated like a royalty, we stayed at Heritage Wing, which is much nicer than Tower Wing, big rooms, nice views, good place to explore the city. Breakfest at Sea Lounge was a experience not to forget, stuff at the lounge perfect, great food and music, and great view of the Arabian Sea...Concierge and travel desk were very helpuful and friendly!"
"We stayed at the Taj for just 2nights en route to Kerala and found Bombay an exciting and vibrant city and we wished we had stayed longer.The hotel is such an icon and feels like the only place to stay! On most afternoons,there is a guided tour around the hotel for guests which is well worth joining,and it is free.The service,food,cleanliness and overall quality of the hotel cannot be faulted."
"DO NOT STAY IN THE TOWER!!!  If you stay in the palace you will have the greatest experience ever.  Service is not overbearing but they fulfill every wish you could have.  Excellent, excellent breakfast in the sea room.  The pool area is AMAZING as well.  I can't say enough about the experience."
Great atmosphere and great restaurants.  The food at Zodiac Grill and Wasabi is simply outstanding.  I have been visiting this property for the last forty-five years.
excellent service from staff and management >>too business orientated.Security .prob the guy with the black suit if i remember was rude and arrogant ...prob because i was south african with south indian origin..
We got an excellent welcome by the staff and reception >Unfort the hotel has to much of a business feel and business men arriving all the the time >not recommed for a family holiday .Management @ the restauraunts were excellent> OnE FINE MORNING around 6 am i was taking pics of the hotel and the gateway>upon entering the hotel the so call securing was so arrogant and rude >i really think he would not have behaved so if you i was a non indian >cannot enjoy the luxiuries of the hotel due to business orientation
"We love India and have been visiting magnificent  Taj Palace Hotel regularly since the mid 1970’s. The lobby area has always been an absolute haven of peace and tranquillity away from the Mumbai noise and complete chaos outside. The quality of hospitality and service from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave is quite simply spectacular and every single member of staff is ever so helpful and polite.  There are few better in this respect.  If any??   We live in a very quiet rural location and Mumbai is the complete opposite, a big noisy city and the sound proofing in some of the rooms in the Tower Wing leaves a lot to be desired and due to its inadequacy you are constantly reminded that you are in a big noisy city. We stayed on the 7th floor in a City View room and at"
"Fantastic stay, pure luxury. Staff treated us like royalty. Stayed in the Tower with a room overlooking the gateway to India, magnificent."
The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is reason enough to visit Mumbai. However entering the palatial portals of this icon of luxury and spendour does not have prepare you for the exquisite high tea you can enjoy upstairs. Remeber to ask for the dainties prepared for you by your waiter while you sip your tip. They are separate from the buffet. I could dine on this high tea for the rest of my life. If you have money to spare don't miss the jewelry shop downstairs. The diamond cut is different but exotic and wonderful and the most marvelous memento of your trip to India.
"If this is first time to Mumbai for business or any other reason, you must stay at the Taj Hotel. I have stayed at the taj 15-20 times. Request one of the newly renovated rooms in the heratige wing which is the orig part of hotel before the towers were added in in 1970's. This hotel is what other five star hotels strive to be. It is not fancy but rather a luxury that feels comfortable. You can imagine how life must have been in India for the upper class pre-1950's. Once behind the walls of the taj, it feels like a world away from the large city that is just outside. The breakfast buffet is the best I have ever had anywhere in the world. "
"We decided to splurge and stay at the Taj Palace due to its iconic status for its history and service.  It was the inconsistent service which we found slightly disappointing.  Our arrival started off well with a complimentary upgrade to the Palace wing but then went downhill when the put us in the empty lounge for 25 mins without any information.  An offer of tea came only after someone came in to check on us after 15 mins but the tea did not arrive (later brought to our room).  Nor did they give us any information on the hotels services when we checked in (ie. lounge use, breakfast locations options)  Among other issues was when given the name and neighbourhood of another Mumbai hotel, the concierge was unable to locate on the Internet (subsequent Self search easily found).  "
"Where to start? We had the pleasure of staying in the old part of The Taj Mahal Palace, at 4th floor, and the staff from the moment we arrived to after we checked out were more than amazing. There were a slight mix-up with the rooms, but it was taken care of, without any problems and the entire stay was filled with smiling staff, which were helpful and always ready to take care of any needs we might have.  The palace-tour was fantastic and I can recommend the High Tea at the lounges and the Chinese restaurant as well. There is nothing else to say, this hotel is awesome, fantastic, wonderful and I am lucky enough to have stayed there :)"
I recently stayed in this property with my collegue for a meeting & found this is one of the best Hotel of india i stayed in.good interior nice food. Overall good experience.
Impressive & fantastic service.  Out of this world hospitality that will leave you in awe & bliss.....From the Concierge desk to the Check-in counter to House-Keeping nothing was amiss..we were celebrating our 35thAnniversary & we were pamapered.  Special mention will also go to the Director of Sales who helped me with registration & all the last minute details Ms. Shaheen Rajguru.....She was great!     Keep up the great legacy. Shy from Canada
"Our flight came into Mumbai quite early in the morning.  We were met by someone from the hotel and escorted to a pre-booked car.  A friendly and informative driver kept us fully abreast with information about the areas and sights we passed through on the way into the hotel.  It immediately became apparent that arranging to be met at the airport is a good idea for anyone unfamiliar with the organised chaos that is urban India. Despite our arrival some hours before check-in time we were graciously received in the small separate reception hall reserved for guests staying in the Palace section of the hotel and, after a welcoming pot of tea and plate of biscuits in the elegant wood panelled and richly decorated Palace Club room (which is available complimentary to guests in the "
"i have stayed at some superb hotels in my travels,but the Taj  must be the best-compared to others this hotel is better than home!-any needs ,any hr,and you got them-please stay there and enjoy a sublime place of beauty-especially when you see elegance wrapped in a sari - value of around $250,000-you see the best at the TAJ.-SUPERLATIVE.-ROY-AUSTRALIA"
"The Taj Palace is impressive - impressive architecture, impressive pedigree, impressive location, impressive energy. For all these reasons we had expected more than the experience delivered. The hotel is large and teeming with guests and tourists alike. Service is good, but impersonal. We ate breakfast in a large room overlooking the Gateway of India, which also felt cold and impersonal. We dined at the Japanese restaurant in the hotel and were very disappointed - the quality of the food and the amount on the bill were miles apart. I enjoyed meandering down the hallway, looking at pictures of previous guests, but this didn't make up for the fact that the stay overall didn't meet our (admittedly high) expectations."
Probably the best service of any hotel I have stayed at in the world. Excellent food and a staff ready to go the extra mile.
"A beautiful hotel -- as fresh and gorgeous as I remember from my stays there as a child.  The service at this hotel is impeccable. We stayed in the old Taj portion of the hotel. I could just gaze down the hallways and into the rooms all day. They are so spectacular. My children were quite taken with the TV in the bathroom mirror.  I felt pampered from start to finish of our two day stay. The poolside is gorgeous as always. As is the upstairs restaurant in the old Taj. The staff were gracious and remembered our favorite dishes and tea preferences from day to day.   I did miss the Shamiana and the lovely little indoor fountain beside it. I believe they were damaged in the attacks in 2008.  A real treat. If you can't stay, visit for tea and take a walk around the hotel. Plan on"
One of the most famous hotels in the world and you can tell the moment you enter the lobby.  The place is bustling with tourists from every corner of the world.  The heritage wing is beautiful and worth seeing.  The tower wing looks like a 70s business hotel.   The grounds are beautiful and the location can't be beat.  The service in the restaurants are poor and the business support services are terrible.  So if you are going for a night as a tourist go for it.  I would avoid for business and a longer stay.
"Truly a sence of old India, impeccably restored after the attack. Room are beautifully appointed but a bit small."
"We stayed at the Taj Palace for four nights at the end of a two month trip around South India and we were not disappointed. The hotel is a historic landmark and a cultural icon. We were upgraded on arrival to a deluxe room in the Tower Building which made us wonder what a regular room was like, as the deluxe room was very nice and well equipped, but nothing terribly special. Everyone says the rooms in the original building are even nicer, but of course they are more expensive. Check-in and check-out was very efficient, as was housekeeping. There is excellent Wifi throughout the building, but it's expensive. You can use the Business Center for 30 minutes every day for free, which if you are just checking e-mail is worth knowing. There's an excellent free tour of the hotel given"
"The Taj Palace is a welcome refuge from the hubbub of central Mumbai, and probably now the safest place in the city (security is tight following the shootings some years ago). You don't have to book into the more expensive and stylish older part of the hotel to enjoy the the pool, the verandah and the other splendid public spaces in the colonial wing. Don't miss the beautiful staircase. Service is perfect, efficient and friendly. Perhaps not the finest food in the city, but a great place to stay, handy for the museums, parks, Victoria Terminus, and the Gateway to India."
"The Taj is amazing.  It was fantastic from the moment we piled out of our tiny cab and into the cool, plush lobby.  It was my husbands birthday, so we had a full sized cake delivered to the room a while after arriving.  Our 2 yr old was with us and received jig-saws and teddybears and everybody always remembered his name which was lovely.  We had a lovely babysitter that evening so we could visit some of the bars and restaurants (though we couldn't go to all, too many choices, one better than the other).  We got room service the second night of steak and wine, and it was truly one of the best meals i have ever had.  We went to the poolside for breakfast and it was very raj era.  I couldn't help imagining what the first visitors must have felt after walking off the ship through"
"...but with character! Yes, it's old (well, my room was) and it's fairly noisy (my room faced the Gateway of India) and the security is tight (understandably) and the breakfast wasn't that marvellous... But the place has character - loads of it. Great swimming pool, pleasant and extremely helpful service, bed was nice and comfy, great location and just a lovely atmosphere. Really enjoyed my stay - would love to go back as a tourist."
"After a long trip through South India we decided to treat ourselves to some serious pampering and rinse the dust off. The moment we arrived (at night) we were launched into a dreamworld. Once through the SERIOUS security we were welcomed in the Taj Club room for checkin with fresh watermelon juice. We had a suite in the palace wing - elegant appointments -  all marble bathroom as big as the bedroom with his and her vanities - huge walk in shower as well as a large claw tub - plenty of closet space. Separate dining area and small sitting area. No detail was too small - even the complimentary shower cap has a small black hair band in it! It was my husband's birthday and they had a chocolate cake sent to the room with a note. Flowers, a nice fruit plate and a bottle of red wine"
"My wife and I were on a ten day trip thru India and the plan was to spend the last day in Mumbai. We picked the Taj because of its reputation but also as a sign of defiance following the nasty attack on the hotel a few years ago. It turned out to be the best hotel we stayed in and a great way to end our tour of India. Not only does the Taj offer you everything you would expect from a five star hotel, but it seemed like every mural paining, every sculpture, every piece of decoration had been uniquely selected with great taste. We stayed in the palace and were also impressed by the TV that was imbedded in the bathroom's mirror, a piece of high-tech we had never seen before."
"The hotel itself is beautiful and the service is very good. The reception did take a long time for our checkin which was a bit annoying, but overall, no complaints. The hotel has great restaurants and you don't feel like leaving the hotel. I didnt get the chance to use the pool but I did take a massage at the spa. The spa was terrible and the entire operation of the spa looked shady."
"I had been to the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai just a few weeks before the tragedy in 2009, but did not stay there. At the time, I thought it was a lovely hotel with a good view of the harbor.  My first stay at the hotel earlier this year provided a different perspective and admiration. Of course, I was aware of what the hotel went through in 2009, but the stay provided me with an understanding of its long, glorious history in the decades before that. It is a hotel with plenty of stories to tell, a hotel with a unique character. To me, that is worth a stay in itself.  The service is outstanding. It is prompt and attentive. The staff has a ready smile. I guess you would expect this from the flagship hotel of the Taj group.   The breakfast spread was good, though I am sure the"
"Me and husband went for a stay in Taj mahal Palace on account of my birthday. To my surprise the room was decorated with balloons and there was a big birthday balloon right in the centre of our bed saying happy birthday with my name on it...The service is impeccable, the staff is the best you can find anywhere in the world..THis is listed under leading hotels of the world and it truly deserves it...The food is the best and the spa was heavenly...They gave me a free birthday cake :) The hotel staff really makes you feel like royalty...If you are in MUmbai and you can afford the Taj..I must say you really dont have a choice"
"One of my teenagers were taken ill in India with the ""Delhi belly"" from eating at a restaurant that we weren't familiar with. Well, not only did the staff keep vigil on her, but the chef advised us on what she could eat to help her recover and keep her energy up. Then made the food and sent it up for her. The hotel (duty) manager kept abreast of her situation too.  That was above and beyond... The regular operational staff, from the front desk to room service, were all extremely helpful and friendly. We love this place and will go back as often as we can (if $$$$$$ allows). Our laundry would come back with sachets of lilac and roses for us to keep, I have them still, 20 months later and they still have a lingering fragrance. Duty manager and front desk always knew who we were by"
This was a weekend trip. Our room was quite basic but the view was spectacular facing the gateway of India. Reception was warm. Wen we returned drenched from the monsoon we were given complimentary tea. We had one of the best guacamole at the hotel bar. U don't gave to go any where for 2 days. Walking along the hotel for street food and some famous local cafeterias was all we did. Will definitely stay again
Visiting Mumbai is always a get together time for me.. Catching up with my friends for some nice time.. This time we decide to visit the best bar in the city.. HARBOUR BAR.. Coming from Birmingham UK.. I was dying to try some good cocktails and must tell you was not dissappointed at all..  The passion and pride all the staff members portray while working is outstanding... Specially Himanshu who has been great and recommending us the best selection of drinks and canapés.  All in all had a fab night to remember.  Keep it up guys!
"When I told one of the staff in the restaurant that the Taj was the best hotel in India, he told me he was disappointed because they aspire to be the best in the world. This says a lot about the kind of service you can expect at this historic place.  The location is great, South Mumbai right across from the India Gate. The accomodations are top notch. The abience in the pool are gardens is very soothing. These alone would be reasons to choose the Taj. That said, it is the people. If you are going to Mumbai, there really is no other choice!"
"Incredible hotel.  The rooms were beautiful - quite business like, but had nice touches like an exotic fruit plate.  The breakfast was literally the best meal I have ever had! It's unbelievable. Wonderful relaxing pool and garden. Given the price - this hotel SHOULD be everything you've every dreamed of - and it is. It's very overpriced for India (I have stayed somewhere decent for 1,200 ruppees in Mumbai - this is 22,000), but for a little bit of luxury, I can't fault it."
"We stayed there for 3 nights in January 2012 and found this to be a fantastic hotel. Staff were more than helpful, nothing was a problem, the food was world class, and its in an excellent location. Its the best hotel we have probably ever stayed in.(we have been lucky enough to stay in numerous other 5 star hotels around he world.) If i was ever in India again its he one hotel i would certainly go back to. Its a city hotel though, and there are aspects that might not suit everyone i.e. there is only 1 pool and the pool area is not large which would need to be considered in the heat of the summer. It is also expensive i.e. drinks food etc(but value for money in our opinion)."
"Th Taj Mahal Palace hotel is simply amazing.  We stayed in the palace wing - room was wonderfully decorated, very large with every comfort you could imagine. Service was the best we have experienced anywhere in the world, and the food was excellent at every restaurant we tried. The location is very convenient, right in the heart of lively Mumbai."
"I had a privelege of staying at Taj for a day and it makes you feel a part of TATA's history and India's too.  View is great, Staff friendly and they made my B'day a life time memory... ( i visited on my B'day ). Staff has senta  cake and champgne bottle to the room ( facing Araina sea and Gateway of India).  You should be there to experiene that."
"From check-in to check-out the Taj Mahal hotel staff make you feel special. The traditional welcome, the customizing of dishes in the restaurants on request, friendly smiles and an ever helpful attitude sets hospitality of this hotel apart from the others. The spa services were excellent and the food in the restaurants was a delight. Granted its a splurge but its well worth it."
"I need to say.. I travel the world for a living and stay in countless hotels, The Taj Mahal Palace is not a hotel, the staff here will make you feel like a King.  Its memories like this that you look back upon in years to come and even though its a little more expensive than your average 5 star, you will not regret it! I will now stay here every time I come to Mumbai - well worth that little extra  Go on, just like I did... give it a chance and tomorrow I guarantee you will recommend it to someone else! make your dreams come true"
My wife and I stayed here for approx 4 days in Feb 2012. We deliberately chose a high class hotel to help offset the 'challenge' which is Mumbai and wow what a fabulous hotel this is. We were lucky enough to stay in the old part of the hotel rather than the tower and definately felt like we were in a place steeped in history.  In balance the food was pretty ordinary in the hotel and the India restaurant was dissapointing and very expensive - the learning is to eat out.  My recommendation is to try this hotel - i am sure that you can getting more modern and perhaps larger accomodation but you will not get this sort of old fashioned quality experience in many other hotels in the World never mind Mumbai.
"check in - very friendly and welcoming . i was met at the front door and whisked up to my room in the palace wing  to complete all formalities . soon after a butler arrived to show me around the room and explain the services offered room - i was upgraded to a large suite . very tastefully furnished , and extremely comfortable . separate lounge area , dining area and hall - all with beautiful paintings/ornaments . large walk in closet and dressing room with ample space . huge bathroom with separate shower and large spa bath club lounge - a good selection of books and magazines , very good snacks /drinks . service in the club lounge was quite slow , and definitely not as friendly as the rest of the hotel in room dining/ breakfast/restaurants - all excellent , and very good value"
"I'd been in India for 4 weeks when I stayed at the Taj and was ready for a bit of luxury. I spent 3 nights there and it really is a haven in the middle of manic Mumbai. All feels very grand: service, food and surroundings are all excellent. Also worth visiting the spa - the deep tissue massage I had was excellent."
"A true colonial hotel. The place to escape to after a day in  a depressing Mumbai. Comfortable, brilliant service and accommodating staff. As usual,  we were first shown the worst room they had although the hotel was half empty, but the management were quick to upgrade us after a perfunctory complaint. This technique seems standard now for those who book the lowest price on Internet. Presumably this is taught at hotel school so that the best rooms are available on the off chance a walk in pays rack rate.   But, unless you are on business or you take pleasure in walking  a city that had it's last coat of paint when the British left, there is no reason to even be there.  Buses that were used in the Carry on Movies, pre modern taxis and road safety, potholes, uneven walk ways, live"
"My partner and I spent a lovely two hours pottering around the hotel waiting for our flight. We could not afford to stay here but after visiting the Gateway we thought we would pop in for afternoon tea. Having then seen the prices we settled for a few indian snacks in their cafe (which was still a posh cafe!) the dosa's were stunning, very creative as one might expect and with tea the total was under £30 but we felt full so good value in all. No one treated us any differently to hotel guest despite us looking a little hot and sweaty and not carrying £3,000 luggage. A top hotel in a great location."
"Luxurious hotel, pleasant staff and good service. I do not like the location, being a Colaba, as it is very busy and congested."
"great hotel, such a feeling of grandeur with stunning Victorian architecture. the restaurant we visited was amazing, the buffet for breakfast was outstanding, the bar (and the characters) superb fun.  we had a deluxe room in the new part of the hotel and it was nice but small for what we paid. great to look out over the gateway though  statistic - i first visited India travelling for 6 months in 1995 and the cost of the entire trip was the same as our bill at the the Taj for 3 nights - so i think it's fair to say it's expensive  oh and the pool is, for me, one of the greatest pools in the world, including Thailand/Caribbean paradise locations - something about the haven in the chaos and the architecture  finally - great service in the main."
"Our three nights in the Palace Wing were a treat. We were upgraded from the Tower Wing, which was a real bonus as the two wings are nearly run as two separate hotels - separate breakfast areas, separate lobbies, lounge for Palace guests only. Our room was luxe, with a marble bathroom and dressing area. However the the highlight was the corridor outside - beautiful, with a variety of contemporary art.  I am sure the hotel was full, but we rarely saw anyone else.  Breakfast in the Sea Lounge was good, with plenty of choice if slightly patchy service.  And a view over the Gateway to India. For us there were two highlights to the stay - the free tour of the hotel with a highly enthusiastic ( if slightly know-it-all ) guide and afternoon tea in Palace Lounge.  All in all an"
"When my taxi pulled up to the Taj Mahal Palace I thought I was in a movie. This is such an iconic property and it met every expectation, especially its stunning historic wing. As to be expected from such a distinguished property, the level of service and every detail of the hotel was of very high quality. This is a very grand and impressive hotel and the care and detail of staff was impressive and appreciated. I arrived in the middle of the night on a delayed flight from Dubai and I was welcomed very warmly upon arrival and shown to my rather stunning room in the more modern tower wing. This is a luxurious hotel of the highest order, so expect every amenity and service to be first class. There seems to be a great deal of pride associated with this hotel, and I felt special just"
"I will admit that we did not stay at the Taj as we only had one night in Mumbai & had pre booked another hotel which was more the pity. However, we did enter the hotel and right from the start - the doorman, receptionists were friendly, helpful and welcoming. They made us feel at home, despite the fact that we were not house guests. We explained that we really wanted to dine in the hotel and we were led to the dining area of our choice. We were attended to immediately and were obviously made to feel valued. We took our time, enjoyed the fine food and the service , sat back and enjoyed the ambience. Later, we used the amenities and were invited to tour the hotel. We took many photos which will refreh my memory in the years to come - of a magical experience. I loved it!"
"Service was prompt but the rooms in the new wing were cramped for space. Being Taj they were prompt and treated us with great respect. The place is really neat and the ambience is really nice and quite , inspite of it being in the heart of Mumbai.The location is great. Breakfast is,as with all Taj hotels I think, fantastic."
"I waited 3 years to get the chance to stay here. When in Mumbai I often went to the Taj for lunch and always looked longingly at the pool area and wanted to be allowed out there one day. The only problem was that when I finally did get there (at about 1100 hours) I had to wait 45 mins to get a pool lounge. Make sure you get there early. I also could not book a Palace room due to a conference taking all available rooms, so I was somewhat disappointed with my 11th Floor Tower Room. The view over the Gateway of India and the concert in front of it was superb. The King size bed after a week in a Goa beach hut was sublime. The room was however small in comparison to The Intercontinental Marine Drive and the Taj lands End the bathroom was smaller than some 3 star hotels I have stayed"
"I didnt stay at the hotel , but chilled out at the starboard which served the most amazing long island ice tea I have ever had.i would highly recommend this place as well as the drink.the place is really neat and the ambience is really nice and quite , inspite of it being in Mumbai. It definitely is a quite hideout place out of the rush bush of the big crowded city.i simply loved this place"
"I had a beautifully decorated room with an incredible view north of the whole city. It was the first 5 star hotel I stayed at in India with Indian art on the walls. The hotel is charming and the service and general facilities were outstanding. The hotel is within walking distance of many interesting sites, shops and restaurants. Highly recommended experience!"
"First class hotel in an amazing location,with superb staff.Only had breakfast but the selection was the best we had in 3 weeks,and when we had an early check out(6.15am) the dining room staff couldnt do enough to ensure we had what we wanted although they do not open until 7am.Will definately stay here again.Thankyou thankyou everyone at the TAJ MUMBAI."
Had a great view of the Gateway to India from our room. The room was big and spacious. The level of service was outstanding. Wonderful Spa and swimming pool. An experience i will never forget.
What can I say about this hotel beacuse its wonder 7 star hotel best best every if you want to visit in Mumbai Stay in this hotel they provide all things which is useful to you you can take direct taxi for this hotel. and here are the large number of securities so they help you.
The hotel has all the charms of heritage and history of world celebreties visiting and staying.. still has a deep swimming pool.. the old and elegant service staff.. check in was superb.. and so the personal guest relation manager.. excellent variety of restaurant and at a reasonalble price.. the best part was to have a HIGH TEA at 1600 hrs in one of the restaurants.. with a view to harbour.. i never knew .. mumbai has so many yatchs.. it was like i was sitting in Greece or France.. too good..an experience.. my daughter enjoyed every moment..
"The Taj Mahal Palace totally lived up to our expectations. Incredible interiors and beautifully grand staircase. Try to stay in the Palace if you can, well worth the additional cost. The Tower looks completely out of place to the rest of the hotel stuck on the end.  Get to the pool in the morning and a sun bed should be easy to come by. Choose the right hand side as this starts off in shade but keeps the sun through the afternoon. The pool staff are really helpful as are the staff at the spa..  The only thing that lets the hotel down is the service by the pool in the late afternoon and early evening for food and drinks and the afternoon tea that we booked was a bit of a shambles. The food is excellent but it could do with a bit of more organising.  We had dinner at Masala Kraft"
We have stayed here several times in the past and this time they surpassed themselves! We stayed in palace wing which I just love and whilst there it was my birthday (which they had picked up when they look at your passport) and had decorated the room with balloons when we returned from dinner- followed on the actual morning by a wonderful looking cake! As we were flying off I asked that the cake be given to the staff who are excellent. Lovely lounge in Palace wing with beautiful books to browse along with daily papers etc. Service was very good check in very efficient as was the checkout. One of my favourite hotels in the world. Location is great for exploring the area as well.
From flawless check in by Viren our stay at the Taj was excellent. Beautiful room in the Palace overlooking India gate.  Food and service faultless.  A truly professional organisation and a wonderful experience.  Do take the Palace tour which runs each day at 5pm hopefully you will meet Viren who was pure theatre.
"This is the first “iconic” hotel (think Peninsular in Hong Kong, Oriental in Bangkok, Ritz in Paris etc.) that my wife and I have ever stayed at as we usually view such hotels as being too expensive but as it was my first time in India and we were arriving at two in the morning and had planned a four week trip of Southern India, we decided to indulge on this occasion.  A great decision!   Right from start despite the ungodly time, we were treated like royalty.  After being shown our room in the heritage, palace wing, a procession of service staff arrived one after the other serving us complimentary drinks, chai, snacks ... We thought we would have to put the ‘do not disturb’ sign out to get some sleep but right after the maximum spoiling, there were no more calls and we took in"
"We stayed in the Tower Wing of the Taj for part ( we had to leave at 1 30am) of our last night in India. Our  room faced the Gate of India and was spacious ( nor butler button in evidence like the Oberoi!) altough the bathroom was  surprisingly small , We regretted that we had so little time to spend here as the view was quite stunning.  The service and food in the retaurant were very disappointing. The service was extremely slow and it took a long time for each of us to be served the result being that the food was cold when it arrived. It was the most expensive food we ate in India and was certainly some of the poorest. We would not have eaten there again had we been staying longer.  The hotel had the feel of a big business consortium where individuals were not particularly"
"Recently was in Mumbai and went to Taj Mahal Palace, beautiful hotel..but cannot say the same for the service and food..it was dismal. We went to the Sea Lounge for High Tea. Was sorely disppointed. The quality of food was BAAAD. They had a crepe station...had to ask the chef THREE times before we got the crepes. The cutlery was tarnished silver. The staff had no idea regarding clearing plates etc. Gosh..I think for the flagship hotel of this chain the food and service would be top notch. Anyone planning to go for a visit or meal...think again.."
wow its great surprise to see the buety of hotel taj. i just say one thing in one word its amazing its bueatiful with good service.the atmosphere and the food quality was also out standing during my vacation.
Situated opposite the gateway to India national monument this hotel is part of the history of the city of Mumbai.  The standard of service is excellent. Nothing is too much bother for the staff.  The pol area is small but the poolside restaurant offers a variety of meals as do the ten other restaurants the hotel offers.  The Harbour bar is the best of those on offer whilst the Starboard seemed quiet all the time.  Security given the terrorist attack is significant but is not obtrusive .  There are man more modern hotels in this area of Mumbai but I suggest none with the level of service and sense of history of this hotel.
"We were visiting Mumbai and decided to visit the Sea Lounge at the Taj for High tea. The service was bad and abrupt, food mediocre and the staff were always hovering around for tips.   The sofas and table were dirty. Hotel is living of its former glory and brand name. The restaurant managers are indifferent and do not bother to see if there are glitches in the service of their staff. Sea lounge also had a musty smell and the airconditioning was not working well.  Dine or stay at the Oberoi, Four Seasons or ITC."
"A wonderful place to stay. Stunning architecture (ignoring the tower). Comfortable rooms, great service. Faultless.  Looking forward to staying again."
"Pretty much in central Mumbai, great architecture, very friendly staff and great rooms."
"I had the great pleasure of spending a week at the Taj in January for a work event and must say that it was a first class experience from the moment I arrived.  International flights can arrive very early in the morning so I had arranged for the room by paying for the prior night.  Ryan from the sales office treated me and my group like family all the way through and handled our event beautifully.  But back to the hotel experience.  Other reviewers are correct in saying that it's a dramatically different experience staying in the 'Palace' section of the hotel vs. the Tower...if possible, stay in the Palace.  I was on the top floor and had a partial sea view room which is also preferable to the garden view.  Top floor rooms don't have particularly high ceilings (lower floors are"
"We stayed for one night and had booked in for a Tower room.  However we were upgraded to a Palace suite with a magnificent view over the sea and the Gateway of India.  Despite the road being just under the window, it was quiet and very comfortable - see my wife's blog for more - http://gallivantingisadora.blogspot.com/2012/02/mumbai-taj-mahal-palace-hotel.html  The service was outstanding and the staff went to great lengths to find (successfully!) my sun glasses that I had left in the bar when we arrived.  They were very practical in their advice; for example, they did not try to push the expensively priced hotel car to go back to the airport, but told us how to get an air-conditioned taxi."
"I need to go back again and again. A snob? Yes, absolutely. Here I have the chance to be treated to the real thing a few days. From being taken into the Palace, to the room, and the sweet breakfast atmosphere to the last minutes before leaving, I happily enjoy being in one of the best hotels in the world."
This hotel is magnificent. The staff are all incredible and the level of service and attention to detail cannot be faulted. I was fortunate to be upgraded to one of the luxury suites which was the best hotel accommodation I have ever seen.   The location is excellent and my only regret is that I could only stay for one night.  I hope I get the opportunity to stay there again.
"I have stayed in a few highly ranked hotels in Mumbai but nothing can beat the Taj, I would even go there for a long week end, just amazing! Safety is very thorough, service is superb as is the food, beds excellent and good value for 5 star. Worth spending a bit more and get a deluxe room. Wine selection and cost my only criticism. Serenity inside and Indian lovely chaos within minutes outside! try the Deli Darbour for a special curry for £6. Try and include a sunday and visit the Oberoi champagne buffet Wow!!!"
A time warp and takes you bsvk to the colonial Bombay era.  So comfortable that you might feel an indulgence in a city of 20 million that has 20% slums
"This hotel was chosen by Pakistani terrorists to hurt India in Nov 2008. Non-Muslim and Western hotel guests were taken hostage and killed. Staff were killed while trying to help guests. Much property was destroyed until it was freed from their clutches by the NSG commando group which also lost lives. Many photos and accounts are available on the web about these events.   The Taj Palace at Colaba, Mumbai is an icon of Indian pride as it was built by the founding father of the Tata industrial house because he was turned out from a public serving house for being an Indian, a brown-skinned one. Royalty and heads of state and rulers of the hearts of the masses have stayed here since it started.   As guests at the same place which was held hostage, attacked and destroyed for nearly a"
"i have always wanted to visit the Gateway to India because of it's special place in history,  in the Taj I could view it from my bedroom window,  I can't praise the hotel and staff highly enough.  we had a great time"
"Beautifully designed, well maintained hotel.  It has very nice rooms and the best looking restaurants in Mumbai, though the food could have been better.   See the photo taken by my son in early 2011, with the Gateway of India in front of it, taken from a boat en route to Elephanta Caves across the harbour: http://www.anshulmanaktala.com/gallery/landscapes/content/20110208_DSC_0967_large.html"
"This is the grand old hotel of Mumbai and should be experienced at least once. Great history, though the legend about its construction may not be factual. Coveniently located, albeit at the southern tip in Colaba, about 60 minutes from the domestic airport and about 75 minutes from the international airport. Loads of good restaurants nearby, if you wish to experiment,though the hotel restaurants are also good. Good service, but most guests are here for the ambience and the tradition."
"We stayed here for a couple of nights after disembarking from the Seabourn Legend. Seabourn claims to be a 6 star experience offering the ultimate in luxury cruising service and many people would agree with that claim. Yet our stay at the Taj Palace made the Legend feel like a tramp steamer.  Let me put this in context: we were booked into the Palace or Heritage Wing and we were unexcpectedly upgraded to a club level floor, so there were 'extras' which inevitably made the whole experience more enjoyable.  Everything worked. I had booked a Hotel car to pick us up at 09.00, quayside. There it was , waiting for us, (since 06.00 - just in case). I had requested an early check-in. Not a quible - didn't even need to mention it. They were expecting us at reception and we were usherd"
"Taj palace hotel is famous for converting the old palace into a hotel. And a fantastic job they did. The hotel is visited by many celebrities from the time it was built. The palace building is absolutely stunning, beautiful. The room i stayed in (in the tower) is newer than the palace building and had a fabulous view of the gate of India.  Being a solo traveller, I booked a hotel transport from airport to the hotel. When I came out of the airport, a lovely Range Rover was waiting for me. The hotel took ~40 mins to get to. Once I got to the hotel, I was greeted by a staff who straight away took me to the room and took care of the check in process in the room.  The high tea at the sea lounge is a must as it is what it's known for in the world. Worth going there at 4-430pm to sit"
"This hotel makes you feel as if in India during the british control over it, You feel as if you are living history, The building is a palace and you served as a lord. The locatin on the coast facing India Gate is great. The staff are very profficional, helpful and elegant. The breakfast buffet is great and you will enjoy it more if you have it on the swimming pool. We tried their indian restorant and the place was casual does not fit the feeling of the palce, the food was not great, and the prices were very high. We tried the bar but it was very poor."
"The breakfast buffet was gorgious, but don't ask for indian special breakfact. It keeps on coming."
"The Taj is one of those remarkable places that almost defies description or comparison.  It is an experience - maybe even a privilege -  to stay there.  The old and new flow together quite well and there are few signs of the horrors of the 2008 attack except for the fairly heavy security.  it is at times a bit in your face but they try to keep it polite: necessary unfortunately.  Really fine restaurants, especially the Indian one where we had perhaps the best vegetarian meal in 5 weeks of Indian travel.  Staff were unfailingly polite and helpful.  Our room was in perfect condition (in new part) with a very large modern bath and balcony overlooking the Indian Gate.  Tea at the Sea Palace was charming with a traditional English service plus a buffet of Indian treats: more Indian"
"This hotel is without doubt the best i have ever stayed in. Understated elegance, in palacial surroundings. Its truly an experience."
"From start to finish, everything about this hotel is incredible.  After checking out of a very unsatisfactory hotel in southern India, we saved our vacation by settling in to the Taj.  We had  rooms on the club floor of the heritage wing with a view of Gateway of India - absolutely lovely.  The hotel staff was truly amazing - and especially solicitous of our children.  We received consistently excellent suggestions regarding restaurants and shopping.  The food at the hotel was also wonderful, we particularly enjoyed the versions of the Mumbai street food at the Sea Lounge (and not a bad view, either).  I really don't have enough praise for this hotel and its staff, will absolutely be back."
"Its only one thing to say,,PERFECT Next time i'm maybe trying to book a room in the palace building,,but its not the biggest thing,,you wil be taken great care of anyway.  Anyone having problem with this hotel is having problem with them self.  Thanx taj for a fantastic stay and hope to see soon again:-) Tchau from Ingunn & Lars "
Situated Right at the Gate Way of India. Most beautiful scenery.  It has beautiful sea views.  The interior  of the hotel is absolutely beautiful.  U can see the entire area of Colaba.  Meals are excellent.  Rooms are spacious.  The staff are very friendly.
"My long time desire to be staying at Taj, Mumbai got fulfilled the other day when on a business trip the opportunity came my way. It is the Leading Hotel of the World and favourite destination for discerning business travellers.  My suite overlooked the grand Gateway of India and beyond into the rising waves of the Arabian sea, that continue changing the colors, as if showing the true culture of this mighty hotel. A treasure-trove of invaluable memorabilia, there is a story to tell behind every pillar, a landmark deal in every boardroom, and a storied celebration under every awning. The  Hotel excels in its facilities and services which is the perfect blend of international comfort and traditional styles.The assortment of dining extravaganza is unparalleled. I particularly liked"
"Maybe I would have scored this hotel more if I hadn't stayed at other Taj properties as part of my holiday  The hotel is spectacular with a huge range of facilities that encourage you to spend time there but the service is a real let-down. There are nowhere near enough sunbeds around the pool, the Spa was fully booked for treatments (they eventually arranged a massage for me in a disused bedroom), the high-tea is full of tourists and they won't let residents reserve tables and worst of all the staff hover for tips. I only stayed 3 nights and the room cleaner ""bumped"" in to me at least 10 times. This was not good service; this was purely an exercise in getting tips.  The Palace Lounge, which provides free cocktails to Club Room guests each evening has no cocktail menu. The staff"
"I have stayed at the Taj Palace at various times since 1984. It was always a rare treat, comparable to the historic hotels of the world. This time, the hotel service was abyssmal. My colleagues commented similarly. The staff simply did not have answers to even simple questions like when breakfast is served.   To be sure, the ambience, location and people watching make this hotel a ""must stay at"" for the visitor who can afford it. Perhaps we came at the wrong time, but we were truly baffled that the service would be as disappointing as it was.   In addition, the breakfast buffet offered in the Sea Lounge was also disappointing. The selection was poor and we had to track down a cook to make an omelet. The service was also slow, to the point that we had to leave for an appointment"
"This TAJ i wanted stay since long being symbolic hotel and identity of INDIA, The fascinating outside look but disappointed since check in. This may be the worst among all TAJ properties or may be i expected it to be best and did not fulfill my expectations whatever... my kid checked in earlier with my brother and when i arrived finishing my work the hotel staff was too busy to guide me what way should i go to find my room. May be it was Friday evening so everybody busy attending pag3 party people.. Room is of very old style and to my surprise i found a hole in curtain of my room. I am confused whether they want to maintain the heritage or it is careless maintenance? The movement in the lobby and hotel is crowded no proper signs diversifying two building which they call as mahal"
"On recent family trip to Mumbai we treated ourselves to a 6 night stay at the Taj Palace. For its location and grand character appeal you just cant go wrong with this hotel. Enter through its doors and you are immediatley transported to a place of majesty and the staff will do all they can to ensure that you are made to feel like royalty. In the seven days of our vist I cannot recall  ever being refused a request. Of all that the Taj has going for it their staff are indeed at the top of that list, beautiful, obliging special human beings. It is best to stay in the Taj old wing as the ""new"" wing needs refreshing. Afternoon drinks at the poolside is a must, as is coffee at the coffee shop on the second floor of the old wing were you can take in the drama that unfolds in and around"
"It was my dream  come true when I stayed at this hotel. Although this Hotel has had its share of grief in the past but it was wonderful to see it revive its spirit and structure.The hospitality was wonderful and worth applauding . The staff very professional , friendly and courteous.The view from the hotel is breathtaking with Gateway of India and the beautiful sea shore on the other side.Great food and nice ambiance.Would love to come back here."
"The service, ambience, facilities, amneties, cleaniness etc exceeded all our expectations. we left the hotel speechless, a must stay for anyone visiting mumbai, the locations is nearyby Kolaba street which is filled with street market like shopping. the Gateway to india is next to the main hotel entrance. we spent new years eve here and wow what a night to remember. I am a south african and extremly glad to hear that the Taj group have opended up a hotel in Cape Town our mother city and will definately be staying there."
"We stayed at the Taj for five nights in the old wing which has an excellant character to admire. Very comfortable room with good facilities. They need to provide free WiFi facilities in the room. Very nice buffet breakfast with a good mix of varieties of food and drinks. Fresh fruit juices were excellant. Very friendly  staff with prompt services,nice shopping archade and in a very good location near Gate Way of India. The sea view is excellant."
"Unparalled Indian hospitality. Beautiful surroundings. Unbeatable locatioon.Literally a dream hotel. I got upgraded upon request. Got a late checkout upon request. And anything else I requested was granted.  The pool was reminiscent of the Chateau Marmont. The staff was charming and attractive.  I can go on and on about the greatness of this hotel.  Oh, and Oprah was staying here when I was here, and there wasn't a feeling of anything than excitement in the air.  I will stay here over and over again when I return to Mumbai.   Thank you!"
"I defy anyone who has travelled extensively to find fault with this hotel.  We were in the new wing and had a lovely room overlooking the water. I am sure the old wing is grander – but it could not have bettered our service or even our view.  It seems that almost everyone knows your name once you have been there half an hour.   When we checked out one of the front of house staff came from to the front of the counter making time to ask us which facilities we had used and how we found them. We had our photo taken and received, within 24 hours, an email with the photo, and hoping they’d looked after us with perfection.  As we cannot find anything less than 100% perfect to mention we’ll add two tips.  Tip One. If you plan to use one of the specialist restaurants do make a booking."
"We stayed for about four days on the sixth floor of the Taj Palace and the room was very comfortable, charming and with a nice view of the pool.  The marble bathroom was exquisite and the television in the mirror was quite fun while one  soaked in the bath.  The Sea Lounge serves a good buffet breakfast but I noticed that each morning many people had to wait for up to an hour before being able to get a table and this is totally unacceptable.  During busy times such as Christmas/New Year other arrangements should be made as the service can be quite impersonal and this is not satisfactory for a hotel of this calibre.  The pool also posed a problem - gorgeous, big pool but not enough deck chairs so if you didn't  rush to grab a spot (not the sort of thing one should have to do"
"I just returned from a two and a half day stay in Mumbai and was so glad I chose to stay at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel instead of the other hotel I originally picked.  I was also glad I chose the palace room with a sea view instead of the tower, as I really felt special staying in that historic old building and the room had a view of the Gateway of India that was second to none, especially at daybreak.  The hotel is in a wonderful location with plenty of touristy shopping close by and not far from many of the sights.  But you could easily spend your entire visit and never leave the hotel, as there are many bars and restaurants to try, a selection of up-market shops and a fabulous spa with plenty of gorgeous treatments on offer.  The pool area is also a haven of calm in the"
The rooms are ok but the service is fantastic - from the front desk to the restaurants. The gym is small and hot though. Location and views are excellent. A beautiful pool area.   I was there on business - wireless and business centre use are expensive.
"Great service, great rooms, great location, but why on earth in a hotel of this stature do they still charge for wi fi!? Not even complimentary in lobby etc. Seriously let down by this, the staff at check in did not make me aware of this, they simply told me how to access the service."
"The service is outstanding, the quality of food is very very good but sometimes, it's a little bit over priced. There are 5 restaurant of different cuisine. The rooms in the palace are the best. The pool is very nice and quite."
"We were 2 adults and 2 children (age 7 and 5) travelling in India for 1 month. We stayed 1 night at the Taj Mahal Palace at the end of our trip.  The Taj is a fantastic place. We had booked a room to treat ourselves at the end of our trip. And treated we got: This hotel is nothing but pure luxury from you enter till you leave. We were even lucky to get upgraded from the Tower to the Palace.   Everything is nice at the Taj: The rooms are clean, spacious, carefully decorated and contains all amenities. The exteriors and interiors of the hotel justifies the ""Palace"" in the name. The garden, the pool and the spa facilities are wonderful. And it is situated right next to The Geteway to India in the cosy neighborhood of Colaba in southern Mumbai.  The service is fantastic. Even though"
"From the moment we walked in until the moment we left everything from the check-in, food, service, etc were very much five star.  It's in an excellent location on the waterfront and security if very thorough as you would expect.  Highly recommended."
"If you are visitng India & specially Mumbai, this is one place you wanna check out...! It is definitely expensive but worthwhile. It has so much histroy attached to it. The old wing was built around the year1903 and the new one around 1975.  Our room had a breathtaking view of the famous monument, ""The Gateway of India"" and the harbour with tourist boats and private boats steaming around at a distance. There are plenty of Food & Beverage outlets to choose from & room service is excellent. The service is immaculate from the time of the check-in till check-out..."
"My stay at the Taj was one of the most memorable hotel experiences I've ever had. The check-in was like nothing I'd ever experienced. We didn't stand at a counter in the lobby, instead they walked us down to a beautiful room where we sat with a staff member at a huge desk while they brought us a glass of champagne. When done, we walked through the gorgeous marble stairs in to a room facing the Gateway of India. It was the most beautiful scene I've ever witnessed outside my hotel window (and I've been in some amazing places around the world)."
"The Taj is one of the best hotel experiences ive ever had. From the moment you are picked up from the airport to the time you check out the experience is wonderful. The staff is always helpful every step of the way and go above and beyond. The hotel is beautiful and rooms are very well kept. The restaurants and pool are also a great addition to this hotel.   It is expensive but the value is clearly shown through the ever day workings of the hotel. If you want to have a comfortable, problem free, relaxing stay in Mumbai this is the place to go.  Go to Kulaba Causeway just a few minutes walk from the hotel for some good shopping and great food. If you dont have a driver, taxis are the cheapest and best way to get around the city, you can get some right outside the hotel.   The"
"We stayed 5 nights in this hotel on our first leg of our India backpacking journey. The hotel is opulent but a great way to acclimatize yourself to the Indian way by allowing you to dip in an out of Mumbai as you please. The rooms are very well kept and you have a number of options available for you in terms of food - we had breakfast buffet included in our rates and took advantage of that but generally ate out - only had one meal in the hotel, which was also nice (but pricy). The last night there we visited both the Harbour and Sealounge bar in the hotel - they provide drinks at Western prices but the attention to detail is second to none - and you have the added bones of unlimited (salty, of course ;-) snacks while there. One word of warning: the Kingfisher served as lager is"
The most amazing stay ever with the best food! You should definitely try out all of the restaurants. The shopping stores are amazing. The amazing view of the sea just adds to the beauty. It is definitely worth a spend.
"Take the title with a pinch of salt, but given our experiences at the Taj in Mumbai, you'd understand why we were in 'heaven'.  We had had trouble at previous hotels during our stay in India and the manager in Udaipur called ahead to Mumbai alerting them of our arrival. From there it was heaven and I'm not exaggerating.  Try to book a room at the Palace wing and just immerse yourself in the experience. We were lucky to be upgraded to a rather (very) large suite (Rajput Suite), and were pampered by the staff from morning to night.  The Japanese restaurant served the best vegetarian meal I've ever had and the Chinese restaurant, where we went for lunch had some amazing dumplings. None of these restaurants are cheap, but the quality is there.  Room for improvement?  Definitively:"
"The Palace wing of the Taj is truly one of the great hotels of the world. best location, best service, it is truly remarkable. The sea view rooms are worth the price, but the club rooms are not."
"It was beautiful, relaxing and fun. Beautiful scenery, relaxing facilities and fun places nearby to visit within walking distance."
"This is a grand hotel and everyone should spend at least one night at the Taj Palace. Not only is the Palace Wing spectacular but the level of service from all the Palace staff is professional, friendly and immaculate.  Our first stay was post attack in the Tower Block as the Palace Wing was still closed. The downstairs shops and the pool area were open and hinted at the grandeur of this wing so we were lucky enough to book a suite for the re-opening. The suite was incredibly well decorated, on the top floor of the palace with its own balcony, an office and had a great heritage feel. During our stay we watched a documentary on the attacks and to our surprise we were in the very suite with flames pour out from the balcony. It really helped us appreciate the huge effort in"
"The service is the best, the restaurants are all delicious, the grounds are manicured perfectly and the entire hotel is amazing; you feel like royalty as soon as you walk through the doors. The sea view rooms have a much better view of the Gateway but all rooms have the same beds, the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on (we didn't want to leave our room because they were so great). There's great shopping two blocks behind the hotel and it seems like the hotel is the center of the tourist area (which is great if you're a tourist). There's a cab stand on the side of the hotel where you can negotiate a much better rate for your ride than one provided by the hotel."
"Stayed here for 4 nights in January 2012. The first night we had rooms in the Tower. The Tower and the Palace share the same entrance , pool and restaurants but that's where the similarity ends. These are actually like 2 separate hotel worlds apart in luxury.   I would rate the Tower as a 4 star at most ( more likely 3 star ).  We moved to the Palace the second day. What a difference.  The Palace is outstanding. The best of the best in luxury and service. Location is perfect and the immediate area can be explored easily without a guide which is quite unique for India. Beautiful pool and gardens to relax.  Excellent restaurants and amazing buffet breakfast.  Would certainly return and look forward to it."
"Lovely hotel, attentive service, good gym and spa facilities. Excellent driver provided for city tour. Pay the extra and get sea view room on club floor. View incredible of Gateway of India, club room services really useful. Spa treatments good and reasonable. I would stay there again."
"I finished a 3 week trip to India with a final night of luxury.  Booked a Palace room which in itself would have been lovely but I was fortunate to be upgraded to a Taj Suite on the 6th floor.  Wow!  Absolutely beautiful room with exquisite facilities, gorgeous fluffy pillows on the bed and a room I could have spent a week in.  The staff across the hotel from reception, concierge, Club Lounge are wonderful and nothing is too much trouble.  My butler, Jaswin, was a lovely man and again, anything I asked was responded to promptly and efficiently.  The building is beautifully restored following previous events and I was fortunate enough to join one of the hotel tours on offer at 5.00 pm each evening from the Palace Reception which allowed an excellent look into the history of the"
"This hotel isn't the flashest in Bombay by any means and it isn't the best value either BUT it is definitely worth a stay just for the atmosphere and the history which drips from every wall. Pay the extra and get a sea view room as the view of the Gateway of India is incredible.  The hotel has a decent restaurant but you can eat better elsewhere in just a few minutes walk but that's not why you stay in a hotel like this.. The gardens and the pool are also a reall treat from the madness that lies just beyond the hotel walls. Oh, don't let the fact that this was the scene of the infamous terrorist shootings put you off."
Right across from Gateway of India and in close proximity to shopping areas.  The rooms were spacious and clean.
"I live in Bombay, now Mumbai. We have had all our major celebrations at Taj in its restaurants and Part rooms. The service has always been magnificent. The Executive Chef Oberoi has been very helpful always to make a unique menu for us. I have stayed at Taj of few occasions and have found the rooms and Suits very well appointed and the service very good. The Old Tas now called Taj Palace is really a Palace. Just wonderful."
"It is amazing that this building in Mumbai is the way it is - the architecture, the stores inside the hotel, there's even a bakery, the location: think of a hotel in the City, at India Gate, overlooking the sea and in the middle of the city at the same time. There was a food festival for a few nights because of the holiday season which was quite interesting.  The place is very very busy. There are other eating places and shops within walking distance of the hotel for those who like to shop and try other foods.  This property is called the ""Flagship"" of  the properties of the Taj chain of hotels in Mumbai. However, I was very very very disappointed with the service.  I think this hotel is overpopulated and the hotel is very short-staffed. I do not know if it was because I was"
"We stayed only a couple of nights in this amazing hotel however it was well worth the stopover in Mumbai! We loved the hotel so much we barely left!  From our collection at the airport to the check in at the hotel to being shown to our rooms the service was seamless and the staff were all helpful and friendly. In fact all of the staff that we saw during our stay (from the porters to the housekeeping to the concierge) were all incredibly friendly and helpful. top marks for service! The drivers even helped make the trip that much more enjoyable pointing out various points of interest and giving fascinating facts etc.  The rooms were all well kept and spacious with great attention to detail and a good array of amenities including a shaving set, sewing kit, toothbrush and toothpaste"
"Had an absolutely fantastic stay here.  First, this building is an amazing architectural icon.   Every step you take in this hotel provides marvels to view.   The location is excellent;  within easy walking distance to the Gateway of India, the Prince of Wales museum, and many restaurants, shops and markets.  The service is impeccible.   There was no request or special challenge which was beyond the staff of the hotel.  I had forgotten to bring my battery charger.   The conceriege hunted the appropriate one down from an electronic store and delivered it to me.    The room was quite large and as beautiful as the building overall.   We had a pool view as well as a view of two of the iconic wings of the hotel.  Breakfast was quite good.   The coffee shop where breakfast is has"
"From the moment we arrived, the service we received was exceptional.  The detailing and obvious care was applied from breakfast, arranging a car and guide, or when needing help from the bell-boy. We had a lovely room in the old part of the hotel, all so beautifully restored since the islamic terrorist attack. The decor, the ambience, the ever-present service, made this a wonderful stay of five days. Full marks to the management!"
"I stayed here for a week with my family while we attended a wedding in Mumbai.  We were treated like royalty.  Stayed in the heritage wing with rooms overlooking the Gateway to India. The service was impeccable, the rooms superb: the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in; the aircon was effective but quiet; and the quality of sleep I enjoyed there was second to none.  The hotel restaurants were extremely good (but pricey even by London standards).  Highly recommended."
"I can't  recommend this hotel enough. All of the staff were friendly and helpful, the facilities are superb, and the building is beautiful.  The cocktails are top notch and the buffet breakfast, which was included in our room rate, has to be seen to be believed. "
"We stayed in the old wing (heritage wing) and enjoyed every moment. The staff was extremely well trained, actually more alert and up to speed with everything. The Gym was great, the pool as always beautiful and the rooms nicely decorated with excellent WiFi speed. Never so fast in India."
"This is a fabulous hotel.  The physical plant is just incredible.  The surroundings are really off putting.   India is just decreipt and dirty and crowded.  And this hotel, even for as high end as it is, is surrounded up to its property walls, with decreipt, dirty and crowded surroundings.    When y ou come into the main lobby,  which mainly serves the Tower wing, it is wildly chaotic.  Large numbers of people moving around.  This hotel is evidently quite the place for upwardly mobile upper class families in India to visit and be seen, and the public areas are filled with these folks swanning around.    Then you get to the reception area of the Palace wing.  Much calmer.    The architecture is gorgeous.  We had booked two interconnecting ""luxury grande sea view rooms"" for our"
"My wife and I have stayed at wonderful, highly rated hotels throughout the world, including the Oriental in Bangkok. None exceeds the Taj Palace. The level of service simply can not be any better than what we experienced earlier this month. The young men and women we had the pleasure of interacting with were truly dedicated to ensuring all our needs were met ... or exceeded. The hiring and training process must be something special!  Literally everyone was friendly and gracious. As everyone knows, the hotel was 75 percent destroyed in a terrorist attack, and was closed for two years. The rebuilding is a triumph of spirit over evil. Good for the Taj and the people of Mumbai. The hotel is, of course, beautiful. The lobby and other public spaces, the pool, the library are all"
"Incredible hotel. As many other reviewers have noted, the service was absolutely exceptional: the fresh flowers and 'towel elephant' in the room were nice touches. Great gym and an incredible breakfast buffet (comparable to the buffet at the Shangri-La, Hong Kong). The only minor downside was expensive wifi."
"We recently stayed at The Taj Mahal Palace hotel for two nights.   We stayed in the palace section (not the tower).  Words can't describe how beautiful it was.   Nothing was too much trouble for the wonderful staff.   Breakfast was fantastic.   Be aware of the balloon sellers across the road at the Gateway to India, they will get you ;-)"
"Lovely location and very good hotel. The reason I give it a 4* instead of a 5 is because the waiting staff were a bit uncaring in the shamiana breakfast area and the yacht that was advertised on their website was unavailable. However, the rest of the things were wonderful and it was a haven from all the heat, and the hustle and bustle of mumbai. The front desk and concierge etc were v good and I recommend this hotel."
"Magnificent personalised service in a top quality excellently maintained establishment.  It could be fairly described as a beautiful peaceful oasis in a massive city swarming with humanity and traffic It is situated opposite the India Gate and adjacent to the sea  The check-in was streamlined and hassle free, the concierge service was superb, so too housekeeping..The rigorous security procedures were reassuring and gave us full confidence. The breakfast was excellent offering an opportunity to experiment with Indian food as well as offering a wide western menu.  We organised guides and chauffer driven cars through the hotel travel desk on arrival.  The guides were highly educated, informed and articulate and very well versed in working with westerners. The hotel embodies the"
"My family and I recently stayed at the Taj in Mumbai and we were overwhelmed by the service that was provided by the staff. The kindness, sincerity and effieciency of the staff is outstanding and this made our stay a memorable one. All the staff from the cleaning team to the Butlers went out of their way to ensure that we were happy. Every request from finding a simple telephone number to providing our choice of fruit in the room was catered for and provided. This hotel has a rich heritage, history and culture. The heritage walk with Viren was entertaining and informative. Our Butlers Deepak and Adrian were extremely professional, wonderful and are  absoluetely great at what they do. I was very touched and moved with the devotion and commitement of Dinesh, an elderly gentlemen"
"This truly is one of the great hotels of the world--or at least of Asia.  It really is two adjoining hotels--the new one and the old one.  The new one, where we stayed, is functional and efficient.  The old one is beautiful--almost breathtaking.  You truly get a sense of colonial history here.  In regards to amenities....the fitness center is fabulous--the best in Asia from my experience.  The setting for the swimming pool is idylic, in a beautiful garden setting, although the water is COLD.    One warning regarding the restaurants: the prices are high, like Manhattan high.  We had dinner one night in the Lebanese restaurant on the highest floor in the tower.  The view was spectacular, and the food was great.    One obvious concern at the Taj--given its history--is security.  We"
"Not stayed here since before the fire. We booked it with some trepidation, we needn't of bothered. Everything was as good as before and the staff were brilliant, friendly and efficient. The pool area has actually improved. "
Staying at The Taj Palace in Mumbai was an absolute pleasure. Here are all the great things about staying there: - amazing service. All of the staff speak perfect English and are always wanting to please and be of help.  - beautiful facilities and restaurants. Absolutely gorgeous facility with a huge pool and lounge area. There are many restaurants to choose from all with excellent food.  - great location. This hotel is in the heart of Mumbai right across from the water and in a very safe tourist location.   The only minor bad element of the hotel was : - hotel rooms were average.  - WIFI costs money approx 12 American dollars a day. 
"Awesome !! Beautiful !! Fantastic!! These words are apt to use to describe the stay in this hotel. The food is very delicious and suits the people of different categories. The waiters and house keeping folks are very friendly and helpful during our stay. The view is of course breath taking . We were given the room on 15th floor , and i felt it as a King's stay. Though the ceiling and everything looks a bit old , but the quality and hygene are not compromised at all. As usual , the maintainence and services are in par with their brand name. I was given the initial stay here , when i completely moved to mumbai. I felt the royal pleasure , during my stay."
"I was traveling with friends to India for our first time for a friends wedding. We decided to stay st the Taj after reading so many great reviews not only on trip advisor but also in multiple travel magazines. They did not disappoint!  From the second we walked in the staff was beyond helpful and they made our stay an extremely memorable one. They not only arranged for a tailor to come and make the blouse for my sari, but they made multiple reservations, would suggest places to see, grout up cute little candle gifts for us on Christmas day and one of the staff members even came up to help my friend and I get in our sari's for the wedding.   We had considered booking somewhere else that was a little bit less expensive, but the service you receive and the atmosphere at the hotel"
"My sister and I stayed at the Taj Palace for four memorable nights. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to the Palace and were treated to a twenty- four hour Butler. the facilities offered is par excellence. The complimentary toiletries are locally sourced and are of the highest quality.The breakfast is delectable and their own branded tea only adds to one's treat. I have stayed at other Taj Hotels in India, but this is the hotel I would recommend. The hotel is well appointed and the view is breathtaking. A must  add on the bucket-list, for the discerning traveller."
"This is supposed to be a heritage site for Mumbai, and by the look of my room, it may be.  It looked and felt very old, with quite a low ceiling.  since i choose smoking room, i was booked to 17 fl (?).  you wont missed it, the tobacco smells will caught you right after you step out from the lift. the breakfast was decent."
"I believe the Taj Mahal Palace hotel is must for travellers who enjoy the finer things in life. It is an absolutely spectacular place. The staff are true ambassadors for the Taj- they personify hospitality at its best. The layout, the room, facilities , food - all that is offered is second to none! The Palace lounge is a novel experience - especially with the butler service - those guys are awesome. The High Tea and breakfast at the Sea Lounge - is a relaxing experience especially as you enjoy your time of being there and watching life go by. Spolit for choice in the restaurants that are available. Love their bookstore(Nalanda) and a business centre that is so well equipped. Sitting on the veranda by the pool in the evenings is absolute bliss.The depth of the history and"
"We loved our stay at the Taj Palace.  It feels like you are back in the colonial times of India and if you have the time, take the 5pm tour of the hotel.  Our young guide was so enthusiastic and well-informed and we saw places and rooms we would have never ventured in to.  Our room was in the original part of the hotel, which is what we requested when we booked and I was much happier to be there instead of the uninspiring newer wing.  Dinner outside in the courtyard was delicious and you could order freshly grilled choices that were cooked to your specifications.  The breakfast buffet was enormous and had a vast array of all types of foods, both western and Indian along with custom eggs and anything else you could possibly think of. Service was very friendly and efficient and"
"The second time around at this superb place was as amazing as the first. The room was beautiful and the peace, once inside is rejuvenating. The pool is sparkling clean and Jiva Spa is refreshingly awesome. I would love to stay here again and again. For the price that one pays the amenities the Hotel offers is totally justified. The staff is very polite and sweet. It was my wife's birthday and the housekeeping had decorated the room with balloons and gave us a bottle of wine. Hotel staff knows how to please their guests with their hospitality and warmth.  Souk- Restaurant at the top floor has the best lunch in Mumbai, of course if one has a palate for mediterranean cuisine. A definite visit.  Super Highly Recommended."
"taj palace as the name stands is truly a palace, what you could see in movies. all the amenities are truly palatial. the adjoining tower is much recently built and complements the old palace hotel.  from the 15th floor of the tower, the gateway of india, the ships in the sea and the movement is truly granderistic. Ofcourse the per night charges are truly high, but if you get a good package, you could afford the rooms.  But the presidential suites are out of affordability, only for ministers, presidents and celebrities."
"The history of Mumbai and The Taj Mahal Palace are dramatically intertwined. The hotel is Mumbai’s first harbour landmark (built 21 years before the Gateway of India) and the site of the first licensed bar in the city. For more than a century, the Taj has played an intrinsic part in the life of the city, hosting Maharajas, dignitaries and eminent personalities from across the globe. Today it is a Leading Hotel of the World and favourite destination for discerning business travellers.   A treasure-trove of invaluable memorabilia, there is a story to tell behind every pillar, a landmark deal in every boardroom, and a storied celebration under every awning. Come be a part of the legendBuilt in 1903, The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai is the flagship hotel of the Taj Hotels, Resorts and"
"Impeccable service, wonderful location...India at its best..."
"Second stay - last one in 2006.  Room 1601 One of the cheaper rooms, still nice. Smallish bath, nice amenities, great service. One small issue - it is right next to the lift shaft (right next to) and you DO hear the lift travelling up and down. I mentioned this to the hotel - they moved me to 426 in the old palace. Super room, everything in it of great quality. Nice very high ceilings.  Breakfast is super, service, food quality, everything. The pool area is just greatr to sit around, have a drink, something to eat. Spa - I had a steam room, sauna, swim. Nice changing room, great service again.  Just a great place to stay."
"The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel was without a doubt my hotel experience of a lifetime to date.  The ambience and rooms are just superb, and the staff are absolutely polite and attentive.  This ranged from the car that met us at the airport, through to check-in and the housekeeping staff.  Inside the hotel are a range of bars and restaurants, all of the highest quality."
"Stayed here twice as a end to backpacking around India.  What a treat.  Pure luxury.  The staff are so so helpful, considerate and go out of their way to go that extra mile.  Nothing is too much trouble.    Take the free palace tour and enjoy a complimentary glass of Indian champagne to finish!"
"We only went for a lunch, which was very well affordable (approx 20 euro pp) If you have a couple of hours, go to the sea lounge restaurant on the 1st floor, and enjoy the buffet style lunch.  It's a real treat (especially after traveling through India...) with all the high quality food. We spent a couple of hours eating, drinking and enjoying the magnificent views on ocean and Gateway of India. So if you don't spend the nights here, at least go for a fantastic lunch."
"This is a fantastic Hotel that in many respects redefines what service is all about.  It is a true Mumbai classic with real genuine charater and a must stay if you can afford it and the location is suitable to what you want to do.  This is simply the best tourist location in Mumbai and a good location for business if contacts around Narriman Point but NOT so good for the BKC.  It is also just about as far away from the airport as you can get in Mumbai.  As regards rooms, I prefer the old part of the hotel as it has real character.  I am not so keen on the rooms in the ""newer"" part of hotel which are a bit small and somewhat characterless."
Excellent place to stay in the heart of mumbai. You can see the famous Gateway of India from the hotel Big pool and very neat place. The way they treat small children who stay is really commendable. Very nice coffee shop and the evening we had been there and looking out and watching the Gateway Of India is a very memorable one. Courteous staff and very good service all through. I would like to go and stay back there when I visit Mumbai next time
"The Hotel is well known globally when the US president Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton during their visit to Mumbai stayed in this Hotel. Situated in front of the Gateway of India, one can have a very nice view from the room if you have choosen a sea facing room. Welcomed in a very cultural way, each and every guest feels special and proud in the hotel. Roof Top restaurant is definitely worth for a dinner. Right from the beginning of landing at the airport till one leaves the city, the feel of Taj will be there in terms of welcome and see off at the airport also. A must stay at the Pride of India!"
View from the hotel is breath taking... You can see the Gateway of India on front side of the hotel and building is still old Victorian style looks which differentiate from any other hotel in Mumbai. Located in the heart of Mumbai and most spectacular view is at night. Staff is most courteous and welcoming their guest.
Charmed is an understatement when you visit this  property. Majestic Gateway of India acts as pseudo entry for this well known hotel which was almost destroyed by enemies of humanity at large. What enamored me was the hospitality at it's best where you are treated as if you've among family and looked after very well. rooms still hold old charm though the windows are covered with irritating wires obstructing beautiful view ( to avoid pigeons & may be terrorists as guests). Overall a must visit hotel once in lifetime and if get a room overlooking the Gateway you've got a deal for sure.
"the second The taj of India is the Taj MAHAL PALACE APPOLO BUNDER, the Enterance lobby itself explain you everything the fabulous veiw of arabian see and gateway , once you are at the terrace of your room you can view the dream of century old Mumbai , you can imagine the joy of the city the date it was inaugurated by TATAS And the present , No matter what happend on 26/11 but still it stands proud AND is giving excellent service and hospitality to its customers, when i travelled the lobby is designed with fresh yellow flowers and they made rabit with fresh flowers, i loved it very much , will travel again and again........"
Excellent Service & Location with good service and good food quality. Excellent Service & Location with good service and good food quality. Excellent Service & Location with good service and good food quality.
"Excelelnt Ambience. Beautiful Palace,Awesome food,love to be be visiting the property again. I loved the flower decoration. Very Nice Swimming Pool. The Royal red Carpet flowing across on the staircase. Very Nice Jewellery Shops and Retail Outlets."
"A late review but I was compelled to write something about the Taj Mahal in Mumbai. A fantastic jewel overlooking the Gateway to India - outside a mass of people, colours, sights, sound and smells -  and extremes of wealth and poverty. The hotel itself is stunning and everything is immaculate. Excellent facilities and rooms. The staff are amazing - natural and enthusiastic. Whatever position they all wanted to help and they were both attentive and interested in you as a guest.  I have this as my number one hotel for service !!   If you have to stay in this remarkable city there is only one place to stay !!"
"The Hotel is well known globally when the US president Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton during their visit to Mumbai stayed in this Hotel. Situated in front of the Gateway of India, one can have a very nice view from the room if you have choosen a sea facing room. Welcomed in a very cultural way, each and every guest feels special and proud in the hotel. Roof Top restaurant is definitely worth for a dinner. Right from the beginning of landing at the airport till one leaves the city, the feel of Taj will be there in terms of welcome and see off at the airport also. A must stay at the Pride of India!"
"Word's can not describe the impression,that this amazing place left in me and I suppose in many others!Beautifully,spectacular design and decoration.And one of the most importaint is service!! The staff,which predict your next move and are there to assist and help you.The only stuff I saw,who are proud and sincerely happy to be part of this hotel. I'm not talking about small gifts that you will find every time you return to the room. It feels like Christmas there! Very,very recommended"
"We had booked this trip a few days before the Mumbai Bombings happened; we decided to go in the end, we didn't regret.  Once we arrived at MUM, a Taj rep came to greet us and took us to the hotel car which was a 4WD, after going through layers of security checks at the hotel, we were taken straight up to our Club Room 559 to do the check in procedures.  Our room looked directly at the Gateway Of India, you can see all the street life down there from the comfort of the room, the room has got a door that can be closed to separate the sleeping and the entrance areas, the bath is all marble and has a shower and a bath tub. All the furniture inside the room is of utmost high quality, the ceiling is a little bit low though, there is a bottle of wine on the table and we cannot wait to"
"This time we stayed in the old part of the hotel. We booked a Taj-Mahal-Palace room and not a Taj-Mahal-Tower room. Our room with views over the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea was fabulous. We were very impressed and humble about the enormous efforts and works done after the terrorist attacks in 2008. The ""old"" rooms have been completely restored with the perfect mix of old heritage interior design and today's modern amenities. Accompanied by highly attentive room service and many small details like welcome letters, guest presents, fruits, flowers, and many more. Visit the top floor of the tower - stunning views! Very nice room for a conference. Shopping in the hotel's arcade is good (same prices as elsewhere) and less hectic than outside the hotel.  Famous pool area might"
"Everything you would expect from surely one of the most special hotels in the world. Lovely rooms, spa, pool & public areas, great service and location. If it is too much to stay pop in for Afternoon Tea. Wonderful dining room with great views and exquisit high tea - great value & you won't need dinner!"
"This is the best hotel ever! Amazing service, great location! This property has charm and personality! Loved it! Will definitely come back!"
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai.We were a little disappointed after the amazing hotels we had stayed in elsewhere. it is 5 star luxury but it is impersonal and does not have the same ambiance that the leela and Oberoi hotels achieve. We were in the modern skyscraper block withe most amazing view over 'the Gateway to India' built to honour of the attendance of George V. We did not discover the fabulous public rooms and public areas until just before we left. They had forgotten to tell about the tour of the hotel.maybe we should have paid more!Despit its wonderful position, i preferred the Leela and Oberoi hotels."
Average hotel not what we expected. Only 20 sunbeds  ridiculous for the size of hotel. Housekeeping staff good. Reception inefficient and snobby. Room ( in Tower ) functional not luxurious.
This got to be the best. Service is fantastic - no way you'll find a better location across the Gate of India. The rooms are beautiful - you never want to leave.  Enjoy tea at the exclusive lounge. The swimming pool is one of the largest in Mumbai. The gym is average . Restaurants are exclusive and excellent.
"Delightful hotel, large but with sufficient rooms for you not to notice. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and the food, though expensive, is of a high standard. We stayed in the Palace suites and I recommend that, as the separate check-in, lounge bar and free food and drinks are worth it - though actually we did not pay extra as asked for and got an upgrade."
"We stayed in the Palace hotel itself, on the 6th floor in a room overlooking the water.  It was a very comfortable blend of  tradtional styling with modern conveniences. Immaculately clean and beautifully appointed, it was quiet  and stylish. There was adequate wardrobe space and a modern, classy bathroom. It was a pleasure to come back to at the end of busy days sightseeing.  The staff, ever helpful and charming, seem effortlessly efficient and nothing was too much bother. ( I commented that I enjoyed a particular local dish, and was presented with a copy  - handwritten - of the recipe by one of the servers!)  The breakfast buffet in the Sea Lounge was great and eating al fresco on the guest only patio overlooking the pool was  wonderful too.  The pool is beautiful, by the way,"
"We expected much from this hotel but were very disappointed.  The check in was very inefficient and we were not shown, or told about, any of the facilities (perhaps the staff need to visit the Leela Palace, Udaipur).  The room, although it had great views overlooking the Gateway to India, was tiny - we found ourselves dancing round each other when trying to move around and the only mirror was in the bathroom.  Finally the pool......... for a hotel of this size to have only 20 loungers round the pool is ridiculous.  The most disappointing hotel of the five we visited on our three week trip."
"The Typical Taj Service is TO DIE FOR, but the palace post renovations is only good for the suites, the rooms are tiny and uncomfortable. The state of the art entertainment system is complex and not user friendly. The climate control system made my nose bleed and the room service was average. For the most posh hotel in India, this is a place to visit, but not stay. The restaurants and shopping and service are the envy of the Orient"
"If you are in this part of INDIA -You must stay at this hotel – even if it’s just for one night it is more than worth the price We stayed for four nights – it was a fabulous experience Yes we stayed in the front (sea facing rooms) in the original part of the hotel, you would never know that they had ever had problem as large as they did have"
"The Taj Palace is just beautiful.  Our room in the somewhat less pricey tower looked out over the harbor and was very splendid. We took the hotel's complimentary tour of the old and new hotel areas and it was fabulous to see the old sections and learn the history of Tata and his hotel. The staff couldn't be nicer, food was good and the location superb."
"Had rooms facing the Gateway to India, great rooms, bathrooms on the small size but efficient. Ate a very expensive and disapointing dinner at the Souk, but the restaurant manager and somelier were impecable at offering a nice complimentary wine bottle after going through 3 bottles and sending them back since the wines were too oxidized to be palatable. We took the 5 PM tour of the first palace, led by an over enthousiastic employee. The pool area is beautiful. From the hotel you can go out on your own to visit the area. Do not start to look at the wares that the street sellers have to offer, there are too many of them who will quickly surround you. And be prepared to see homeless families, women with babies, littering on the sidewalks. But no agressive beggars."
"This is one of the best hotels i have visited in India during my business trips. A very luxurious hotel with beautiful rooms. The service is also excellent with promptness. The whole building is well maintained. Also, the south side has good view of the gateway of India. Overall a very good place to stay in"
"Large rooms really Maharaja style. Similar treatment at the reception too.. maybe it was because of the upgrade but the feeling was nice. Great breakfast, customised a dish and got it for me with a smile. Check out too was very smooth. Location is close to the old Business district, but far from the airport."
"We had a suite in the original hotel and found it to be terrific.  The rooms are very comfortable and quiet and the the service was great.  The management of this hotel is top notch.  Two suggestions: (1) stay in the Palace part of the hotel not the newer tower.  The experience is not to be missed. (2) take a walk and eat in some of the restaurants in the neighborhood, not just at the hotel.  We ate at Trishna which is about a 10 minute walk and found it to be excellent. Also, the variety of pre-independence buildings in the area is quite interesting."
"I'd like to start by saying that I hope you like this review and think that if you have all the money in the world, and seriously don't even bat an eye at spending 10-20 times more for something than normal for the region, just go ahead and book this hotel, only if you stay in the palace wing on the Taj club level, and you won't be disappointed.  Now, on to the review.  For most hotels I stay in (and I've been to around 50 countries now) I'm very lenient, especially as the price gets lower and the hotel gets smaller... I prefer smaller boutique hotels.  When I get into 5-star properties, and I pay 5-star prices, my standards and expectations go up... waaaaaay up.  Keep in mind that one night at the Taj is equal to one years tuition, supplies, food, and housing for a student at"
Luzury to the core...they just pamper you. amazing food and best service.
We stayed for 2 nights Nov 12 & 13th 2011 in a luxury sea view suite.  WOW!!! From entering to leaving it was fantastic. We didn't want to leave. Cant wait to come back again.
"When I was working in Colaba with a PR outfit, we often has press conferences here and I was always in awe of the grandeur of this place! later a few years down the line, I had an opportunity for a short stay when we hosted an event for the Ambassador of Chile. The overall experience was wonderful! the rooms, banquets, the staff all are very impressive and all our events have always been a success when held at The TAJ."
"I stayed in one of the areas of the old wing that, thanks to having been less damaged in the 2008 terrorist attacks, was not renovated. Sadly, it shows. The wood panels in the room were well worn out, the mattress was tired and the ancient soundproofing made me feel part of the buzz of Mumbai.   Other than that, I am fully on board with my fellow reviewers regarding the impeccable level of service, the grand allure of the place and the colonial vibe. I sincerely hope that the hotel fully restores all the remaining rooms to their former glory."
We went there on Feb 2012..though we went there only for lunch the service  and food taste was excellent. Keep up your good services..
"We have stayed at various hotels around the world, but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of service and friendliness of staff at the Taj Mahal, Mumbai right from the minute you enter the hotel. The rooms are excellent. The ancient look with all the modern facilities and the staircase have been redone very well and give it a royal look. Food is very nice. Location is perfect – with the Gateway of India visible from the room windows."
"Its one of the most beautiful hotels I have seen. The location, the view from the room, the ancient look with all its modernity, the heritage wing and the staircase, its all very well done and maintained. The food is also very nice."
"I have stayed at many Hotels around the world but I was pleasently surprised with the outstanding customer care of Taj Mahal Palace Hotel from the time I entered the Hotel. Simply outstanding. Very efficient checkin process, excellent rooms- specially the bed and pillows- so comfortable and very clean. Very fast internet connection"
"nothing special but all the rooms are beautiful and very huge. also all the waiters wore friendly and helpful. Overlooking the Gateway of India with a panoramic view of the bay, every one of the 560 rooms  including 44 suites are the perfect blend of rich history and modern convenience. Today it is a Leading Hotel of the World and favourite destination for discerning business travellers."
"Stayed here for 3 nights in November in a club suite. Service was out of this world, breakfast was unbelievable amount of choice. Afternoon tea left us so stuffed, we were thoroughly spoilt for choice... the food in this hotel is simply beautiful!  Service around the pool was top notch, towels and water provided regularly - the swimming pool was lovely and big, good for swimming some lengths and getting exercise done.  Very impressed!  Staff were all very friendly, especially Vineet in Palace Services - who advised us on what to go and see and how to get around - great chap who will be a big loss to the hotel when he leaves for Cananda.  The restaurant Shamiana was a disappointment and not up to the same standard as the rest of the hotel though, so avoid going there.  The Jiva"
"We stayed here for 1 week at the end of our 2,5 month trip in India. Even though we had to spend quite a whole lot more than we would have normally done (backpacking india) we can say we enjoyed every single moment in this great place!   The best feature is probably the building itself and the perfect staff. Have never before seen such a professional level of service. The bed was so comfortable that we will try to get hold of the brand back home. Of course the location itself is priceless. The view from our room was the gateway of india, staying in mumbai it can not get any better than that.  The only remark we could have is that the food in the hotel is very expensive. But that said, it's the 5 star experience you pay for and that is certainly granted. If you're on a budget"
Stayed at the Taj for a week running a conference. The conference facilities were extremely professional and organised. The hotel boast some amazing restaurants and enjoys spectacular views of the Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea. Overall I would highly recommend the Taj as a great venue for a conference.
"A truly incredible experience. From the moment I began to make the booking the outstanding characteristic of our stay emerged, the unprecedented level of service. The staff of the Taj were incredible and their impeccable training was quickly evident. Everyone we dealt with was determined to ensure our stay was a wonderful experience . The room was lovely with beautiful decor and a great view over Mumbai. We stayed in the Towers and it went far beyond my expectation. The entire hotel is quite amazing with incredible art, wonderful restaurants and flawless service. Don't miss the heritage tour, for guests only, if you are at all interested in the history of the hotel. The stories were fascinating and presented in a delightful and engaging manner!"
"if you go to the Taj mahal hotel you experince the hospitality of india. the food is so good. i eat the dosa, black tea,etc. taj hotel is a vary beautiful hotel. it is a wonderful experience. than i go the India gate that is very near to the taj hotel, which is a very nice place. that place lots of tourist are come to see the India get and the wonderful experience of Indian hospitality."
I stayed here for a couple of days. I found the hotel to be very royal. It preserve the old culture of India. Its really a miracle in India as i was told by my friends before visiting. I have no appropriate words to explain about its beauty. I would like to stay again in this hotel.
"Nice Stay here and good ambience . The housekeeping is not upto the mark and needs inprovement . The rooms are awesome and is well maintained .Great hotel in so many ways. Good location, good sized rooms and fantastic service. We had to use the concierge on several occasions to ask for advice on shopping and tours and all the tips given worked out well."
"It took us two hours to get there from the airport due to a VIP celebrating their 25 years of service and all the streets being closed, such is India. We arrived late and due to the bombing in 2008 had to go into the hotel via the modern reception. Once they realised that we had booked into the old part of the hotel we were escorted to the correct and beautifully decorated reception area and coffee was served while we checked in. Our room was perfect and overlooked the Gateway to India. The hotel has been restored beautifully and, because of our late arrival, we were given a later check out the following day (till 16:00). The food was very good and the service also. No complaints."
i like about all the things of the hotel. Its really a miracle in India as i was told by my friends before visiting. I have no appropriate words to explain about its beauty. If you visit  i am sure you will feel like king Taj being your real palace.I heartedly thank Mr. Tata for taking such dreams to earth and specially in India
"I visited Mumbai in Monsoon staying at 2 hotels, one fruther out in the suburbs and the second the Taj Mahal Palace.   The hotel is situated on the water front (not to be mistaken, this is not the beach area) and has views over the Gateway of India. Due to the monsoon weather and heavy rains, the small boats that go to the Elephanta Caves were not in operation, but I believe out of monsoon you can catch a boat from here. The surrounding area can be explored safely, as I am a female and was travelling alone (for business). There are some extremely nice shops, Bombay Electric etc - the hotel concierge recommended and also provided a map. After walking round the streets next to the hotel I wandered up to the Causeway and wondered along the street. I did not find the shopping here"
"Luxury and Class redifined. Mumbai's best location for the best thing.. The TAJ. Its has its own charm. visit any hotel in India, TAJ is a must visit. Rooms are cozy and spacious. Beds are super comfortable. Variety of food is awesome. The view is the best of Mumbai.  Especially evenings."
"I stayed two nights in the club level, palace wing for around US$500/night.  My JNB-BOM flight arrived at 2 in the morning.  The Taj Palace almost botched the transfer (in reconfirming, they got the date wrong even though I emphasized it in my emails due to the early morning arrival time).  For the first time in the reconfirmation email, they told me I would need to pay another night to get into the room for the interim period after my arrival until check-in at 2 pm.    When I arrived, there was no mercy for this tired traveller.  Yes, I would have to pay another $500 to use the room for 10.5 hours until the 2 pm normal checkin, even though they wouldn't even need to service it etc.  When I balked, they told me I could wait (sleep) in the lobby.  This is a 5-star, best hotel in"
"Great hotel in so many ways. Good location, good sized rooms and fantastic service. We had to use the concierge on several occasions to ask for advice on shopping and tours and all the tips given worked out well. Room service was outstanding, particularly when my son was ill and the kitchen prepared him the locally accepted remedy for an upset stomach (which did seem to work!) There is a  nice pool area which made you feel further away from the traffic and crowds than you actually were. The pool area definitely needs more sun beds though as we often struggled to get one, particularly in the afternoon. My only real criticism of the hotel was the overpriced cost of having wi-fi in the bedroom (about £60 for a weeks stay) tho you could go to the business centre for a free 30minutes"
The hotel staff are extremely helpful and service oriented. I found the room costs and food costs to be expensive compared to other hotels of the same quality.
"Without repeating all the superlatives already written, there is really nothing to add. Absolutely, by far, the best!!!"
"The Taj is amazing, I have run out of words to describe how much we loved this place. The building is stunning and the Palace part is practically like walking in to Buckingham Palace, but even in one of the cheap rooms in the Tower, we had a stunning view of the Gateway of India and a lovely room. The service took my breath away. Absolutely everyone who works there was utterly charming and went so far above and beyond any expectations, even of a 5 star hotel. We were treated like royalty from beginning to end. It is a total oasis in the bustling city of Mumbai. The heritage tours of the hotel they do for new guests at 5pm are a must- totally fascintating. We can't wait to come back to the Taj."
"This has to be the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The service, food and professionalism of the staff was absolutely 10 star, never mind 5 star. The security at the hotel is excellent and made us feel safe."
"I had taken my daughter and parents to mumbai and Goa to celebrate my parents 50th marriage anniversary in a grand way (july 2011); something that we would cherish . The hotel was very nice and comfortable , We stayed in the palace wing and sea facing - very very nice service and rooms .The problem we faced was in the night . friday , saturday and sunday - night we couldnot sleep at all . there was this wedding going on in the 1st floor the music was so loud - beyond imagination- the bed was shaking and the sound was deafening all 3 nights . told the night manager to request that music be lowered , she apologised but - nothing else was done; it was some millionare's marriage - they didnot want to upset them ; we felt bad - we paid a huge sum for our rooms - not that it was free"
I've been to 60+ countries and stayed at a lot of nice hotels and I would put the Taj at the very top of my list.  Everything was perfect.  I had reserved a fairly inexpensive room/breakfast package in the Tower wing.  At check-in I was taken over to the Palace wing and upgraded to an upper floor Palace room with a view of the Gateway of India.  The room was PERFECT.  No other word for it.  It was obviously newly renovated.  Bathroom was amazing.  Service was great.  Bed and pillows were perfect.    I swear that every time I left the room even for a few minutes the room was straightened up.  When I was leaving Anil my housekeeper saw me starting to bring my suitcase out of the room and he insisted on taking it downstairs himself.  I will be highly tempted to splurge on the
"we've been 2 month in India, enjoying our tropical honey-moon... and the last two nights we spent at this spectacular hotel. although we looked like a real backpackers, we've got the finest service! we were completely amazed by the polite, warm and friendly stuff. what ever we asked for, we've got ""definitely sir"" as an answer.  the whole experience was heavenly unbelievable!!!"
"Stayed here for two nights on our cricket trip , Rooms were okay but the facilities are ace , and the staff are top class . Will definatly stay again .  Have stayed at both intercontinetals in Mumbai and the JW Marriot but the hotel experience here was by far the best . Made to feel so welcome and the staff could not do enough for you . Well done"
"First of all let me tell you that I travel a lot on business. Also am involved with the high end hospitality sector as a design professional. Am acquainted with business and design guidelines for 5 star hotels and resorts.  I stayed in this place in September 2011 for 1 night only. What makes this hotel tick is the location. Other than that I can comfortably rate this property at 4 stars the most. The daily rate should reflect this.   Savvy traveler who is not after the location only will be disappointed by the following: - Public corridors are dark, smelly and in need of urgent facelift - Guest rooms... Well, I stayed in one that had a great view of the historic gate and the Ocean beyond. However the room was in a bad need of refurbishment. Paint, furniture, curtains - it was"
"beautiful hotel, excellent service. Staff is very polite, dressed appropriately. Enjoyed high-tea!!!"
"Yes, i have mentioned this hotel as my home in mumbai. Excellent service from their staffs. I couldnt think of any other way to thank them than tipping generously in the end. Always theres a smile on every staffs face. And to make u feel secure, you need to go through through a few security checks to reach the lobby."
"What to say! It's superb.  The chaffeur team was excellent. Always smartly uniformed, calm driving and profesional. The welcome and check-in at the hotel was the best I have experienced. The room was beautifully appointed and all restaurants serve excellent food. Service is never more than a second away and perfectly judged. There is no feeling of pressure to tip for every interaction. High quality materials throughout. Find time to go to the spa."
My partner and I kicked off a two-week Indian vacation by staying at the Taj Mahal Palace.  A beautiful hotel and very kind staff.  Our room was nicely appointed and comfortable and in the main hotel.  The bathroom was completely done in marble and was stocked with the usual Taj soaps and shampoos.  The towels were thick and linens wonderful.  Room service was very good and the food came hot and ready to eat.  The service by the pool was amazing and we ate several meals in the pool area under the covered walkway - food was delcious.  Our only trip to the tower involved the a visit to the Moroccan restaurant at the top.  Food here was average and service a bit slow.  The public spaces of this property are beautiful. Highly recommended.
"The Taj Palace is the finest hotel that I have stayed in. It is a super luxurious hotel. The staff is very well trained and accommodating.  Located right next to the Gateway of India, most rooms offer an excellent view of the Arabian Sea. Colaba, Nariman Point and the Marine Drive are close by.  The original hotel (heritage wing) is very well maintained and gives you a regal feeling. The new tower is more modern but nonetheless very good.  The lounge, the restaurants, the pool everything is perfect!"
"Staying at the Taj - Heritage Wing is always a fantastic experience. From the vibe of the heritage building to the unique view of the Gateway of India to the attentive staff - it all comes together to enhance your experience. Some hotels have a buzz when you walk in and the Taj just has that certain something. Yet when you get into your room you are almost detached from the noisy cacophony that is Mumbai. A fantastic building, great poolside, fabulous restaurants and overall great energy. You can totally get spoiled with the highly attentive service. However, rooms are comfortable though not humongous and the extensive security checks (yes we know why) can be suffocating. Still a mus visit in this corner of the globe."
"Stayed here for one nght on a recent business trip.  From the moment you arrive to the point of departure, there is nothing too much for the excellent staff.  We ate at the International restaurant, ie where the breakfast is served, where the attentiveness of the staff extended to the point where they would pretty much 'design' a meal to your particular specification.  Check-in was smooth with accompanying garland of flowers and welcoming 'committee', then led to the room all inside 5 minutes.  In the evening, we were invited into the Heritage Lounge for Tea/Coffeee, surely one of the most maginificent and tranquil locations in the enire city.  A real & fortunate treat for which we were not charged. When they came to top-up the tea, we were asked if we wanted fresh cups/saucers."
"Amazing experience. the Heritage, the history and the location including the power to withstand a major terrorist attack...all these fill your emotions and when you enjoy the trust and comfort in every transaction, you feel wow!!"
"This is one of the most beautiful Hotels. You could not want for anything. The staff are friendly, the rooms are luxurious and Immaculate. Laundry services are available. I recommend paying the extra to stay in the Palace section of the hotel, as opposed to the towers, because it is beautiful. Ask for a room on one of the higher floors facing the Gateway to India. Many wealthy people have their weddings in this hotel, so make friends with them and get invited! Great fun! In India, one thing you cannot scrip on is hotels and food. It feels overcrowded and people are constantly harassing you! So as you walk into the hotel it is like a calm luxurious sanctuary in a dirty city. Behind the hotel there are markets and tailors etc. I recommend a Halaal restaurant around the back street"
"For anyone like me who thought the old Taj Mahal Palace is just another Hotel, he maybe under wrong impression. The care taken for the guest is just out of the world, be it upgrades, making an occassion most special or a chance to visit the Presidential Suite. It's truly The Taj..."
"The hotel is amazing, location is good and the service is incredible. But the rooms in the palace are old and not very nice (except for an excellent bad)."
"The best hotel I ever been! really fantastic! next to the gate of Mumbay, for a nice walk by the sea! Fantastic restaurants and boutiques inside the hotel, a marvellous swimming pool, bars... The wing palace is the best place to stay: a 7 stars service!!!"
"This hotel has it all. Always ask for the older hotel - the new tower is alright but the older building is where it is at. The history, the ambiance, the detail - it is simply spectacular. Amazing food - in every restaurant - and South Indian dancing in one! The staff was very helpful. The pool was cool but the massages afterwards were hot!! The rooftop hotel is worth a visit and would suggest the rooms overlooking the gateway. We saw a few Bollywood celebrities at a gala event and were invited for drinks on the terrace. Definitely a must stay when visiting Mumbai."
"The Taj Palace has everything - brilliant location and views,  incredibly hospitable staff, beautiful pool and gardens, luxuriously appointed rooms, top spa and beauty salon, an abundance of world class restaurants, excellent security, numerous retail outlets  and even a guided history and art tour!  It's certainly worthwhile staying in the Palace (old wing) as it gives you access to the palace lounge which serves complimentary  afternoon tea, cocktails and after dinner cognac and chocolates.  One is made to feel very special here and the staff seem very appreciative that their guests have chosen to stay despite the horrific attacks of 26/11/08."
"If you ever think of the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, hospitality is the first word that should come to your mind. The staff there will ensure that you feel special, with every move of their's made with the intention of providing you pleasure and comfort.   My room was located in the Tower wing. It was a spacious room, with the balcony giving a wonderful view of the streets below (not the see though). The mattress was extremely soft and comfortable and a dream to sleep on. The study table in the room was comfortable too for working on my laptops. A couple of issues were there with the room though. There was only one electric socket which could be used for charging, so I could only charge my laptop or my mobile at one point of time. This was often very irritating. Also, they did not"
"This hotel, it's staff, facilities and restaurants are magnificent. If in Mumbai this is a must. Style and sophistication ooze. From checkin, to the pool, security and rooms this is Indian hospitality at it's best.  I have stayed in many amazing places around the world...I still rate the Taj as the best hotel I've stayed in."
"I usually prefer this hotel when I come to Mumbai for business purposes. I enjoyed a great experience of staying in this hotel during business meetings.  The location is beautiful. The services from the hotel staff is excellent to take care of the guests especially a grand welcome to the guest.  The food is very good and the rooms are very neat & clean, more specifically, meeting rooms are very spacious. Its really excellent, very pleasant and more enjoyable to stay. Its awesome...."
"Will never stay at a Taj property again because of complete lack of respect to human decency.  We stayed on Christmas eve and day 2010.  The day we checked out the front page of the main newspaper had the story ""Five star South Mumbai hotel target of al-quada terrorists"" with a picture of the Taj Palace.  We had no warnings from the hotel, no escorts, no extra security (non-existent for the pool area), the elevators do not have level controls with the card.  Worst part: when I asked the concierge the night before if it were safe to walk around the area, they said of course, no problem.  Only in hindsight did we connect the dots on the armoured police cars in the area.  A letter to the hotel later garnered no response.  So if you respect your life, pass on this hotel. Many have"
I had a very good experience of staying in this hotel during a business conference. It is located in a central location...Has got good staff to take care of the guests very well. The food is great and the rooms are very clean and neat. The conference rooms are spacious enough to hold a big conference. It is a really good hotel. Would recommend to every body visiting Mumbai...
"My wife and I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai during our recent two week trip to India for one night when passing through the city.  I have stayed at all types of hotels literally all over the world and I have to say that this property is the most outstanding I have ever had the pleasure of staying at.  Every aspect of the Taj is spot on.  The beautiful location just opposite the striking Gateway to India is the best in the City.  The building itself is majestic and posses a genuine old world charm that many try to emulate unsuccessfully.  The service exceeds all reasonable expectations.  The ambiance is clean and classy, without overdoing it.  While I did not dine at the hotel, I thought the dining options were plentiful and I've heard the quality is as one good as"
"I have spent one night at the Taj Palace in Mumbai during my business trip in India. I experienced most friendly and helpfull people. The room was also very pleasant, will all necessary facilities.The food was excellent. I would return next time."
The Taj Mahal is an experience and not just a hotel stay. Mostly because of its employees who work in all the departments of the hotel.  My wife and I were celeberating our 2nd wedding anniversary and we were treated as royalty....
"I visited for a conference in Sept 6 to Sept 8. The checkin process was fastest in the industry. They greet you with Aarti, Tilak and Garland (which I politely refused) but others were loving it. The rooms were decent. The staff were local people (few were elderly) and did not seem like ""polished"" from some Catering College in Goa or some far place. Can you imagine discussing wines grown in Nasik (Sula etc) with Stewards/Bar tenders with names More, Jadhav in chaste Marathi in 5 Star Hotels. Another staff member actually helped with local neighborhood snack shops and tips about taxis. Reality is I know  about the neighborhood having spend 40 years of my life all in Mumbai. however appreciated the help (another first -- 5star staff advising guests about outside street food on"
"I was ""Taj-ing"" my way through various parts of India, my second trip, and stayed at many lovely properties, but the Mumbai Taj Palace was special. The service was excellent and so attentive. I had arrived from Khujaraho, via Goa, and not feeling quite up to par from airport to the Taj.  Well, they knew before I arrived, and greeted me so warmly. Sent a lovely young female ""concierge' to look after my every need.  I used spa facilities; they had a great book store, and was invited to breakfast by the former deputy general manager of Palace, who is now GM at another of their locations. THe lobby is beautiful and sophisticated and routes the traffic well. The business center was helpful and everything was beyond expectations. I had asked for and got a room overlooking ""India Gate"""
"We came in at nearly midnight and what a sight it was for us. The structure itself is quite amazing and beautiful and gives one the feeling of a genteel life in colonial times. Our room was one of the best we've been in, one of the best combinations of heritage structure with modern amenities and conveniences. The most amazing part though was the service, our on demand butler who was exceedingly gracious to the simple wait staff in the coffee shop, you get the sense of great pride and purpose in their vocation! Not the cheapest place to stay in Mumbai but very well worth it!"
"We stayed here to end an extended tour of India.  It's not best Taj or Hotel I have ever stayed in but it would certainly make the top 5.  Getting into the hotel is a chore with all the security, it feel like you're back at the airport but given the events of the past, you can't blame them.  Once at reception they are very welcoming, efficient and friendly, the quality and standards of the hotel are clearly apparent.  Our room (ocean view) was very comfortable and as expected from a hotel of this class.  We found the room very quiet given the buzz of the city just outside.  The hotel is a beacon of tranquillity and calmness, it's almost like stepping into a parallel universe.  It's a great place to stay, be seen and see others.  Everything you could need is available to you"
Super place is what I can say!!!  and a must vist for any body in Mumbai.
"You hear a lot about the Taj Palace before staying there, but nothing really prepares you for the feeling you get of luxury around the hotel. The staff can't do enough to help you and the hotel is exquisitely furnished and modern.   We stayed in the Tower which was brilliant, but not as good as the Palace we were told. Our room overlooked the Gateway of India and we could sit and watch the ferries/boats come in every day. We treated ourselves to room service which was amazing. We decided to have breakfast by the beautfiul pool area and the Taj can be the only hotel in the world where you choose your food from a buffet and have your plate taken from you and delivered by a waiter!   The security is tight, so you can't take photos of the lobby and get frowned at if you do around"
I was a long term guest at the Taj and I never experienced such an excellent service until staying there... All staff became like my own family and I always felt warmly welcomed by all. Mr Tata must be proud of such excellence.... I will always come back to Taj whenever I go back to Mumbai...   
"Being back packers, we like to end our travels with a splurge. The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai is perfect for it. Clothed in slacks, carrying backpacks and shoes all muddied from the trod in the city, we must've looked odd beside the bentleys parked at the front.   the guard eyed us as we entered the lobby, the staff still managed to pull a smile and welcomed us anyways.   note to self: must dress up to fit in here!   no doubt it's beautiful, the heritage and the grandiouse decor, the ever ready staff to make your stay any better than it already is the moment you check in. makes you feel like princes and princesses.  Excellent stay. But brings you right down to earth the moment you step out."
"This is the quintessential experience in Indian hospitality and service--the very best of the best.  Make sure you splurge for a palace room.  The tower seems to be just another hotel experience, but the palace is a ticket to another time and place.  A palace room (in addition to being beautiful, historic, and full of character) entitles you to hours in the warm and welcoming Palace Lounge--including high tea, cocktails, and attention to all your whims--and a plethora of upgrades and amenities.  Gracious and courteous, the staff is what makes the luxurious Taj Mahal Palace Hotel so magical.  They attend to every detail.  They know exactly who each guest is and what he/she needs.  They remember you and inquire about your experiences from the day before.  It's Service at the"
"I started off my India vacation at the Taj Mahal Palace thinking that it would be a good way to ease into a completely different culture.  I was traveling by myself and would be flying down to South India in a few days.  I had only vague recollection of the 2008 terrorist attack that occurred there (perhaps would not have gone there if I had remembered!!) The place is beautiful and a real treat.  The concierges are very helpful in arranging whatever you need, and found a tour guide (they are free lance) for me on very short notice.  I was particularly impressed by Viren D'Sa, a very personable young man, ""front office executive"",  who gave a late afternoon tour of the hotel on my first day, with many stories about the history of the hotel, owners, along with recollections of the"
Lovely hotel. Fantastic service. The pool area is great. Lots of food choices too. 
This is one heritage hotel I would suggest one should experience in their lifetime!!  Royal Rooms and lining with an option to open the window which is rarely possible in most luxury hotels and gaze at the spectacular view of Gate Way of India and the horizons of the  Arabian sea. Ideal for leisure travelers. For business trips stay here if your clients or meetings are in south Mumbai.
"From the moment you enter this hotel, you feel as if the hotel staff already knows you as if you have been to the hotel multiple times before. And this is true for the front office, the bell desk, the events desk and so on. So my room was waiting for me at the hotel and I was upgraded to a palace wing room from the tower wing room. The palace rooms are very tastefully decorated and you relive the early times when these rooms were used by the maharajas of India. The sea views from the small balcony area in the room are spectacular. The interactive television has movies on demand and internet connectivity. The hotel has heritage and art tours on which guests are told about the history of the hotel and are shown the rich collections of art which the hotel has procured over years."
The visit to the Taj Mahal Palace was truly a brilliant one.  Excellent front office staff.  Excellent security and just wondering what went wrong when it was rampaged!!!  The Sea in front of the Hotel is truly inviting and be sure to try and take a ride on the speed boat if you manage to find one
"Was there for 1 nite on a business visit.  getting into the hotel was a nitemare.  there was so much security and barricades and the entrance is rather small compared to what it was pre 26/11 days.  however, the security is understandable coz the zaveri bazzar mumbai blasts had happened just a cpl of weeks ago.  however, once u enter the hotel, the grandeur takes over.  the lobby, people....chandeliers...etc etc.  the room i got was a sea facing room on the 5th fl;oor with a direct view of the gateway of india which was easily the highlight of the stay for me.  a balcony overlooking the gateway of india and the seas beyond and the mumbai lights.  fascinating.  room....very well maintained. neat and clean. conventional, but well maintained.  bathrooms could use some refurbishing"
"The Taj Palace is truly fantastic, the service superb, the food terrific.  Mumbai is a difficult city, but being in the Taj made our trip enjoyable. The old wing is particularly fine.  On two stays we were upgraded to a room there without having to ask for it."
"After reading a number of bad reviews, I was worried about staying here.  We booked rooms in the Tower and our expectations were low but they were lovely.  We had a view right over the Bombay Gate and the water.  The rooms have obviously been refurbished and they were a reasonable size.  The bed was large and very comfy and there was a lot of attention to detail and nice staff.  The bathroom was old fashioned style but not in a shabby way - more in keeping with the hotel and it still had a good shower etc. The overall hotel is beautiful - the gardens at the back of the hotel, the original building and the large pool all have a lovely colonial ambience.  The only criticism is the food is expensive.  I would definitely go back."
"Check out the restaurants, although on the steep side .... they are quite good. The service was fantastic. The hotel was a little damp which may have been because of the July monsoon."
"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our first anniversary.  The hotel staff was very courteous and had arranged for a delicious cake to celebrate our anniversary.  They were very prompt with any request, be it room service or enquiries about the facilities offered.  The service was impeccable.  This was clearly demonstrated at the buffet breakfast.  We were one of the few guests at the buffet at the time when the buffet was about to close.  However, we were offered all the food options at the buffet.  In fact, the staff arranged for freshly baked croissants (which were divine) for us despite the late hour.  Great service.  Our room too was a great experience, with an extremely comfortable bed and a lovely view of the Arabian sea.  To sum up, this may just become our annual"
"I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Mumbai. We stayed at the Taj as it is the iconic Mumbai hotel. What a disappointment! Our room  had been freshly renovated in a very tasteful way and the bathroom was nice. However, the room had a small window that could not be opened which made the room feel claustrophobic. The legendary Taj service was nice but I think that the lobby and the restaurants felt dated. Overall, this hotel needs something to make it feel special again."
one of the more expensive ones but totally worht the money. the rooms are comfortable and the staff very helpful. this hotel is an icon of the city and a must visit even if not staying there for the varity of the international cuisine served at the restaurants.
I have stayed at this hotel before and after the attacks and the service has been impeccable both times. I thought the hotel was beautiful before but they have enhanced it even more after the renovations and the security made me feel safe which was ideal.  The staff are friendly and attentive and the location is ideal to exploring Mumbai. I look forward to staying there again.
"Well located, sea view, tourist attraction. This hotel became even more known after 26/11 attack. Staff is extremely hospitable, good resturants and shopping. Hotel has a very good collection of art, abmience extremely pleasent. Hotel belongs to tata group who are well know for their CSR work."
"When you are at the palace sea view side, you will be awaken with noisy black crows & some other birds...  its very noisy especially in the morning.   At night, expect a noise also from gateway of India from the crowds...especially when there's a wedding...you can hear them chanting and shouting  and it will last long... my experience was I am awake until 3AM because of this noise... The window is not sound proof....  Most importantly, watch out for the pre-authorized amount on your credit card.  It will not be cancelled unless you dont call them and the WORST thing, you will need to wait for 15 days before it will be credited back to your account as they are not using a machine to unblock this amount.  The staff on this department is VERY VERY VERY INEFFICIENT AND NOT VERY"
"Amazing. My second trip here and the spectacular setting opposite the Gateway of India is awesome. The Hotel is an imperial oasis from everything around you, has every in  room amenity you could wish, classic Indian service and the opportunity to dine from menus around the world.  The cost though has escalated since the last time I visited a few years ago but it is well worth saving up for."
"This June I was booked at the Taj Palace Hotels, South Mumbai. For people, not having the patience to read through, let's say that the experience was ""fantastic"". I was put up at one of the Deluxe Rooms, which was equipped with everything that you can think of, or probably use during the stay, right from a complementary welcome wine bottle to a hair dryer and a sewing kit. I had stayed for two days, and I would readily recommend the place to visitors as well as prefer it myself if I have to put up at hotels in Mumbai. The treatment and hospitality that I had received was simply amazing and does not leave any room for complaint or even dissatisfaction. I was staying in a sea facing room and the view was panoramic to say the least. The food was exceptional and you have the option"
"It was the last hotel we stayed, arriving on day after another terrorist bombing in Mumbai... The cabs have to stop out in the street, as a security measure. Check in was uneventful, the first room we were taken to was really awful, smelly and moldy carpet, great for my allergies, overlooking the roof and if you extended your neck out in the window, you could maybe see the pool. You could still hear the screaming children at the pool.... For us$700/night, palace renovated taj club room we expected more. After expressing our total disappointment with the room, we were transferrd to another room. It made all the difference. New room was with hard wood floors, a great view of bay and Gate of India, no funky smell...   Service was great... Despite lots of security, they were"
"The hotel has been restored to its former glory. The Palace rooms are amazing, as is the service, which is like no where else!  Nothing is too much trouble.  Great room service, restaurants, spa, swimming pool, hair and beauty salon.  Great place to start and end holidays in India.  Only problem is the very high security now, which has ruined the feel of entering and leaving the hotel, but fully understandable."
"I stayed at the Taj for two nights for business in July. The security has obviously been beefed up. I saw a guard on my floor every time I was getting on the elevator.  The reception area has been beautifully restored. Air conditioning was a tad over bearing at breakfast, but dinner outside by the pool was perfect. Wifi was good throughout hotel, and bed was comfortable.  The hotel felt very empty though. It seemed there were not many guests, which is a shame."
"If you want to conduct business, experience Indian hospitality,  fine tastes and become a part of history, this is a grandest place to get to. I was fortunate to get the old wing which represents that grand symbol of Indian defiance to all things imposed...  A guided tour around would have well been worth it ( Didnt have the time). Some of the grand halls and meeting rooms have antique wooden doors, the food is high quality and service is complete.  Try to get a room that faces the sea to wake up looking at the yachts and motorboats floating just across. You wake up to the birds and can go for a nice long stroll by the sea side where almost everything you see is history.  K. Vikram"
"All staff at Taj were, as usual, WONDERFULLY COURTEOUS! Vinayak at Palace reception was specially excellent in remembering my last visit's detail (some long time back) and it was reelly great of the Duty Manager, Mr. Vinay Govande to come & greet us  !!   Since we were upgraded to the Palace Wing, stay was even more brilliant. You could stay at any of the regular 5 star hotels, but you can't get to stay at something like the Taj Mahal Palace (heritage wing) in the heart of city as Mumbai !  Palace butlers were also fantastic in their services. Palace rooms are real heritage, but also, at the same time, are equally modern with all the amenities & infrastructure including touch-panel electric switches, cordless phones, wi-fi, LED TV, mini-bar, coffee-press, kettle, etc. etc. and"
"My wife and I had promised to spend a weekend at Taj Palace once it reopened post the 2008 attacks.  We were blown away by how beautiful the hotel is and aesthetically the rooms have been done up. Only the Taj can convert an adversity into an opportunity and redo the entire hotel so beautifully. The rooms are large and the bathrooms are fabulous. Rich textures and furnishings make the look and feel like a palace.  In the heart of Mumbai city the hotel is an oasis of calm and tranquility. Palace wing guests can avail of the Palace lounge for complimentary tea/coffee, high tea and evening soft drinks and snacks.  The pool is large and fabulous.  Also do take the heritage walk to see the suites and rooms in the hotel every evening at 5 pm. Well worth it.  Truly the flagship hotel"
"Beautiful old world grandeur.  This is like going back in time.  Amazing welcome at the airport in an air-conditioned Mercedes (did cost extra) with cold water and flannels and maps of Mumbai to look at during the 30 minute journey from the Airport.  Met at the door of the hotel by a lovely man who gave us details of the amenities and showed us to our room which they had very kindly upgraded due to our 'special' holiday status.  The room was beautiful, very well furnished, but by far the best thing was the view of the bay and the incredible gateway to India.  This made our stay as we were able to take photo's from our window of the monument at different times of the day and it looked fabulous!  We spent the day wandering around bustling Mumbai, there's plenty to see close by to"
"This was the 4th visit to MUMBAI and i loved this ones.  The Taj really has an aura about it, the building is beautiful and the location great, right in the heart of Colaba. The security is very reassuring and it has definitely been stepped up since the attacks. My only real gripe was with the standard of accommodation. The first twin room we were shown was quite honestly abysmal. It was tiny, old and very run down. After I complained they moved us to another twin room which was definitely better than the original room I had been shown, but still not what you would expect from a 5 star establishment like the Taj. The room was of good size, but was lacking of any real quality. No LCD TV, poor quality bath towels, and a bit worn. The room would not have looked out of place in a 3"
"I loved the taj. Everything was perfect. The staff wonderful, room GEORGOUS, hotel just divine in every way. The service really sets this place apart. Take the hotel tour with Viren, the history is really incredible. Everyone is proud to work at the Taj and you feel that as soon as you walk in. You MUST stay at the taj if youbare going to Mumbai."

"Taj Mahal Palace is trully an extraordinary hotel with fantastic service!  It made me feel like princess Scheherazade staying in there.) Don't miss on the introductory excursion about the history of Taj Palace that takes place every day at 5pm (free of charge). Also worth mentioning is a great quality of beds and pillows - for extra demanding people like me, order the feather bed and various high-quality pillows (free of charge), and enjoy the royal sleep!"
"Even though I did not enjoy Mumbai at all, this hotel is simply fantastic. However, don't have dinner at their so called indian resturant, because it is super expensive and not indian at all. I've had mote authentic indian food in Sweden, which says a lot.   But the rooms are large, and the hotel in itself is a sight to behold, also the service is great. If it wasn't for the unsatisfying resturants I would have stayed within The Taj's walls until I left Mumbai."
"Have finally come back to Taj, after the 26/11. While the Towers rooms still offer the Taj Experience ... in a way, the Palace rooms are just among the best experience you can have. You are in town, which already has its amazing charme, you are at the Taj, in front of India Gate, another unique psyco experience, you have the best old India atmosphere (architecturally it is ""depaysant""), and rooms have been refurbished in the best way, both for the interior design and for the cutting edge technology and a lot of gadgets."
It is the best hotel in town .... It is extremely beautiful and is royal .... It definitely is a place to be to ! Situated in front of the main landmarks of mumbai i.e The gateway of India . Gives a beautiful view to the arabian sea .
The Best Hotel in Hospatality Deserve to be an Outstanding rating no doubt Excellent in understanding the customers need  Suggestion Being a Member I would look forward for Complementary Internet when I visit on Business Purpose
"The best hotel in Mumbai. Its been completely renovated since the fateful terror attacks and back to its former glory.  We stayed int he palace wing and the views, the service, the room and the food was absolutely astounding. Do try the zodiac grill for a fine dine experience and souk on the top floor for some stunning views. Great place to stay."
"Wonderful experience at taj, room facing the sea and you can see people enjoying the Gate way of India, ships and boats floating around, while enjoying famous chokolets and cookies of Taj! After sad 911, it has been remade and looks far better than even earlier. Lobby is beautiful, stairs are more beautiful than lifts! Excellent decor in rooms, ultra fine facilities and grand documentary on TV channel"
"This was the last stop of our honeymoon and we couldn't have ended it in a better way.  The hotel upgraded us to the palace for free, the room was incredible (awesome shower, hybrid plugs, super fast internet, most comfortable bed ever) and the staff were incredibly attentive.  Each time we'd leave we would come back to some sort of honeymoon gift which was just a lovely touch.  We felt completely comfortable and at home here, and missed it terribly when we left.  It was a shock to come home and realize that we don't have a butler in real life!"
"Wha Taj! Fantastic service, right from check in to check out and everything in between. Check in was flawless and personal, service at breakfast was impeccable and room service/ housekeeping was par excellence."
"aaaahhh...Taj! Fantastic service, right from check in to check out and everything in between. Check in was flawless and personal, service at breakfast was impeccable and room service/ housekeeping was par excellence. Indian hospitality at its supreme best!"
Anything I write cannot be enough. Visit it to discover what hospitality rather being a guest of the place means. We enjoyed every moment of our stay. I am a Bombay-ite and recommend the experience to every person...tourist or city dweller! Taj Palace is another world...most brilliant piece of architecture in the city
"It is the perceptive and friendly service that makes it worthwhile staying in this small  hotel. The staff are social at just the right level and they go to great length to make you feel at home. This said, there is nothing wrong with the facilities. The room we had was spacious and pretty, the breakfast is good."
TAJ Mahal hotel offers excellent ambiance and comfortable stay . This is one of the best hotels The facilities provided are good enough to create a lifetime memories. The location and the service will be cherished by me for lifetime.
"It was marvelous & perfect what else I can say about this beautiful property, Visit India visit TAJ HOTELS it is one of the bestest experience you have ever get in your life…  It is near Gateway of India, where you find ferries for your ocean adventure and a beautiful view you can see through TAJ HOTEL rooms. This is the heritage place to visit in Mumbai… This was a good experience and I would definitely prefer to visit once again."
Mumbai: The Taj Mahal Palace Date: 6th december We booked this hotel for our family stay  and it was a very wonderful stay with exceptionally corteous staff.  The charm of the old wing works on your senses and hats off to the management for restoring it so fast. Commnendable work and the efficient and quality service makes it one of the best in the world.
"The Taj Palace is as elegant as you'd expect, with a great assortment of restaurants.  The sushi restaurant was especially good.  The hotel is well-located, and you can walk out for shopping or more dining options.  My only complaint was the pigeons on my window sill.  They were noisy during the day--but slept when I did."
"This is a great hotel. The location is perfect for leisure travellers; close to all of the sights in southern Mumbai and well placed for shopping and good local restaurants.  We stayed in a palace room for 3 days in April on an advance purchase rate which included breakfast - still quite expensive. However, the breakfast is very good, if you can manage to get back to your table without sometime taking your plate for you!  The pool is excellent and the pool staff are very helpful without being ott. The gym is well equipped with a good selection of aerobic machines, free weights and a separate area for stretching.  We didn't dine in the hotel restaurants because the local restaurants are very good and much better value (Indigo, Trishna and Lings).  Now to the sometimes impersonal"
"As I said ""No words to explain the hospitality"" , Taj Mahal, Mumbai is a great hotel and really a jewel. Although was not able to stay in the old wing but still the hotel has a different aura around it. Being a foodie myself, I tried almost all the restaurants and rate Wasabi highest although it is bit overly priced but eating at Taj Mahal, Mumbai is altogether a different experience. Rooms are great so do service."
"nothing to add to the other reviews .  this is the best hotel i ever stayed in , and i have one myself  :) . service perfect , rooms fantastic , all more than better .  maybe one sugestion , we stayed for 4 nights and tried one of the restaurants at the hotel .  Nice but not wauw , go in colaba or a litlle further , taxis are cheap, and eat fantastic for a fraction of the price in the hotel , and better .  sorry guys but it is a fact.  alcohol is expensive everywhere in india , but at the taj it is the price of a glass for the price of a bottle elswhere .  to expensive .  but go , go to india , go to mumbai , yes it is crowdy , but go, it is fantastic . and at the palace , old wing , you will feel at home or better ."
"After a couple of days at the Taj Lands Ending Hotel (see my review), we moved down to the Taj Palace, staying 2 nights in one of the Palace Wing heritage rooms. the elegance, atmosphere and superb service were everything one could hope for. i've seen a few cryptic comments about the rooms and quality of furnishings. my view is that they are very ample in size, not huge, but with a rather large bathroom, sitting area etc. the bathrooms are especially luxurious with huge bathtub and separate shower stall with rain forest shower head. lavish use of marble and stone abound. i would term the room furniture to be solid, english style, understated luxury. the butlers and separate reception area staff  can't do enough for you. there is a special library lounge where Palace Room guests"
"Well, its good to be back at the Taj after the renovation. The old wing has been done up beautifully, and enough has been written about it.  Room on the 5th floor with a window overlooking the sea...While the rooms are great, thats not what this hotel is known for - all around, with the artefacts, art pieces carefully selected, the elevator with the analog sign, all go a long way to make this a unique experience  Food continues to be great and had a lovely meal at the Souk overlooking Mumbai city on one side and the harbour on the other side.  Ahh, one little hitch - there is no valet parking!!! I know that they have not allowed this post opening, but there is a very discreet sign that says ""Valet Parking is temporarily unavailable"" very subtle, but then all guests kind of"
"i had a good  time in this hotel feel very relaxed after my work finished i take a steam bath then a cold shower , nice facility with nice service ,,,,,,,,when i open the windows the sound of the sea water  in my room  fresh up me every time  nice and beautiful place for stay...... as the hotel is the beauty of the city and when its seem from outside  the majestic feeling generate in my heart"
"Having stayed at one of the other Taj properties on my last trip to India, I decided to try the Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai - I was not disappointed.  The rooms are meticulously appointed with attention to any need you might have.  The service is gracious without being intrusive.  The property is lovely - since I was on business I spent a fair amount of time in the hotel working and didn't feel any need to leave!  I did try the spa which was great (and great value compared to American spas).  The location is good for either business or leisure.  Would definitely stay again."
"There is a certain nostalgia, charm and sense of history, each time you drive in to the hotel or see its iconic structure. The two things about Taj Mahal that are almost in your face when you come into the hotel are the very bustling lobby (some days it may actually feel like a bazaar) and the very effusive style service that seems so eighties/ nineties (in a nice, warm way).   Rooms are comfortable in size with enough free space to move around. Some of the ornate detailing in interiors (rooms, corridors) really goes with its overall aura.  We stayed long as we were doing a really long convention. The service from hotel staff in front office, banqueting, food and beverage is fantastic. The front office staff including concierge were super helpful and friendly - you wont feel"
"From the first 30sec. you will understand why it's ranked #1 Hotel in Mumbai ...  Stayed at the Taj 2 nights last week and I really enjoyed it ...The location is perfect, the facilities (even if I didn’t have time to experience all of them) were great, the service is top-notch, the food is delicious & you have a very rich choice …Everything was G R E A T!  Special thanks to the lovely lady at the reception (I forgot her name!) who escorted us to our room and made the check-in (we arrived at 4am!)…So accommodating and so friendly …  This is THE hotel to choose when in Mumbai …Don’t look any further! Prices are very reasonable  2 regrets: I didn’t make sure to book the newly refurbished rooms at the Tower (1st to 3rd Floor) …My stay was extremely short!"
"I have stayed in hotels all over the world, some large, some small and this is certainly one of the best.  Exceptional service from the moment we arrived at the front gate.  Security is very tight, as you would expect following what happened 2 years ago, but rather than finding this tedious, it makes me feel very safe.  We were upgraded to the palace and the rooms were spacious and luxurious with no small detail missing.  Examples include the cable set allowing you to connect your Ipod, laptop or ipad to the tv sound system.  Buttons next to the bed to indicate ""do not disturb"" etc. were also a nice touch.  The hotel has a shopping arcade downstairs and other great features including a barber in the salon (£8 for haircut) and spa.  The spa may seem over the top at first but is"
They refuse to allow me to bring my indian boyfriend in the room simply because we were two men. They dispute with us  in front of many other people stating that these were the rules of the hotel (not possible to register a second person once the first one was already registered) and blocking my boyfriend with security's staff to enter the elevator and going to my room: it embarrass. In a 5 star hotel where you pay more than 400 euro per night this is not not only not acceptable but is an attitude against the rights of a person and the possibility to choose to whom to sleep in bed. They should change their rules i suggest...
"The Taj Mahal Palace is the first landmark in Indian hospitality and the symbol of pride for redoubtable India. To say it is world class is an understatement. It's in a class of its own!  Besides the numerous credits that the hotel has, the resilience is remarkable and the genuine warmth of the staff is unmatched. Since the hotel needs no introduction, writing about it is more an honour for us than for the property itself"
The hotel is one of the most grand ive ever been to....beautiful interirors and extremely polite and courteous staff..extremely well kept rooms and a variety of restaurants  to choose from..the location is also really central and theres lots to do around the hotel...really good place to stay if u have the budget !!!!surely gonna stay here next time...MUMBAI Rocks !!
"Revisited this Mumbai icon after a gap of a year during which the refurbished Palace Wing got reopened. Unfortunately the security measures undertaken by the hotel management is very disturbing and comes heavily on the way of free flow of traffic in and out of the hotel. For example a guest has to get out of his or her car outside the hotel premises in the middle of the road. Similarly, while getting out, he or she would have to call the driver on mobile phone and wait in the middle of the road for the driver to reach the hotel to pick the guest up. I found it extremely painful. It appears the hotel is now meant only for bigtime celebs or VVIPs or those who are interested in visiting a historic place. By the way, hotel staff was quite efficient and friendly in most of the"
"In a city like Mumbai, one is never at a loss for choices when it comes to choosing a good place to stay the weekend. It is therefore no easy task for a hotel to stand out amongst some of the best and largest brands in the industry. Nonetheless it is this very reputation that makes the Taj stand out as superlative. Steeped in history, both recent and otherwise, this hotel is an  attraction in itself given its location in Colaba, the tourist hotspot of Mumbai.   However compared to the other Taj locations (Mansingh in Delhi or Taj Bengal in Kolkata) the property offers little past its grand facade. While the service is excellent, the warmth of the other Taj properties is conspicuously absent. The rooms are small and the amenities basic (Televisions in our rooms were small 14 inch"
"this hotel is located in the business hub city of india.this hotel is maintained by tata group.as its name suggests,its grandeur is famous over world wide.its lobby,its swimming pool means everything is in full bloom.anyone wants to have fine dinning experience can walk into this hotel."
Its was my dream to stay in Taj mumbai and what i was expecting is what i recd. I will be back soon. Its was not a stay it was a experience. The hotel after the renovation has not only become better but one of the top 3 hotels worldwide and i guess anyone would say that who have stayed in the old wing of Taj Mahal Mumbai
"Food  at Golden Dragon was really  a  lifetime experience, Dining at  this   restaurant inside  Taj , you  shall   for  sure  remember  the food  experience. The rooms   are  very   well   done   after  the 26/11   incidents. Only  demerit   being  the  excessive security  and vigilance, makes you feel ,  there could be  a little  bit  more   of  privcy"
"Best hotel to stay in, the people, food, and service is great. You get the value for money. It is facing the sea front and the night vision is so great, other than that the Gateway of India looks great from the hotel. I wish i can stay for ever and forget the tension of this world. I could say in few words ----- If you wanted to be in Heaven then be in Taj"
"We stayed some days in a sea viem room, small room and small bath room as you have in these old hotels, but with a wonderful view. Very good receiving at reception, many gratis things as free mini bar and happy hour drinks. More than 7 restaurants and all food with garlic. We cannot stand garlic and there was no possibility to get something without. Old and oxidated wines from the new world but also from Europe, but a risk to pay so much money for, because if bottle is open you cannot explain to server that the wine has gone and colour is browe and not drinkable because indian waiters no drink wines.  But it was really an experience to be in that hotel and we thank everybody there!"
This place is indeed the best one could perhaps expect to stay and it is difficult to imagine how it could have been rebuilt so well and fast considering the tragedy that struck it not long back. Tata's love to make a mark is evident in every nook and corner of the place. And the staff's service is indeed fabulous! A place one should be if at all only for a day!
I liked the location. The view from my room was good as well as the its in the heart of the town location is just perfect. This place is worth the money. Their restaurant's also good. If you go there don't miss an opportunity have a nice dinner there.
"Date: 18 Feb 2010  We booked this hotel for our weeklong stay in Mumbai mainly based on its #1 rating on TripAdvisor. And it is a unique little gem, really.  We have stayed at many hotels over the years, often luxury ones with impeccable details and fantastic designs.   It is the perceptive and friendly service that makes it worthwhile staying in this small family-run hotel. The owners and staff are social at just the right level and they go to great length to make you feel at home. In the afternoon, the staff would bring out snacks and coffee for guests who had opted to spend the day in the shade of the palm trees in the little garden. At no charge.  Even my family, who did not stay in the hotel, was received with open arms and exceptionally generously when they came to visit."
"The hotel service is no doubt excellent. But beware if you are there for the first time, try to get a room in palace wing (which is more expensive) as the newer building where they initially put me in has smaller rooms, my room was smelling of dampness, they tried to spray infront of me but I did not need to mask the smell so I changed to palace wing and paid more.. Even the TV in newer building are old 80/90s TV, I dont understand why they call it newer building..."
"The hospitality at this hotel is second to none. We are frequent visitors at the Taj for business and pleasure and I could not complain about any of the service from the porters, housekeeping, in room dining to the restaurant staff. The rooms in the Tower wing are in need of some refurbishment but still maintain a very high standard."
"Stayed in the old part of the Hotel and the rooms have been refurbished to the highest of standards. My room overlooked the Bay and the Gate of India.  The sercurity in the Hotel is very high but that is a good thing, you have to walk through a detector and put your bags through a scanner.  The pool area is large not alot of sun loungers but it was kept very clean and the pool staff were very helpful. The breakfast is better in the new part of the Hotel, there was more of a selection. But the food overall was fantastic.  I would love to go back and stay again"
One of the worlds great hotels. Simply 10/10 in all deparments. No need to add any more.
"We stayed here two night after traveling in the Punjab and Himal Pradesh for 3 weeks. We got caught up with the World Cup cricket at the Taj Chandigarh when we stayed with the Irish and West Indies teams and their WAGS. On arrival here we bumped into the New Zealand and Canadian teams. If its good enough for them, it is good enough for us. Seriously, we atayed in the Heritage Wing and had full use of the Club facilities and everything was excellent. Good food, great comfort and excellent and friendly service. What more can one expect?"
"What an amazing hotel. The service is some of the best we have experienced anywhere in the world. Sometimes 5 star hotels can be a little intimidating, and in the past I have been made to feel not quite good enough, but in this hotel I felt like a princess - Thank you!"
"Taj Mahal Palace is the quintessential ""grand hotel"".  It is 5-star in every sense of the word.  You can just feel the decades of maharajas making their way down the grand staircase here, so much history within these walls.  Today, it still feels grand, though of course it's become more casual with the times.  We really didn't want to stay at ""another stale 5-star hotel"", but our agent insisted, and this time we think they were right.  LOCATION -  The location is perfect for sightseeing and shopping for the average tourist.  Just outside you have the boats to Elephanta Caves, you have the horse carriages, all lit up in neon, and you have one of the posh areas of Mumbai, with its clubs, restaurants, shopping and ocean view.  There are always throngs of tourists out at the Gateway"
Felt at home and loved the opulence and friendly people.  Stayed in the Heritage Wing and it was wonderful.  Breakfast was a delight and the service was over the top!  Highly recommend
"For a hotel of this calibre and price point the service, both in room and restaurants was pitiful. On drawing managements attention to this, their attitude was one of arrogance and disbelief. Fortunately we were only there two days. Whilst we look forward to returning to Mumbai, great city, we won't stay at this hotel."
"I have stayed at the Taj twice this year and although I feel that it cannot be beaten on location, I have been disappointed both times with the quality of the room. The rooms in the Tower are relatively uninspiring. They are an adequate size but the decor and lay-out could be massively improved. I visited one of the rooms in the main (renovated) building and was extremely jealous.   The facilities of the hotel are excellent, I like the Storm Harbour bar and Japanese restaurant and the gym and pool are excellent. The service throughout is perfection."
"The flagship property of the Taj group is amongst the best hotel experiences ive had in india. The three best things about the hotel: 1) the location---colaba is a really nice area of bombay, captures the essence of  erstwhile colonial Bombay. It's not really central and very 'far away' unless you're working in nariman point etc. 2) the restaurants---WASABI, the japanese restaurant is comparable to nobu or zuma. Do not miss the the Black cod, it melts in your mouth. The green ice cream for dessert is a no-no. GOLDEN DRAGON is excellent Sino-Indian Chinese with the added touch of India's spices. The coffee shop has decent breakfast. I absolutely LOVE a capuccino at the 'Sea Lounge' which has an incomparable view of bobbing boats, colourful horse drawn carriages on the promenade,"
"My sister and I stayed here for 2 nights and just adored it! It is expensive but so worth it! The service is second to none.... just amazing! The staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. Food was good... we ate by the pool all the time. Location, pool and spa were just superb!!  We stayed in the cheaper Tower rooms and the room was nice but the view was so special..... we overlooked the beautiful gateway of India.  Can't say enough good things.... stay here!"
"Had 3 nights sea facing on the 17th floor of the Tower. Great room , great service. ate at the pool side and in Chinses restaurant and the Souk. Both lovely with staff very willing to help. Price as u would expect for Mumbais finest . Had a car with driver for the 1/2 day tour . The guide was great and very knowledgeable.  Security high in all the 5 star hotels and metal detectors in and out the norm. Better safe than sorry. Great Hotel in a vibrant interesting city."
"Pretty much everything ran like clockwork, can't fault much about this hotel. I had some business to do while my family (4 kids & wife) had to spend 3 days in Mumbai. Kids had fun in pool & around hotel, easy to walk to Gateway to India, shopping etc. Food in the hotel (we ate High Tea in Sea Lounge and had a dinner in Masala Kraft restaurant) was excellent & OK value. Nobody got too sick which we had been warned about. We were upgraded to Palace rooms after booking tower rooms online (Taj website actually had best rate) I had some business meetings in the business centre there which were well catered for & had all the facilities we needed. I'll be back there for sure! Negatives were that we could only purchase WiFi for one device at a time, difficult since we had 5 laptops/"
"The best Hotel experience of my life, I thought the Mandarin in Hong Kong was good but it does not beet the Taj. Little touches by caring staff add up to the best Hotel stay ever."
"The thing that sets apart this hotel from anywhere in India, is its historic location, its sheer imposing setting and the fact that is possible the best property in the repertoire of Taj's hotel. The flip side is that it is not as plush in the room services / goods it offers as opposed to newer hotels like leela. In bombay though, there is no other hotel you would rather live in . The food is great, the restaurants par excellence, the location perfect to see the best parts of bombay, and the view of the ocean and the gateway of india which is visible from almost every room. Quite an experience !"
"The internet listed rooms at 13000 Rupees a night ($290) and included one airport pickup or drop off.  I saw they had a 3 night special for 11000 Rs.a night that also had 20% off of food and drinks.  Once reaching the crumbling hotel in its putrid-sewage scented area by the ocean, I was told that the 20% does not apply to 4 out of 5 restaurants in the hotel.  Later, after returning home they charged an extra 7300Rs for airport pickup and drop off as the 'free' one is also not included in their 'special'.  So I paid more for their 'special'.  All prices at 'world' levels.  Offensive to pay $160 for airport transfers in a Toyota Corolla driven by a gentleman who is probably being paid $25 a week.  A  Vodka & Coke was $18.    I stayed in the Tower and the room was clean and had a"
"This hotel certainly has the WOW factor - the location, setting, security, service is all fabulous with fantastic views over the sea and the Gateway of India. I can see now why it is a tourist site in it's own right. They ran a heritage tour in the late afternoon which was great finding out about the history of the hotel and it's art treasures. The very rich and famous have stayed there for decades and yet they treat every single person as if they are special - they really want to give a good service. We only stayed for one night and in a relatively cheap room in the 8th floor of the Tower overlooking the gateway of India (we splurged for one night to say we had stayed there) and as it had been my birthday the day before, they still arranged for a cake to be made and delivered"
"Our room was spacious, clean and quiet. I loved the aesthetics of it as I did the aesthetics of the entire hotel. There are antiquities and modern paintings that blend together in a beautiful way. The hotel has history that goes back for decades, many celebrities did and still do choose this hotel while visiting Mumbai. Even if you don't plan to stay I would recommend planning a visit and maybe dinner in one of its 8 fine restaurants. I consider the hotel one of the top 5 attractions of Mumbai. The hotel is located in Colaba, one of the most touristic areas of Mumbai, it is next to the ocean and next to the Gateway of India."
"As a consequence of the terrorist attack the refurbished Taj Mahal Palace & Tower is swamped with security, which while comforting is a bit over the top.  Hotel has everything one would expect from this type of establishment. Unfortunately, the service in the breakfast area for the Palace was probably the lowest standard that we had encountered in a Taj hotel. Don't bother asking for an expresso, they just didn't understand.  Breakfast itself was fine, but not too exciting. At least internet access in the business centre was free, but you will pay if you have your own Wi-Fi enabled PC."
"The Taj Mahal Palace & Tower facing Mumbai's iconic Gateway of India promenade is India's first and most luxurious hotel complex.  The older Taj Mahal Hotel has large bedrooms overlooking the Arabian Sea and lavish dining and recreational facilities.  Especially noteworthy are the Chinese (Golden Dragon) and Japanese (Wasabi by Morimoto) restaurants, athough the hotel also has a Lebanese, Indian, casual 24-hour cafe and 2 bars!  The hotel has original antiques and paintings throughout the lobby and guest floors and suites.  The hotel gym, spa and salon are world-class, as is the banqueting facilites that can host approx 5,000 guests in their antique-chanderliered ballrooms.  I would rate this hotel as one of the best in the world!"
"very good hotel with great atmosphere, cleaniness,view,great hospitality service VERY GOOD AMBEINCE ,warm wellcome by the staff, service up to the standard,very good room service facility,staff are always helpful,"
"It was my first time in Mumbai, in India even, and I have never seen the old Taj. But my friends mother that was with us still liked it, even though in the old renovated part appartently not much resembles the old Taj. For me nevertheless it was an experience. Great morning breakfast, an incredible Sushi Restaurant and I can recommend to eat outside at the pool, you can sit there also in the evenings, and it just brings this great colonial atmosphere with the whole setting. You feel like you want to drink a Whiskey or a Gin Tonic like the Brittish. For smokers, the hotel is not very pleasant, there is only one smoking lounge outside, and if you stay at the old part you have to cross the lobby every time. My friends mother once was even sent outside the hotel (even outside"
It was wonderful experience visiting Taj and visiting Gate of India right across from the hotel and walking around. Food was tasty and people working in this hotel are very happy and courteous. I bought little things for my friends from the shops located in the hotel and pictures taken with my visiting friends were wonderful. I am sorry that I can not attach them as camera is with my son.
"We decided to stay in the newly renovated old wing with sea view rooms to both judge the fresh offering and support the Taj post the terrorist attack. It was wonderful. The renovation had been tastefully completed. Beautifully light and modern colours. Check in was as simple and graceful as always. The entrance was a slight hassle due to security measures but that was as to be expected. My room was decorated in lovely greens and blues reminiscent of the sea that it faced. Compliments of wine,seasonal fruits and chocolates were welcome. The beds were comfortable with the usual array of pillow choices. The electronic gadgetery was fully modernised. Breakfast was served in the large sea view room with attentative service. The croissant and dosa deserve special mention. We dined at"
"Taj Mahal Palace Hotel - Mumbai 25th June, 2010 My Husband had given me surprise gift as it was my birthday on 25th June. He had booked for one night stay.  The service was great as soon as we entered the hotel and we were given room on the 11th floor sea view facing.  From our room there was full view of Gate Way of India.  As it was my Birthday i got a very special treatement there was a cake and a bottle of Shampaign as a complimentary form the hotel.  When i had gone for massage i got a special gift form them and a royal treatement.  The most interesting thing was when i was in the reception in the evening there was live performance of the paino and as soon as he saw me he started playing Happy Birthday song for me.  It was a very great experience which i will never forget"
"The Taj Mahal Palace is right by the India Gate - it's a wonderful historic hotel, and it's wonderfully snooty!  Great rooms - try and stay in the historic wing with rooms that have a view to the India Gate.  It has an english book store and superb restaurants, including a Japanese one which you reach by staircase/elevator from their famous bar, the Marine Room.  Even if you can't afford to stay here, you should go for a drink and the view.  And finally, it has a pool at the back of the hotel - outside - perfect to escape the rigors of sightseeing in India!"
"On the whole the experience was very good. I stayed for one night at this hotel with my son. Though check-in took a while, other services were very good. I had forgotten to carry my Blackberry recharger and just a tinkle to the Guest services got a chrger in less than five minutes , I would say."
"I am a freequent traveller to India for business and have been coming to this great country almost every month since 2005. I have travelled the length and breadth of India and been lucky enough to stay in some truly wonderful hotels over the years. However, nothing has ever come close to the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai - it has a unique aura about it, great charm and elegance and the best staff in the world. If you are coming to India and Mumbai, it is the only place to stay!"
"Stayed at the awesome Club Room..... The bathroom was just amazing....   Full on royality treatment, from the reception, to the bell boy, to our own butler.... amazing...!!  Amazing pool!!! Food at the pool is amazing...  But I miss the old Golden Dragon, the new renovated restaurant & menu was not at all impressed...."
"Great hotel and very comfortable stay. Since it is in the heart of Mumbai i.e. Colaba area, it is very easy to shop around."
"Amazing location, building and beautiful facilities, a very special place with lots of style, a true treat"
"This was our first visit to India and therefore, to Mumbai.   We were recommended by friends who know India very well that the only place to stay was the Taj Palace and Tower hotel.  The location is fantastic.  It is in the centre of Mumbai overlooking the gate of India and the waterfront.  The security at the hotel was first class and we felt very safe staying there.  Your first impression when you enter the hotel is of tranquility and class.  The female staff are dressed in the most beautiful saris and the men were smartly dressed.  We were shown to our room which was in the tower on the third floor overlooking the gate of India.  The room was clean but ordinary and not what we had expected for a room at the Taj.  It had all the facilities you need, but it was lacking"
"This has to rank as one of our top hotel experiences. Service was excellent and was consistently so during our stay. The hotel itself was beautiful, as can be expected. Can't beat the location either, being situated next to the Gateway."
"Taj Mahal, Mumbai is the best hotel in the world. It really defines service, class, elegance and all the good words that you can think of. This is not a hotel, its an institution. The restaurants on the property are the best of class.   The service is beyond anything that I have experienced. Was having breakfast in the coffeeshop and a team of three waiters came and insisted that the weather is really nice and they would like to serve us by the poolside! Which meant, they had to move everything outside especially for us. They suggested it and happily moved us outside.   Ate three meals in the hotel at three different restaurants and each meal was a special treat with a signature dish which was so unique and eliciously prepared.   The feeling you get as soon as you walk into the"
"Stayed on the (top) 19th floor of the Tower part of the complex for a 2 night stay. Despite some of the reviews suggesting old decor, it exceeded expectations. I travel alot and the Taj was in the top few international hotels I've stayed at, by quality standards. Arrived at 7am after an overnight flight from Singapore. Air pick-up was efficient. Once at hotel, asked for an early check-in and by 830am was in my room. Room was comfortably furnished and bathroom, while not modern, was functional. Its hard to get away from Mumbai traffic noise, so even with windows closed I could still hear horns. Room attendant came quickly when needed and all calls to reception answered quickly. The hotel inner courtyard is highly impressive. I could spend days just lounging here. The gym"
"We stayed at the Taj on our last night in India, as we were flying out of Mumbai airport. We wish we would have stayed longer.  Everything in this hotel is perfect. The security, the staff at the reception, the concierge, the staff at the boutiques, the restaurants. everyone. We had a sea view room on the 10th floor; it was great to see the Gateway of India from that perspective. The breakfast buffet was the most extensive one that we had seen during our entire trip. Everything was delicious; a very nice gentleman took me through the entire to present all the different foods, and he even made some recommendations on what I should try!  We also had an afternoon snack at the Aquarius Cafe, it was very nice to eat outside in a delightful setting."
Our room was quite used and was not really adequate for a hotel with that reputation.  We switched to the Hyatt closed to the airport and the room and service quality you get there for a lower price is substantially higher.  The reason why I chose this hotel was for its heritage. Staff and owner seem to know that and rest on that pillow...
Fantastic service by all staff and rooms were very comfortable cant wait to visit again.
"We have stayed here before and there is an element of returning to an old friend as a result. We stayed again in the Heritage wing and were on a higher floor, very quiet helped by the fact that the roads around the hotel were shut as a result of the security scare. Staff great, pool lovely and right in town so easy to get about. We eat in the Chinese restaurant, there was 8 of us and we had an absolutely delicious meal with many suggestions from waiter which were scrummy! Wish we had stayed longer"
"This was my third stay at the Taj and my first since the Palace Wing was reopened. I stayed in a Luxury Grand room in the Palace for five nights on business. The welcome is wonderful and service generally faultless. My one complaint is that at times the service is too attentive - I have put on my 'Do Not Disturb' light and the maid still tried to come in to clean. This happened a couple of times. The room is spacious and luxurious. For me the best quality of the hotel is the food - either the restaurants or the room service -the food is heavenly. It is all a bit pricey even by comparison with the other 5 star hotels but the ambience, sense of history, fabulous food mean that I will stay again when in Mumbai."
"The Taj is immaculate.  It's a historic Mumbai hotel, with old world British charm, an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai.  You leave the crowded streets that overwhelm every aspect of your senses into this serene palace, overlooking the Arabian sea.  Service is impeccable.  I've never seen service like this in any western 5-star hotel.  The staff goes out of its way for the guests.  Sure--it's pricey, but not pricier than your typical western 5 star hotel.  But, you simply can't get this level of service elsewhere (I guess it's because the value of the dollar goes further in India, then it does in Europe or US).  One thing to note though---the security is immense.  Be prepared for an almost airport style security screening---scanners, pat downs, and vigilant eyes. "
"It is hard to describe the stay at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Everything is perfect. I don't have enough superlatives to describe the service, food, room standard, etc. The afternoon tea and the hotel tour is the most memorable things from the stay."
"Wow - we loved this place, one of the greatest hotels in the world and the Chinese restaurant served one of the best meals I've ever had. We were in the heritage wing and had a view of the water - amazing."
To stay in the hotel post 26/11 itself was an experience and never felt insecured. The spirit of hospitality was visible everywhere. It is an optimum combination of professionalism and hospitality. Though Lobby remains crowded and often noisy.I had a room in the tower overlooking the Gateway of India and it was amazing. Once again I will definitely regret the unavailability of free internet service. Indian hotels need to seriously look at this.
"Walk into the hotel lobby and see a seventies room that is poorly lit and badly put together, there is no sense of style in this lobby. Check in was perfunctory and relatively rude. Service was lacking in the extreme. We were shown to our room and not even shown the room, unexpected from india's supposedly most regal of hotels.  Our tower room resembled something akin to a bad European 3 star hotel, and had not been refurbished adequately for thirty years. Displeasure and heart break at $550 per night. They must have thought us idiots to accept something so sub-standard.  We complained, they moved us without question and upgraded us to a club suite, literally next to the same suite where Obama, sarzoky and Cameron all recently stayed. The palace wing is without doubt the nicest"
"This place lives up to it's name. Had excellent restaurants , nice bar , great staff. Although security was top , the hostel was very relaxing and nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city . Allthough expensive...well worth the break!"
"After two weeks traveling in Delhi, Agra and Rajasthan, we landed in Mumbai full of expectations about this hotel. It was quite disappointing. There are two separate hotel at the Taj, the palace and the tower. The palace is the one to choose, as the tower is totally missing the atmosphere and the charme of the hotel it is supposed to be. Our room was on the fifth floor, just okay in size, overlooking the India gate but with a net covering all the balcony so it was impossible to take even a single photo. The bathroom was very small, the carpet needing some quick maintenance. But the most disappointing item was the bed linen, so old to be itchy. We tried the souk restaurant a the top floor, nice looking but not a great food."
"We stayed At the Taj Palace hotel for two nights to end our India trip and boy, we could not have chosen better!    We were surprised by being upgraded two tiers to the Palace Club. We were presented with fresh flower garlands, shown the amenities we were entitled to, including Butler service and shown to our room which was breathtaking - I couldn't speak from bring so overwhelmed. It was simply gorgeous. The bed was huge.  The hallways were decorated with the owners private art collection which added to the opulence of the Taj Palace.  The room was spacious and immaculate, with lovely thick pile carpet.   We dined in the Chinese restaurant which had great food but not so great service.  The club lounge offered free Internet access and soft drinks throughout the day as well as a"
Beautiful property. Very well maintained. Great service. I would definitely go back.
"We were supposed to stay here for 4 nights in a ""Deluxe Seaview Room.""  We cut our stay short after only 1 night due to the absolutely horrible conditions.  First, the air conditioning smells horribly of mold. I have asthma and it made me sick. Second, when we got in our room and poured a drink, there was lipstick and spots on the glass.  Third, when we went to bed, there was a disgusting yellow stain on the sheets. The carpet is peeling up from the floors in several areas of the room.  The glass pane along the edge of the tub allows water to pass onto the floor while you take a shower. The walls in the room are dirty with hand prints on them. The wooden furniture is dented and damaged.  And another guest kept calling our room thinking we were the front desk, asking how he can"
"We stayed in the tower for a day and had an amazing time.  We are America's living in India for 5 months already, so we are used to the nuances of Indian accommodations.  For people that are complaining about this hotel, they are probably India newbies and don't understand this country in the least.  Yes the hotel is expensive but you are paying for one of the most historically significant hotels in India.  The hotel rooms are not 5 star, quality perhaps 4 at best but the location can't be beat.  You shouldn't be in your room anyway in this place.  The lobby, pool, restaurant, and service is unbelievable.  We just paid for a city room and got a free upgrade to an amazing sea view of the gateway.  The staff was courteous without being intrusive.  They let us carry our own bags"
"The Old Wing part of the Taj Mahal Palace is a wonderful hotel.  I cannot judge the main part of the hotel but suspect the room experience will be quite different.  The rooms in the restored wing are fabulous. I am asking for the make of the bedlinen!  The service staff was fabulous, unfortunately this did not extend to the kitchen staff.  The food in the mainstream restaurant was generally very average, the pizza with rocket and parma ham appeared without rocket, and the omelette contained a hair................The staff bent over backwards to make it right but really the main restaurant needs improvement."
"One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. Service was over the top, the hotel is in pristine condition and the staff was happy to see you. I will stay there every time in Mumbai."
"taj palace is one of the few places where you will be surprised, by the top quality service even before you ask for something. had ordered dal makhani for lunch fo my wife, and the manager gave us a free bowl of rice, just because he felt that no one has dal alone. the whole place makes you feel special, with rooms impeccable and service outstanding. you will not be disappointed"
"The service at the Taj is very good. The staff are very attentive, very polite, and very available. The food is expensive but it's fairly reasonable in the quality it offers. Raw fish at the Japanese restaurant in Mumbai just doesn't come cheap! We were disappointed by the room (in the Towers section of the hotel) as we had expectations of 5 star accommodation.....it was an average room you might get in a standard Holiday Inn hotel. Very surprised actually. The (Jiva) spa treatments were very good...obviously you pay a high price to get that. The location of the Taj is good for the business district. It's in South Mumbai so is far from the airport and the more 'happening' area in Juhu Beach for anyone looking to have fun. There are few sites to see in Mumbai of course; it's more"
"This was one of my favourite of the Taj Hotels we stayed at. We had a deluxe suite.The decor was modern but tasteful. The colours were pale natural tones and very soothing. The staff were friendly and helpful and we had no complaints whatsoever. There was a welcome gift of a chocolate cake, in addition to the fruit. Tea and coffee making facilities and bottled water are provided.  The restaurants are nice both by day and night. The view from our 16th floor window showed us part of the bay, and great view in general. The bathroom was particularly impressive as it had non-slip floors of some sandstone textured flooring.  Nice hotel. big rooms and bathrooms."
"This was my greatest experience ever. We had stayed at the palace. The rooms were amazing. Though I did not like their idea of charging for the wifi in the room. Had dinner at the ""Souk"" was simply amazing. Had stayed at the suit and had the greatest of the experience which I will never forget."
The Hotel is comfortable with all sort of amenities. The sea view from Hotel balcony gives a feel of beauty. The heritage look of the hotel gives a different kind of experience. It is worth to stay in the hotel together with family. The makets and shopping complexes are nearby where we can spend time with family enjoy the shopping experience. Food is good and memorable.
"Best hotel of India in order of Hospitality and services.I enjoyed my stay very much, they have high quality security checks.They have all kind of facilities and services. They are very intractive with their guests.They have high variety and quality breakfast. I will rate 9.5/10 to this hotel."
"The grandeur of the place totally enthralled me. The architecture is simply marvellous. The place is so beautiful from the outside as well as the inside that it gives you an out of the world experience. I am mainly a food person and the restaurants i should say gave me more than i had expected. The Sichuan restaurant, Golden Dragon is on the top of my list followed by Zodiac grill(french) , Shamiana(Indian) and Wasabi(Japanese). The rooms were excellent, the entire atmosphere was so good that we never felt like leaving the place and moving around!! The swimming pool was extremely beautiful with the poolside restaurant aquarius adding a midas touch to it."
"I ask for a shoe shine pack, they send me someone to shine my shoes. I ask for a a few fruits, they send someone to service the entire room too, I am down with a cold, they  send me a jug full of turmeric milk to recuperate with"
The tajmahal palace is just not a hotel but a heritage.  t he architecture reminds of pre independence era and has furniture and paintings which can participate the rare collectibles at museum.  the hotel is blessed  with several restaurant but my all time favourite is shamiana; specifically for its Makhani dal (cooked on choolah overnite).  location is simply superb overseeing the calm indian ocean and the great 'Gateway of india'.
"This Taj is in a wonderful location for a quick or an extended visit to Mumbai.  The views are wonderful and the hotel has a variety of restaurants and lounges to enable a visitor to take full advantage of them...even the Business Center offers a fabulous view of the Gateway to India!  Unfortunately I was put in a smoking floor room despite my explicit request to the contrary...but once I realized it the hotel promptly moved me to another floor.  The staff are the utmost in profesisonalism and customer service, ready to address the slightest need.  I got sick and lost my voice over the course of my stay, and, without my even requesting it, room service sent me a fabulous hot drink to try to help me recover.  Lovely touches like that make the Taj experience so special...I'm"
"Nothing beats Taj Mahal Palace for its grandeur, ambiance, impeccable service, and friendly staff. Ambling through its corridors touches you with the aura of the great lives who thronged its portals and spent beautiful moments here. People who created history. People who talked business to build India. People who contributed to the art and culture of incredible India."
"On arrival we were greeted by great staff, and we had a tour of the hotel at 5pm which was great to see all the hotel as you don't realise how large it is and to gain a understanding of the history. The rooms are amazing from the huge bed, complementary wine and Molton Browne toiletry's. The security is high with guards on every floor but it is not intrusive. The pool is great and very peaceful. There are a huge choice of restaurants and you would not have to leave this hotel for days with all the designer shops inside."
"Staying at the Taj Mahal was very royal and big on one hand, its location, the architecture, the feel is very grand. But it also has a very errie feeling for what had happened last year, and you still feel sorry for the people who were affected.  We stayed in the suite, and its was truly an Taj experience so to say. Its a mark abaove all the other business hotels one stays in, and here small details like what fruits are kept in the fruit basket, to keep bowls full of nuts, etc are details they have carefully looked at.  The location is simply awsum too. The rooms overlook the gate way of Indai and the sea, and its beautiful to walk by the seaside in the night overlooking the lit up boats.   The experience was grand as I said, we were glad we chose to stay there."
"told the reception desk, had a confirmation, yet I get a phonecall at midnight, claiming I had overstayed, in the morning my key-card had lapsed, so of course I was rather upset. I stayed at the old part, the Palaace, beautiful rooms, spacious, great view. However there were small details that I found irritating, especially for a place in its price class. I found the cleaning of the bathroom not quite up to the mark. I often got disturbed: if one does not put the ""no disturb"" sign, someone tends to walk in all the time from the cleaning, to bedmaking over to inspection to mini-bar fill up. As I was working in my room this was rather a nuisance."
"The hotel, after reopening is very cautious. The food in the restaurants were excellent though costly. The rooms are treated with extravagance. The service need to be improved to the 5 star levels. Convenient place to roam around near the sea. A luxury and costly place."
"Room in the Old wing are absolutely fantastic, but rooms in the tower are outdated at best. Great quality of service Great view on the gate of India Good food but not the best in town  If you are looking for a business traveller friendly hotel, you have better options in town eg Oberoi, taj president  If you are looking for a romantic trip, definitely the best in town"
"Stayed for a few days earlier this month on first trip to Mumbai in order to see what the fuss was all about. My take is that it's like most old restored hotels - a lovely building, clearly wonderfully re-done and a nice location, but small rooms that are nothing special. I agree with the previouis post that staff have plastic smiles, I had no sense that there was genuine help available. I tried to ask questions of front desk staff several times and gave up waiting to be served although there were clearly staff around. I've since stayed at the ITC Grand Central (a Starwood property), had a much nicer experience with better rooms at a lower price."
"My colleague, a 73 year old German attorney had a wound on his hand and he wanted a fresh dressing. We went to the front desk, where at 8.30am atleast four staff members were present with their usual plastic smile and no guest in sight to occupy their time or attention. None had any clue as to the nearest doctor, hospital, nursing home or any place to send this old gentleman. They did not even bother to check on internet . They did not even know where a 24 hr. chemist is located?  The same response from porter's desk and the smartly dressed sikh gentleman at the entrance. We decided to take s stroll around hotel and in the lane just behind the hotel we found a nursing home with a 24 hr. doctor in attendance who changed the dressing. On walking further in Colaba, we found a"
"Well... looking for some elegance with fun.. here is where u need to landup.  Taj is truely historical the moment you enter it. I was here with a customer from USA and was truely proud to showcase something which is so international.  Clean rooms, courtuos staff and proud history makes your stay completely thrilling. The food is simple awesome. In all a truely value for money experience."
"I really don't know where to start but when you enter the hotel you get this immediate sense that you're someplace really special.  The lobby is tastefully decorated in an opulent style that harkens back to a more genteel era - very welcoming.  The hotel staff was spectacular, as you might expect of a hotel of this caliber.  Everyone from the doormen to the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff was gracious, accommodating, helpful and extremely friendly.  The breakfast buffet was outstanding also - it offered virtually everyting - Asian items (dumplings, rice, idlis), European-style meats / cheeses and American items like pancakes and bacon as well as freshly-squeezed juices.   As for a few minor downsides, I do agree with one of the previous reviewers that the bathrooms"
"I was residing in Singapore when the terror attack happened in Taj and i was following on the developments post the attack and the reopening of the hotel was a demonstration of ""truimph of good over evil"" - with this background i was looking forward to visiting Taj on my recent visit to mumbai.  Apart from the initial security checks (necessary routine these days) which was conducted with a lot of grace the experience of the Taj inside was very much like the good old days - the simplicity ambience and the ""quiet"" all topped by some very courteous and polite staff (not overbearing) was simply superb.  The conference facilities the room and the acostics in the conference room was ""world class"" and i would highly recommend corporates to have one day conferences in these halls - i"
Taj Mahal Palace & Tower is a excellent property and I have stayed there on and off during the last three decades. Renovation work after the unfortunate incidence is outstanding and has added many modern amenities and decoration concepts. All the restaurants serve outstanding meals and cater to International varieties. The staff is well trained and extend usual Taj courtesies.
"As a devoted (and watchful) spouse I always accompany my Dearest on his business trips so that he never lacks for company.  We have had some lovely trips together in Europe where he spends the day doing business and I catch up on my shopping and spa treatments!  The world is changing, however, and my Dearest’s most recent business trip carried us to Mumbai, India.  We stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace.  This is my kind of place.  A sophisticated hotel that offers real luxury, character and world-class service.  We stayed in the old wing, king-sized bed with a sea view.  The room was a work of art with lovely antique furniture tastefully paired with clean modern touches.  For example, a rich cherry wood desk was intelligently matched with a high tech real leather office chair with"
"After all the huge destruction, its been rebuild with its own dignified style. People visit Taj now as a Heritage monument and not for a luxury hotel. Its been written in to history records and everyone are curious to know and feel the place of 26/11. The interestinga nd attracting fact is - Surviour Tree - The only metal tree idol has survived the blast. The stay for me was a memorable one and chance to Salute the people and staff who will be part of part of Taj in memory.""Once in a Life time must stay hotel"" our Taj Palace & Towers."
"In June 2010, I met up with a business colleague in his Taj hotel where he was staying and routinely stays on business trips to Mumbai. I was surprised at the roominess and cleanliness of the hotel. It is regarded as one of the premier hotels in the downtown Mumbai hotel area and for good reason. Everyone I know that stays there, shares my sentiment."
"taj mumbai: ""fantastic experience"" Date: 28 november  2010  We booked this hotel for stay and spend vacations there.      we had a great fun. enjoyed my honeymoon alot. stayed in honeymoon sweet. their service was very good. sea food was awsum. drinks were free"
The Taj Mahal Palace is exactly what and how you expect to be. Excellent service staff and rooms. Beautiful swimming pool area and public rooms. Has a little bit sepcial atmosphere like coming home.
Everything is awesome about this hotel. The opening lounge looks like a dream come true. Every part of the hotel is beautifully furnished. The service is marvellous. The restaurants are very good and food is excellent. The rooms are spacious and clean. The sea view from the hotel is the best part. Definitely the best of all.
"Enjoyed my time but would try somewhere else next visit. Located on the water by the Gateway, and close to some good restaurants, but a long haul from the airport.  Stayed in the Tower which, like most large hotels, felt a little eerie at times. Also a bit of late night activity at strange times. Sure the Palace side would be nicer.  Security was very present, including bag scanners on entry, but unarmed so I'm not sure how effectual they might be. India Army vehicle parked outside though.  Fantastic pool and central courtyard, wide choice of eateries, worth a couple of nights' stay."
"To Mention about the hotel, I think this is one of the best hotel in Mumbai.  Atmosphere is quite attractive and peaceful. I really enjoyed the food, the view through the hotel room glass is awesome. Hospitality of the hotel members incredable. Good to have best choices like this so that next time travel has no confusion which one to choose.   I have decided that whenever i come to mumbai ill definetly stay in this hotel."
"- Very kind and friendly staff - international location - good place for a stay in Mumbai, close to all touristic places - We have been in the Tower, very good view to the Gate of India but the rooms have been a    bit sticky and smelled mouldy, these are not fullfilling the five star rating which I expected - Bathrooms are old - breakfast was good, but it was not possible to get fresh brewed black tea... - At all it is to expensive, the value for the money is not ok"
"Absolutely marvellous !! The TAJ Mahal Palace, as it is now called after renovation, is absolutely stunning place to stay, i.e. the PALACE (HERITAGE) WING ! Superb rooms, passages, stairwell, ambiance, views, look, & feel - nostalgic, old-world, but thoroughlu modern, with all amenities you can think of. All this infrastructure is complimented by the finest service in India and at par with any in the world. Palace butlers are fantastic. Palace Lounge is a great place, and sooooooo many other fantastic dining/drinking options including the poolside Aquarius, Sea Lounge, Shamiana (24H COFFEE-SHOP/MULTI-CUISINE RESTAURANT), Masala Kraft (INDIAN), Wasabi (JAPANESE), Golden Dragon (ORIENTAL), Zodiac Grill (FRENCH fine dining), Souk (MEDITERRANEAN), Harbour bar, Patisserie, etc. The"
"Overall the hotel is beautifully refurbished in the Palace end, unfortunately the Tower rooms are not quite at the expected level.  However, the staff, general facilities, restaurant and overall service were impeccable!"
"When you enter into the large and beautiful lounge of the Taj mahal palace hotel you will get the feeling of entering into an Indian royal palace....both by the plush interiors and by the employees in their grand uniforms. The location of this hotel is very unique. You will love to look the sea through the windows for hours continuously. I arrived in Mumbai International Airport at 2am. They send me a chauffer driven car to pick up me. From the moment I entered into that car to the next day evening when I left the hotel lounge, my life was different. I felt like a King there."
"We stayed here for 5 days purely for pleasure as we were visiting family in Bombay. It was wonderful to see the renovated Palace wing reopened, it is such a lovely wing of the hotel and after all the tragedy of the attack a few years ago, fantastic that they have done such a sympathetic restoration. The service was first rate, friendly efficient and the staff really make an effort to help in any way they can without being OTT. We have been visiting this hotel now for over 20 years and look forward to the next visit. It is expensive but for a treat worth it. A lovely big pool which during the monsoon we often had to ourselves! Very good location for exploring as well if you want to be in South Bombay, very good shopping in the area around the hotel as well. Worth talking to"
"A dream come true  Since i heard name of this hotel, i had dreamed of staying at the Taj. This dream became  true. I would like to go again in this hotel."
taj hotel is very very beautiful. i enter the hotel i see a first good hotel in the world.
"The warm and friendly staff takes care of all meetings with great attention. The Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Mumbai also offers personalized Butler Service on its Taj Club rooms and suites, where the butler plays the all important role of guide and assistant.  The hotel has a well-equipped business center with five conference rooms, offering the latest in hi-tech broadband wireless internet connectivity, PC workstations, multimedia computers, laptops, portable printers and cell phones,."

"Taj Mahal Palace & Tower is an excellent hotel, as far as services and hotel goes. But there is a big problem of parking and traffic. Overall the hotel, staff, services are very good, I would like to recommend this hotel to all business travellers.  Best Experience: I checked in on 26th Jan and checked on 27th. After check out I came to know that I have to attend two more meetings and have requested the hotel for one night extension, they took only few minutes and provided me the room again. Really prompt and excellent cooperation."

"beutiful rooms to stay in, great outside view and professionalism of the staffs is just amazing"
"Since it opened in 1903, The Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Mumbai has created its own unique history. From Maharajas and Princes to various Kings, Presidents, CEOs and entertainers, the Taj has played the perfect host, supportive of their every need."
"April 14th to 20th,  Those were mavalous days. Fortunately we couldn't get any any hotels and through ""TRIPADVISOR"" found this hotel and been there.   I was with my wife, and i got a good name from her also. Service and rooms are fine and top class. Like to be there again."
"The Taj Mahal Intercontinental hotel in Mumbai is one of the premier hotels in India since its opening in 1903.This hotel in mumbai combines gracious architecture, luxurious accommodation and fine dining experience.

"Location is great.  The room we were given was disappointing.  Some rooms had been renovated as we could see this as we walked past them, but ours was very dated.  Not what one would expect at the price we paid.  I wish we had splashed out just a little more and gone for the new Oberoi.  I wouldn't rush back."
Actually... When I went to Mumbai...  I selected Taj Hotel To experiance the change after the attacks...  But As Usuall...  Taj IS the great.  It served me the same things which I ws served earlier  I am very happy with the hotel...  I am sure I will visit again..  Just A small suggestion...  Please decrease the rates...  Its very costly...  Overall - 99 %
"i  visited Taj mahal hotel in February, 2010. i found it one of the best hotels in India. The thing which i like the most in this hotel is the cleanliness and secondly, its outstanding location. Realy its history of india."

"We booked this hotel for our business meet in mumbai mainly based on its #1 rating on TripAdvisor. And it is a unique little gem, really.  We have stayed at many hotels over the years, often luxury ones with impeccable details and fantastic designs with good quality food and location."
"Last month i was to attend an important meeting which was near-by this Grande Hotel The Taj. I stayed there for 2 days and 1 night and the experience of staying there was really nice,i enjoyed the food especially veg and snacks.Service and everything was awesome."
We went on a business tour with some international clients with us.......  It was so historical everybody loved that place............ amazing big rooms ... Hotel was wonderful....everything we expected and the location could not have been better. Staff was very friendly and the beds were exceptional. Our room looked right over the Gateway of India ....... furniture could have been a little better as per me... the food was littler costlier side... but the stay was worth it............ laundry services was fast n good...  love to go again if got  a chance to visit mumbai again.
"Taj embodies much of the heritage and history of wealthy Mumbai / Bombay (as is pointed out on the nauseous self congratulatory video played in the rooms).  Service is fantastic & most staff are genuinely lovely.  Tower rooms are faded and would benefit from major upgrading, though remain comfortable.    Pool and spa are excellent  Found the restaurants overpriced and average in quality (though good presentation).  Much better Indian food at much cheaper prices available in London!  High tea was very good though  Expensive extras"
one of the best place to stay n visit in mumbai. the location is great  and the hotel staff is so professional. if anybody comes to mumbai this the place where they should stay

PROS * Awesome Indulgence! A friend treated me to a stay on my birthday and it was fab! Would recommend it as a weekend break even if you stay in Mumbai! * Unbeatable service! * Pool side chilling is great fun * Room Service menu is a Book! Get spoilt for choice without stepping put of your room  * The ONLY hotel I have come across with an Under The Weather menu in yr room! And it was totally handy as my friend had a sore throat and we ordered in the hot milk with turmeric which actually helped!  CONs Spa gets full so book a treatment well in advance maybe even before you arrive!
"Great hotel to stay at. The service was impeccable, the food was amazing, and the rooms were what you would expect from a Taj group of hotel."
"This is a 5 star hotel, I went to Mumbai for business and my friends told me about this hotel. And after going there I couldn't imagine, the service they provide is superb.  The best thing is that the variety of food they provide is just amazing. Also, beach is not far from this hotel.. :)"
"Truly wonderful hotel, luxurious, clean with a wonderful atmosphere. We were woken at 7am by a sitar concert right opposite our room. Only stayed there one night on way to Goa - but its certainly a night I will always remember"
"My husband and I stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower's (Mumbai) heritage wing for two nights after our wedding in March 2008. We're very much from Mumbai itself - but this was a great post-wedding break. It's the perfect place to relax because it's actually leisurely in the old-fashioned sense of the word. It has none of the modern, minimalist vibes!  The heritage wing suite was gorgeous, if a little dark in the day, and fully equipped: bedroom, walk-in closet, tub, sitting room, private butler service... The breakfast is like at any Indian five-star (with enough options) but the Taj service is definitely among the best. (Incidentally, all the room types are spacious and well-appointed.)   We had a lovely dinner at the pre-booked / pre-ordered private dining (for two) area"
"surely the best hotel i ever stayed in...  situated right in front of gateway of india, it is surely the best hotel in india. rooms, food, service everything was just perfect. we stayed for two nights and i can never forget that experience. it was simply superb.. mumbai is often called india's financial capital and it is home of bollywood. in this beautiful city this hotel is fantastic. i'm just waiting for my next trip to mumbai to happen so that i can stay here again..."
"The Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel is simply enchanting. The experience begins before your arrival when you are requested to complete a simple document identifying your preferences, for example, pillow and type of room.  I have been fortunate to stay in a number of spectacular hotels all around the world and this has gone straight into my top 5. The team at this hotel is absolutely superb! Every guest is treated like a VIP.   We were upgraded to the Taj Club room and we were met at the door by our Butler. I was presented with flowers, due to the fact that it was my 40th birthday and given a welcome drink whilst we competed the formalities of checking in. The room was a good size and was exactly what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre. We had an amazing – and I do"
"Stayed in an Executive Butler Room Suite Service was exceptional - white gloved butler available 24 hours a day Room is older, classic style - could use a renovation; but still very comfortable Depending on which room you get, you overlook the gateway of India - what a sight! Food was 5 star all around - nice restaurants, all of internatinal repute Security was tight, but to be expected given the post-terrorist attack of Nov 2008 Pool and fitness facilities were very well done There are newer 5 star hotels in Mumbai, but if you stay at the Taj Mahal, you get the classic feel that has made this hotel so well known."
"great hotel, great food, great service, great location,,,,"
Great monumental hotel by Gateway of India.  Great rooms. Great restuarants and food.  Complete experience.  Some good banded shopping in the hotel is possible.
I was lucky to get a sea view room and made the stay memorable. The hotel's old wing is full of culture and heritage and the restaurants are beautiful. Will love to stay here again.
"As far as business is concerned, it is a very prime location to stay and contact clients/customers. The name adds a kind of status to you and it is also very famous and well known in the city/India and outside world."
"I had been with my wife for 2 nights 3 days stay. MUST say ,had a blast at this Hotel. Service and Ambience is what I rate the best over here along with the night life papparazzi with number of cool restaurants. The location is what made me chose this hotel for our stay with the best of the view from windows along with rooms being quite huge. All in all we had a wonderful experience"
"Wonderful Taj. Excellent atmosphere, perfect staff, I wish to have again the chance of a holiday at the Taj."
"Excellent attentive staff (we kept getting complimentary items with our dinner/breakfast, and were waited on by several waiters at a time)  Clean good finishing rooms  Great scenery (overlooking either the city or the Arabian Sea)  This is probably THE best place to stay in Mumbai. Legend has it that the Indian founder was denied entry into the top hotel in Mumbai due to a policy of ''no dogs or indians allowed''. He swore he'd build a bigger and better hotel- and he did.  Famous leaders and celebrities stayed in the hotel, and we were lucky to stay there a month and a half after the Nov 2008 attacks on the hotel, as we got to see the amicable quality and energy in which the hotel is ran"
"in the morning we went to the taj hotel with my frieds.the rooms are big stylish and porshe,its ahotel looking like a heaven"
this hotel is not only beautiful but historic also. i just love to go to hotel again. this place is beautiful.
Its the place in mumbai. Right next to Gate way of india makes it even beautiful.  Service is amazing. Sea facing lounge is the attraction at Taj. You get everything you want at Taj.
The main plus point of  Taj mahal Palace & Tower is their room service... House keeping staff of taj mahal palace was very descent and used to provide services instantly... All over my visit in the hotel was excellent.
"My office has booked this Hotel for the business trip it was booked with the travel facility. So soon as we reached the Airport, driver was standing with the board with my & my colleague name written. He took us to Hotel & we got the keys of room from  reception. Room service was very good with the complementary drinks."
when  i went mumbai every time i visit Taj Mahal Palace & Tower its really nice and amazing hotel in mumbai
"Besides a pleasant stay, me and my family enjoyed many services offered by hotel Taj such as Swimming Pool, Large Lounge, Bar Area, Dinning Experience, etc. If one is at a holiday at Mumbai, then that person must prefer to stay in Taj Mahal Hotel only."
"Hotel was just adjacent to Gateway of India, rooms were excellent with one of the best room services in India."

wonderful . excellent . i cant  say . i have no words. this is the exceellent hotel.
"It is hard to be objective about value for money when one gets an incredible deal as part of a package but we were very happy with our experience when we stayed in the Tower. The service from everyone we dealt with was excellent and by the second day the Shamiana waiters were happy to chat with us and share their lives in response to our interest. The breakfast buffet here was excellent. Everybody was friendly and helpful from the front desk staff to the room attendants. The concierges were most helpful and delighted to share affordable dining options, spas and other leads outside the hotel as we requested. As a result of the November 2009 attacks, there is a very high level of security but there, too, one is treated with respect and friendliness is returned. The hotel has a"
"Staying in Taj is really-really a awesome experience. it has fabulous interior, flower decoration in every corner of hotel that suits to every mood, and make every face smiling. excellent service and ever smiling and ready to assist staff. food quality is also very nice. they had done quite researched on food and new dishes from every corner of world. words are less to define  taj. one only way to define it is!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!Waahhhh Taaaajjj.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
its a very good hotel its see view is very beautiful its srevice saf is well respected but its suit is very expencive...........
"Well yes it is famous and very well located but perhaps relies too much on that rather than being welcoming and friendly.  A bit impersonal.  Japanese restaurant expensive and mediocre, Indian restaurant limited menu and small quantity, main bar uncomfortable and cold decor, top floor Mediterranean restaurant could have been so much better.  Main cafe did a great breakfast and afternoon tea overlooking the pool was very pleasant and good value.  Air con made the rooms feel damp.  Overall, a grand hotel at a premium rate but something not quite right.  Hopefully once the refurbishment is completed it will settle down."
A very nice location and wonderful site surrounding with great rooms and room service with swimming pool.Atleast visit once in this hotel i am sure you will enjoy a lot.
The service in taj is extremely superior. They treat you as if you are a celebrity. The ambiance and the interiors of taj is beautiful. the name given to it the taj mahal is well suited    I would rate this hotel among top 3 hotels in asia.
"I had the pleasure to finally stay at this iconic hotel for 3 days/nights.  It's certainly up there at the top amongst colonial hotels with Raffles in Singapore and the Vic Falls in Zimbabwe.  I stayed in the Towers. Fortunately, being a smoker, so few hotels have many dedicated rooms for smokers, so was upgraded to an Executive room.  The room itself is a little tired. No flat screen LCD television here.  However, the room was spotless - it's easy to get spoilt in more modern establishments.  I found my bed comfortable and the bathroom was adequate - shower is in the tub. Complimentary tea/coffee/water/fruit.  I had a very nice view. Shame I found out on my last day that if I wanted to access my balcony, I could request for the door to be open. So something for others to"
"Execllent Ambience, view, food and service. I really enjoyed the stay. It was very relaxing."
"Wow!!! is the only word that i uttered for approximately an hour after i entered into Taj. The rooms were so awesomely neat and clean. Food was although not like we have our indian food, but yes definitely something to try for. Service feels so genuine and comfortable. It was an overall wonderful experience."
It is so clean and staff is so good they provide very good service.
Good Experience there were some places which were still under construction but did not other. Also there is too much security.
Visited this hotel more out of curiosity since I was in Mumbai in Nov 09. The view from the Hotel is amazing and the evening breeze makes you want to stay in this Hotel forever. The service was immaculate and the staff very friendly. The food was great as well and needless to say that the Taj group is one of the best caterers in India. Stayed there for 2 days and would recommend this to all travelers.
"i like to go once more in a life,  The Taj Mahal Palace & Tower is a prestigious luxury five star hotel located in the Colaba region of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, next to the Gateway of India"
It was like a dream come true to live in the taj after the mumbai attacks.The weather was good also making the stay more peaceful.They have strengthened the security after the attacks nad the permanent crpf battallion residing nearby adds to the sense of security.Best luxury hotel to live in mumbai in my opinion.
"Hotel Taj  Date: 10 Jan 2010  This is  the best place to stay in Mumbai. Pure luxury throughout and a fantastic service from the moment we arrive. The rooms are quite sizable, very well furnished including a sound system for CD, a DVD and computer all connected through a 40"" flat screen to four speakers around the room. The food naturally is excellent, and the breakfast, I would say, has the largest choice of dishes anyone could ever wish for, complete with an incredibly attentive staff. Excellent attentive staff ,Clean good finishing rooms.We also view  the Gateway of India and the sea."
"HOW CAN WRITE ABOUT THIS VENTURE OF PRESTIGIOS TATA GROUP---.THIS IS PRIDE OF INDIA ,SYMBOL OF INDIA---Great location since its in a quiet part of MUMBAI JUST IN FRONT OF THE HISTORICAL GATEWAY OF INDIA--- but yet a walk to the main street which is so full of life. The staff are friendly and attentive and nothing is too much for them.WIFI Internet is free as well as water in the minibar.So I think THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO VISIT ONCE----"
I was Traveling with my friend Chetan an other friends  to Bombay . I was going to Bombay just to watch the Bombay  . It was a unforgettable Time at there. I stayed  there in Taj Mahal Palace & Tower there . The services of hotel was royal i could not forget that hotal it was the bast hotel in india.
"cool place & best services of every person are very nice behaviuor, the best thing was that the looking of beach from the window & i like to go once more in a life."
"We stayed in a Superior room in the Tower wing since the rooms in the main building are not reopened yet after the November 2008 attack. The lobby is not clean, the rooms and bathrooms are outdated and desperately need refurbishing. There was a bad smell in the corridor. Breakfast selection is nice but bottled water needs to be paid for. Who drinks tap water in India??? On the terrace the service was very slow and the uniforms of the waiters completely worn out. In the Harbour Bar my coffee came after 20 minutes and was cold. This hotel needs better management and staff to be trained properly. compared to other Taj properties such as the Rambagh Palace, this hotel should not be rated 5 stars, rather 3."
"I have  stayed many hotels accross the Bombay, What attracts me to Taj mahal place is their hospitality and never say no attitude they have a solution for all your request.. It's a fully featured hotel and amazing quality of food.. The staff are friendly and taking extra care of person."
"The old building, opened a century ago and extensively refurbished, is one of the world's greatest hotels. Rooms are very large with high ceilings; those in front have spectacular views of the famous Gateway of India. Corridors have marble floors and walls and are decorated with museum-quality antiques. Four restaurants serve everything from snacks to gourmet (Chinese, Indian, and international) cuisine. There are many shops and boutiques. Service is attentive without being intrusive. The location, on the bay and near the commercial and shopping district, cannot be beat."

It is a nicehotel to stay with your spouce it has a good location. ambience is really good.
The best hotel in Mumbai.. Good food at shamiyana and Starboard. Totally royal treatment.
"I adore this hotel, the staff, the rooms, the location. I would never stay anywhere else in Mumbai. If you have a few weeks in Mumbai and can't afford a long stay there, at least spend two nights at the end."
"The Taj Mahal Palace has plenty of history and I wanted to stay there on account of the effort by terrorists to destroy this architectural gem.  Unfortunately, my short stay there was marred by the rude staff attending the swimming pool.  My son was very keen to swim at the hotel's pool since it was extremely warm and humid outdoors.  One of the pool ""attendants"" was very rude to him and to us.  The swimming pool has a few lounge chairs and he ordered us to sit on the floor.  He started playing ""favourites"" and assigned deck chairs to people he liked.  I would urge the hotel managers to monitor the actions of this pool boy because one day a customer is not likely to be as patient as we were.  Given its recent history, as a target of a terrorist attack, my wife was a bit"
Heavenly place. good or should I say the best food and very clean - very close to main CBD - rooms spacious - Expensive but amazing experience - renovation still going on to remove the scars left by terrorists - enjoyed the stay very much - food options were amazing
"The rooms are ok (if a bit dated), but the security is over the top - it gives the hotel all the charm of a prison. Did not feel comfortable and relaxed for a moment for the 3 nights we spent there - for the money there are many better (and more welcoming) five star hotels in Mumbai. The staff seem preoccupied with serving 'vip' and known guests, making the rest of us feel severely lacking in celebrity status. If you're like us and not the type to make a big fuss whilst on holiday, I'd say look elsewhere."
"From the point of entering the hotel to the point of leaving, i never felt like I was staying in a hotel. It felt like I was staying in an 18th century palace. It was actually built in the 1850s by the British who came to India. I would personally recommend everyone to take a room facing the Gateway of India. In the evening, there is a splendid view of the sea with the shimmering lights of the Mumbai skyline."
The hotel was very comfortable and was totally worth the money.
"Perfect location by the gateway and the royal feeling like that of a king, make this stay simply majestic. The treatment by staff is what actually makes you feel like a king. Yes, its expensive and very, but still worth most of what you have paid. It also good for newly weds."
It is a luxirious hotel with no comparison . it is a vintage hotel.everything from food to rooms is excellent.You need lot of money to stay in this hotel with every facility in it. realy it heart of mumbai
"We stayed here for 2 nights (but really 3 full days) at the tail end of our 2-week Northern India trip.  We knew in advance that the palace rooms had not yet re-opened but we were upgraded to a seaview suite in the Towers.  The service in this hotel is truly exceptional from top management to butler.  Our travel agent had informed the hotel that it was my wife's birthday and they sent no fewer than 4 arrangements of roses to our room, with one set of white roses being individually presented by a staff of butlers, as well as a set of luxurious skincare lotions.  She also received a personalized birthday cake and a bottle of champagne (although this may have come from our travel agent).  The location of the hotel is perfect and the security is excellent and very efficiently"
"Excellent location,Truly Indian,courageous staff. One of the best hotel in india which resembles the owners TATA name & brand quality. One must visit the hotel ,if you are in mumbai."
Exceptionally magnificient hotel and tourist attraction.Excellent food and service.India is proud to have this best hotel on its land.
"great hotel,  nice to stay even for a while, near a great monument. in mumbai"
"The Taj Mahal Palace & Tower is a prestigious luxury five star hotel  located in the Colaba region of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, next to the Gateway of India. Part of the Taj Hotels, Resorts and Palaces, this iconic 105-year old heritage building retains its stature as the flagship property of the group and contains 565 rooms. From an historical and architectural point of view, The Taj Mahal Palace and the Tower are two distinct buildings, built at different times and in different architectural designs.  The hotel has hosted a long list of notable guests including The Beatles, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Bill Clinton, Jacques Chirac, The King & Queen of Norway, The Duke & Duchess of Kent, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, Roger Moore, Joan Collins, Mick Jagger, Deep"
It feels like Royal Staying & Excellent Food & staff was very Supportive.
"Its an awe-inspiring historical property. Stay here if money's not a problem and experience every luxury. Great service, fantastic rooms and views, lovely restaurants (must try Souk) and killer location."
"Problem with reviews about Indian hotels is that sometimes they're written by Indians themselves whom are quite prepared to settle for something that Westerners wouldn't tolerate. But this hotel really does deserve its praise with exceptional service, beautiful marble clad interior with everything you'd expect from a 5* hotel. The spa, rooms, outside swimming pool area, restaurants and shops are places of sanctuary form the manic streets of Bombay. I will definitely stay with the Taj hotel group again, after they kindly assisted us with our requests, but not least the pleasant and relaxing stay, replenishing our energy after an exhausting holiday.  The only negatives are that even on the 14th floor, which we were, you can still hear the constant horn noises from the cabs. The"
There is already so much written about this landmark hotel that I wouldn't expect this review to add much.  I just think experience of the famed Indian hospitality is not complete till you have stayed at this magnificent hotel.  The staff treats you with the respect you deserve regardless of your loyalty status which cannot be said of most hotel chains in the West.    The hotel offers great views of the Indian Ocean and rooms have classic art decor.  Besides it has some of the best restaurants in the city- Golden Dragon and Souk come to mind.  There is great shopping nearby in Colaba and fabulous walks . All in all a great stay
Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai is surely amongst the most beautiful hotel i have ever stayed in India. The heritage wing in the hotel is incredible...makes your feel like a royal guest.  The rooms are huge and i loved the large LCD TV. The Indian and Chinese restaurants on the ground floor are truly world class. It was surely the most pleasant stay in Mumbai ever.
We ended up here for a 3 night stay after a tough but enjoyable trip round India.  What a great place to end up in. We wanted heritage rooms but sadly these are still being renovated after the terrorist outrage. We were given a small room on the 19th floor with fabulous views of the gateway to India and the Arabian sea.  The furnishings and bathroom were fine but compact! Downstairs is where you want to be.  The public rooms and the area round the beautiful swimming pool are outstanding.  Plenty of staff cater to your every whim.  We ate breakfast and dinner overlooking the pool.  Great food and service.  All the staff know ther history of the hotel and all give the impression they are proud and honoured to work there. We could have easily spent a week there.
"We stayed in January at the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower for three nights in a high floor sea view room. The view is incredible from there right towards the Gateway of India. Due to the 2008 attacks, the hotel seems to have a lost quite a bit of its charm since security is understandably very high. But it still has not lost the aura of the 'old days' and that's what makes this place unique compared to the more stylis new hotels in other parts of the city.   The rooms are spacious and comfortable, though it was a shame that the windows would not open!  We have not tried the restaurants even though they looked pretty. We had tea a few times at the pool which is a pretty place but all in all both food and drinks are very pricy and breakfast is not included. We found a very nice cafe"
still undergoing refurbishment but most of the public areas are back in action. The room was average but the view of the gateway to india was excellent. The food was good - the breakfast buffet was the most extensive I have ever seen and the service in the restaurant was terrific. Not a heritage type hotel like the Imperial or Rambaugh Palace so little to distinguish it from many other 5 stars.  The area around the swimming pool was particularly pleasant.
"Very good hotel- stayed before 12 years ago, despite terror attack in Nov.2008, excellent attiitde, excellent security.  Food and drinka are a bit over priced- otherwise we loved the hotel!"
"Great location close to the tourist sights (I guess its a tourist site itsefl), and even a couple of funky designer clothes shops etc... instead of your usual handcrafts!  Rooms are basic 5star rooms, nothing more, service is generally first rate. Restaurants are mixed - Souk on the top was very good, the Indian downstairs was average, and the coffee shop was terribe.  A lot of tourists in and out of the lobby and the cafe/coffee shop which might explain staff attitudes and inability to take orders or correct them.  Overall recommended as its an icon of India, but expensive for what it is.  A must is to check out the self-indulgent video history of the hotel.  Even shows Ghandi inside it, almost implying he approved of the expense!"
"My first return to the hotel after last year's attack.  The room still looks a bit tired and not up to the latest standards. I understand management is busy upgrading those rooms that were more heavily affected by the attacks. My room still had an old-style TV and I don't like the bathtub without real shower.  The plus (as often with Taj properties) is their staff. Attentive, smiling and thinking. Housekeeping showed the usual Taj-like attentiveness. My shoes found themselves in a shoe bag, cables were nice rolled up (I don't even do this so nicely myself!) and all clothes very neatly folded away.  Security is very tight; your taxi cannot enter the hotel anymore. No major inconvience as the attendant will lead you to taxis waiting nearby. Even by foot, you can only access the"
"The Taj is just perfect, in every respect. Particularly the bookstore (why do not all hotels have good bookstores?), the spa, and the yoga classes. And the small little things they do for you, such as putting a yoga mat and a yoga deck in my room. It is just unforgettable!"
i stay at new building at taj old building is under construction..so its enjoying its too good corydor. its so specious room @its good ac room for those who have comfor peple........its too good.. its nice........taller than the man ..bigest thank to ratan tata....to build up hotel...again
i found the hotel a paradise . It was a perfect experience for me and my family.
HI that was an absolutely extradinory stay on the hotel. the building is the main plus point for the hotel its looks like an kings fort . I want to tell you something about the loby.its full of ancient arts and the colourful lightning its all looks like a dramandes function in a fort .then the rooms available in the hotels are very convinient to stay .then the foods  are like a traditional indian dishes i like it very much. the swimming pool has attracked by all the gueste and tourists.moreever the stay in that hotel is an complete entertaining trip to me and my friends.
it was superb hotel for all.i was ther for two days to handle the evnts..this is best hotel to through the evnt bcoze this hotel provides u best service to their valuable customer..
i just loved my stay at taj
"This hotel is amazing, wonderful location, excellent view, great food and tourist's paradise."
Well its the best of all I've seen in my life.Its one of the most expensive ones in the country as its a 5star hotel. Even its tea costs Rs.380 so you can expect the rest.The service is superbe.the view also and the most auspicious thing is its interiors and rooms
i think it should be selected as un heritage site
"My first visit to Mumbai was when it was still known as Bombay. I remembered it fondly as my friends and I bumped into Goldie Hawn and Sally Field, and they stopped to say hi to us!  At that time, we had wandered around the Taj Mahal hotel to see what's so great about it and was very impressed. I told myself then that I will stay there on my next visit.  My wish came true! This hotel is so full of history and is extremely grand. I feel like a King living during the colonial times and were waited on hand and foot.  My room was huge with a separate breakfast patio facing the sea, separate dressing room and a big bathroom. My bed was a four poster king size (but of course!) and the service is excellent.   Old world charm to relive the romance of the British era  Prime location,"
Hotel is very good at hospitality & fooding is ultimate.
We stayed for one night at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai and I have to say it was one of the best hotel experiences I have had. We stayed in the old part of the hotel which was just so grand and luxurious. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left the staff were courteous and helpful. My only complaint was not having the time to stay longer!
"Stayed in the Tower as the Palace is under extensive renovation.  We wanted to stay here because of its convenient location (we had limited time in Mumbai) and, frankly, to show support after last year's attack. Security was thorough but it wasn't a burden. The desk staff was very helpful/gracious but they often seemed a little unclear as to what was included in our Deluxe room rate (complimentary breakfast, high tea, etc.).   Try to confirm these benefits when you book to avoid confusion when settling up your bill.    The Tower has a lot of activity and has a bit of a business hotel vibe but the upper floors are very quiet and well staffed.  Our ""butler"" was very helpful but never intrusive. After a sticky haggling filled day in Mumbai, we were very happy to come back to the"
This place rocks.................. Its very grand and magnificent too......... And all the staff are very polite and helping............And its very spacious......... It has a sort of a very grand but still very modern feeling about it............
I loved the system they have for huge visitors from sales to service everthing is fabulous.
1. the japanese hotel in the restaurant is the best in the world. 2.it has a beautiful scenery overlooking the gate way of india 3.the swimming pool is huge
I loved Hotel taj mahal becouse nice bombay so i liked it
It was amazing...Taj group is already famous....its quality is excellent.....me and my friends are enjoyed its excellent qualities of room etc.taj mahal palace is very good design of a hotel....
"Taj Mahal Palace & Tower is an excellent hotel, as far as services and hotel goes. But there is a big problem of parking and traffic.  Overall the hotel, staff, services are very good,"
"Fantastic service.  Great pool and spa and the food is very good.  There are some really cool shops located on the ground floor.  The lobby and restaurants are well done.  The rooms could use a rennovation, and the tower is still closed down.  There is still scaffolding on the outside of the building from last year's attacks, which hopefully will be coming down soon.  Security seems tight, with metal detectors going in and armed guard at entrance, and army trucks across the street.  This was a welcome sight and not intrussive or cumbersome in any way.  I would highly recommend this hotel based on the excellent service and warm staff."
"unique hotel in the world, excellent sea view"
"I stayed in the tower and the rooms are standard 5 star and very comfortable.  They could probably do with a little money spending on them as has been said before.  That said, I would definitely stay there again.  Bathrooms a little small, but everything is provided and the toiletries are excellent quality.   The service is superb and everyone strives to make your stay a special experience.  Breakfast is very good with all tastes catered for.  I ate in the Indian restaurant which is superb albeit a little expensive.  The pool area is great, given it's in the middle of a city.   Security is very tight which is comforting.  You and your luggage are scanned every time you enter the hotel and there is a guard on every floor.  The public areas are stunning and the hotel has a great"
I have nothing but praise for the Taj. An exquisite experience that we'll always treasure. The staff couldn't be more helpful. Make sure that you order a room with a sea view. Definitely worth the little bit extra.
"Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, is a Mumbai Icon by all means and that comes ringing.  Its location is its greatest asset. Its a kind of hotel you are in and out 10 times a day, for shopping, for a quick movie ar Regal or Eros, just walking to flora fountain, a private boat ride, horse carriage rides for the kids, and the list goes on. After staying 3 nights in Tower, my kids still want to come back when Palace wing opens up.  The service is OK, nothing to write home about.    Food in Souk and Wasabi is sensational and priced for kings :-).   But breakfast, High Tea or Cocktail hours service as well as food for the Taj Club floor customers is less than many 4-5 stars.  But of course, the nearby food icons - Bade Mia's paratha's, Khayber, Leapold, etc. makes it up.  We will be there"
"A quite satisfactory stay in taj with all the latest business need....spacious room,clean n ofcrse well attended staff....hope to get in to taj again on my business trip..........cheers"
"The hotel, its food, service, appearance, looks, staff, facilities, all were superb, and i spent one of the best time of my life out there..  Will always cherish the memories of the stay.. i love the taj... I would rate it 10 on 10... Do try it out.... !! Peace!"
Great location. Great service.
"OK it didn’t start well – travel agent error or hotel error? – we will probably never know.  What was certain was arriving at 2am in the morning didn’t help and our reservation being incorrectly supplied to a full hotel sealed our fate.  Booked a deluxe, non smoking, sea facing room but we got an ordinary, smoking, city view hovel – room 1216.  We were upset for three reasons – the error for which we do not blame the hotel, the several lies the staff told us which we think were pathetic (e.g. it is a smoking corridor but this is specially made up as a non smoking room (translation we sprayed extra fabreeze around)) but worse the room was at best a bad three star.  Stained, smelly, small (bed not king so probably normally used as a single), damp sheets (we suspect the spray to"
The Taj hospitality is legendary and they live up to it. The hotel now has almost become a symbol of the Indian resilient spirit.  The grandeur of the entire furnishings is extremely impressive. The food is quite good though more than slightly pricey but then value for money was never a criteria!. The rooms are good and spacious even if the windows seems small. Overall a good experience.
"When planning my trip to Mumbai, I couldn't imagine not staying at a property with such a storied past and such a tragic recent history.  In general, I loved the hotel but there are a few things to think through, most of which other reviewers have noted:  The Positives: The hotel is an icon of Asia and just being there imparts a special feeling. The pool is superb and transports you to a more genteel time in our world. The restaurants are truly excellent and offer a wide range of great cuisine. The service is virtually faultless and people want you to have a great experience.  Things to Think Through: Some tower rooms are renovated and some are not. The unrenovated rooms are tired and below usual Leading Hotels of the World standard. Renovation of the palace can create noise"
i go to this hotel in feb-08.. environment of this hotel is good... all staff and manager good supporting & ready to help any time.... they give very quike service...to the room... for my experience...this good one......for business and family stay...
"We spent an overnight here on the last day of our Indian tour and to take in a day's sightseeing in Mumbai. Perhaps we had been over spoiled by our other Taj experiences, but although the ambience of the Hotel's public spaces and restaurants are fantastic, the Tower rooms - which are the only ones open at the moment- are distinctly ordinary. The first room we were shown ( a so-called deluxe on the 16th floor)  had a really outdated bathroom and there were bits of food on the carpet from previous occupiers, After seeing another room and rejecting it, we were given an identical room but with an updated bathroom on the 18th floor. This room had no handle on the balcony door. After a number of phone calls a man arrived and handed us a handle which we were supposed to attach"
It is truly the best hotel in Mumbai. Superbly furnished. BEst sea view and facing the Gateway of India. CLose to most tourist spots. Great  food and outstanding service. No complaints
"Well i really enjoyed my stay here, the view over the Gateway of India is also amazing, the rooms, beds, facilities are all up to standard. with great television/reception channels for when you just want to relax. However the main problem was that there was sometime too much noise outside the rooms and the beds felt damp, this we found out was because of building which had take place recently."
It was my birthday and my husband had booked a weekend in Taj. It was one fabulous break. The hotel is awesome. The moment u step into it u feel u r privileged few. The staff is exceptionally polite and helpful and also well informed about the Hotel's history. Part of the hotel was closed to the public due to the 26/11 tragedy. We dined @ the Souk. The Hotel's Mediterranean Restaurant. The cuisine was new to us yet the dishes were quite delectable. We were seated at a corner table with full view of The Gateway of India and city lights of Mumbai. The table was specially decorated with flowers since it was my bday. Dinner ended  with a very yummy cake from the restaurant's own bakery .
"It is a beautiful place ,  full wit heritage and fantastic ambience.. i loved my stay there..the staff is over friendly and the food is the best. i loved the resturants in the hotel specially wasabi, it is the best food i have eaten so far."
"We just witnessed the exotic beauty of the Taj when we landed there on our auspicious night of our Life.. My first Wedding Night spent in Taj. Keeping aside all the worries and unforgettable memories of the terror struck Taj last year, we chose Taj for this auspicious night of my Life and it truly has rediscovered itself after the terror attacks.  Our welcome was magificiently handled with pleasant and courteous staff. When we entered our honeymoon sweet, i thought that I haven't made any bad decision at all by selecting Taj.  Beautifully decorated and magnificient ambience just attracted us towards the room immediately and then we were lost in its pure serene ambience.  The next day, we spent time in the pool and evening we checked out.  It was truly an effort of Taj executives"
i have beem twice to this hotel excellent view room are great  however they closing a  night club  which imake me feel sad i really enjjoyed club located near swimming pool  but  food services and over all i guess one of the best ever hotel i stayed
This is a great hotel in every aspects. The most notable part is the customer service. The room service asked us whether we need a photograph. He almost laid himself on the floor to take the photograph. I was a little late for the flight. The reception called the airline to make sure that I will get into the flight. In fact the Jet Airways folks were waiting for me at the airport. These are some of the examples.
Had a good time with my family there.
"the rooms were not very cleaned and not as luxurious as we might have expected, considering the reputation of the hotel worldwide.  The food in the coffee shop was terrible one night, the staff was very slow in getting what we requested once having meals.  I thought altogether it was a poor experience and that the Taj is not worth the money you pay for the priviledge of staying at such a mythical establishement"
one of the best hotel in india. Staff is courteous and give you the space.  House keeping is good.   have some fond memories of evening time spent along the poolside.
I found it really good to stay at the hotel as it has a really pleasant atmosphere and i feel that it is best location to stay in the crowded city such as mumbai so must have a visit there and feel this great experience and then you wil surely be thankful to me
Its a very loved ones hotel
after the terror attack. i afraid to go there. but the security level is good and no thinking to afraid at all. the service they provide. is excellent. the view of gate way of india and the sea shore is awesome. atleast once a each indian should stay there. or esla they miss a great thing in their life. great. great ! no other words to say. even the cost is high. worth to give.
"As the jewel in the Taj group crown, this hotel is steeped in colonial majesty and has a real sense of the decadence of another era. The grandeur of the decor and public areas is superbly complimented with exquisite service. It really is a beautiful hotel and its worth paying the extra to get a sea facing room as you will have a great view out over the Gateway to india. The personal experience is unrivalled from the moment you arrive to every step of your stay. We were bowled over by the way we were treated. Every member of staff was helpful and nothing was too much trouble. It offers an adequate base for exploring Mumbai, and althought we covered most of it on foot I would definately recommend speaking to the travel desk, or making an arrangement locally to get a driving tour."
"Seriously.  If you want to know what the gold standard of service is, stay here.  In all my travels staying at some of the best rated hotels in the world, nothing compares to the Taj Mahal's devotion to guest happiness.  Too many examples to share.  Room had unbelievable view of the Gateway to India.  However it could do with some upgrades - carpets were tired and so was the marble bathroom.  I never thought I'd say, I could live with this for the awesome service at this hotel.  Try out the spa for Indian massages and yoga.  Dine el fresco on the charming patio by the pool.  Indian Breakfast was terrific."
"We had booked two de luxe rooms however I was given an executive suite plus all the services including a butler.  The hotel facilities and staff exceed expectation nothing is too much trouble.  The hotel architecture is fabulous, the food and service is second to none.  This is indeed a splendid and luxurious hotel."
Simply the best service and utmost attention to details !!!
"Best you can get in mumbai, good location, needs small refreshment "
"The service staff at this hotel are really the best and this clearly is part of their mission from the restaurants, cleaning staff, hotel drivers... every person affiliated with the hotel was completely on their game and contributed to our positive experience.  Location is tops and you can walk or take a short taxi to many of the interesting south bombay neighborhoods, restos and attractions.  The hotel itself is an architectural gem (the old part)  Great bookstore and shops in the hotel. We tried 3 of the 4 restaurants in the hotel (to be reviewed separately) and every one was top notch and exceeded our expectations.   Due to our business/leisure nature of our trip, we stayed in both superior and deluxe rooms, cityside and seaview side.  The deluxe rooms are much nicer and"
"We stayed in the Taj Mahal Palace for 3 nights and were very happy with the hotel.  Although there is still some renovation work going on, and some of the restaurants are closed, the work does not affect the main public areas and there is still an ample choice of bars and restaurants to enjoy.  The location is excellent and is well worth paying for, as a lot of the attractions that you would want are within walking distance.   The Gateway to India is right at the front of the hotel, as is the departure point for boat trips to Elephanta Island, and the Regal Cinema is only one block away and is a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.  We stayed in the tower, and while are room was not large, it was perfectly formed.  The bed was comfortable and the air conditioning"
"I don't have a bad thing to say about this hotel.  They are still remodeling, but (as of July) most of the hotel except the old lobby and bar is open.  As a guest, you'd never know that the remodeling is going on.  Our room in the tower was very comfortable and had an excellent view.  The staff was always ready for any requests we had.  We ate in a few of their restaurants.  Souk had top-notch middle-eastern food, and impeccable service.  The breakfast had excellent continental and North Indian options.  Even the Mexican food at the Sea Lounge was edible, which is not the norm in India.  When we wanted to go to some neighboring places to eat, the concierge helpfully made reservations.  Location is also great, in Colaba, near the gateway of India.  Getting a cab was easy, though"
Service was excellent from check-in to check-out. Room was very nice and refreshed twice daily. Attention to detail was evident. The breakfast was exceptionally good and lasted until 11. Dry cleaning service was good. Location is also very good. Downside: The wifi internet access was a bit expensive.
"I just visited Taj Hotel on 5th Aug 2009 as i went for Rakshbandhan their..last time i visited that place for short time unfortunately on same day of that shameful incident 26/11 happened. And I wanted to visit that again for sure.Thats why i selected that hotel to stay. I got immediate assistance at Airport and i was pleased with the service. Still few sections are closed and renovation is going on. I found security very tight this time. It was good before too but now its way way better this time.  It was a short stay of 16 hours and i spent some time at lobby , pool area and went out for a while. Over all I found it very good and will visit again for sure."
The hotel is simply the best in the world. Went with my friends for a aprty time. Spent all my time gazing at the beauty of the hotel.
"If you can afford it, dont miss staying here"
"The Taj hotel is a part of history and a must see for people visiting Mumbai.  The service is outstanding, the best I have ever witnessed. Due to the terrorist attacks on the hotel last year only the tower was available to guests in terms of rooms and though the rooms are  a little outdated the views are amazing. Our room overlooked  the Gateway of India, and the Indian Ocean, which is stunning. I would strongly suggest using the hotel chauffeurs as it is really quite reasonable to hire them on a daily basis and it will ensure you will have air conditioned transport at your fingertips. I would also suggest using the spa, as they have many unique treatments to try out and again the service is amazing."
I never thought that my honeymoon will be in Taj Mahal Palace & Tower.. Its was my never ending experience. My hubby had surprized me by giving such a lovely exp.
"my friends decided to visit mumbai to experience the fascinating financial capital of the country ""mumbai"", we were also very much clear that we are going to stay in one of the finest in the world and the choice was obvious the ""taj palace"". it was really very amazing to see the glare and happiness on the faces of the staff which served us like the ""jinni"" of alladin,from getting us a wine to dinner which was as delicious as home made or i should say even better.the variety and delicacy of cuisines was also worth a notice.overall it was like staying in heaven with almost everything available to you"
i had a best experience in taj mahal ....pride  of indian hotels near juhu beach... great hospitallity.. loved the stay there.
"I went hotel with mine friends because of hobbies and enjoyment. Our aim before visiting was to get very good experience of refreshing and entertainment. Hotels view,mangement,food,cost is awesome. Lets start with view, hotels view compared to other hotel is outstanding and feel like as we are in hill station and out of city. Hotels interior is simple and not extraordinary and feel like that we are at home only.Rooms are quite big and comfortable.Next come food is really very good.Compared to other hotels we feel sleepy after having lunch or dinner. In fact we made an outing after the lunch.Food was like homemade only with fully continental.Next comes management was really user friendly because when we went mine one friend got sick so they really cared for us & gave very good"
"Taj Mahal - excellent service, really hospitable best views but rooms are outdated and small for the price they ask (at one moment the bathroom door broke and we had to wait for about 10 min) . Breakfast also expensive and no places nearby to get by in the morning. We complained about the room and they  offered the most expensive restaurant we had been - but we actually spent quite a lot in their restaurants so I guess that is why they offered one."
"Very beautiful and a peaceful place to come and live with ur family..being opp the gateway of india , this place anyways attracts a lot of tourist..but the food and the saty the this hotel was excotic."
"A dream come true stay at the hotel with the family.  The room overlooking the Sea, the pool with fantastic surrounding, the amazing restaurant and the service at its best.  You can't think of a better hotel in India for memorable stay"
"Staying at the Taj Mumbai has a charm by itself which is very difficult to express.Like most wedding couples we spent our wedding nite, at one of the suites.It was excellent, the suite was just out of this world very high standards, great service.since this was a special occasion they really go that extra mile.This was one hotel stay which was by far the best and a very memorable one."
"I must admit, I was apprehensive about staying at the Taj. For anyone who has been visiting Bombay every year as a child, it makes you pause. Also, during my previous trips I was taying at the Oberoi which is still under renovation. Its when you close in near the hotel you realise what a grand building it is. Made of stone blocks with its imposing domes, are verandah arches and the British style arhictecture.   I learned from the hotel coffee book that the Taj Palace was built about 140 years ago and the dome added about a 100 yeasr back. My room was bang in front of the gateway of india and I spent atleast half in hour of quiet morning time gazing out at the sea with a cup of chai in hand.   OK, now away from the nostalgia. The hotel has beefed up its security and you have to"
execllent service for business confences in the conjested city like mumbai
I had been associated with this hotel several times in connection with arranging accommodations for various business clients and meetings. I had also occasion to stay there a couple of times and experienced first hand the comforts of this five star deluxe hotel. This is a prestigious hotel in Bombay close to the famous Gateway of India. The Hotel has a new structure called Taj Tower built on modern lines but the old Taj (known as Heritage Wing) is an architectural beauty by itself. The rooms in the old Taj were of varying sizes and some times it posed problems for us when dignitaries started complaining that the other person got a bigger room. Luggage shifting to the rooms was not very prompt as the dignitaries reached their rooms but the luggages were slow to arrive. Some of
great experience we may visit again
"Hi There,  Wanted to share my experience at the Taj Palace and Tower.  I was booked at the Palace and must say there is only one word that describes the treatment here.  ROYALTY.  I was there for my honeymoon and was extremely satisfied with the complete experience I had.  I have stayed at other 5-star hotels in different countries from Europe, to North America and the Middle east and this by far stood out as an exceptional quality of service.    The view is priceless especially when you wake up in the morning and see the bay area during the early morning sunrise.    The staff are very friendly and courteious as well and they really do cater to you in a personal way from the very moment you step inside the doors to check in until you sit back in your vehicle to depart.    Will"
"About 3 months ago, I had to have a very quick trip to Mumbai for Business and was looking for a decent place to stay. The one which came up as a recomendation from everyone was the Taj. A great place just opposite the gate way of India. Wow, that was just opposite the sea. Plus being in the heart of south mumbai, we had some great connections. nariman point the business area was just a few miles away.   Plus Taxi's are very cheap in Mumbai so had great comfort in travelling too"
"Very good hotel, right next to the Gateway of India, with excellent facilities and amenities. Location is very convenient as its right next to  some very good restaurants (both local and intl) and shopping places. Good value for money"
"Must visit once atleast in your lifetime. I went after the 26/11 attacks. It was shut down for a month or so but it is back with a bang...... the way the hotel has been renovated, one will not notice the set back it had faced...  Excellent in all categories, with one of the worlds best art and decor. And the food to die for.  They take care of you as though you are a family."
"The Taj is really the epitome of a perfect hotel. I cant begin to describe the class that comes along with this hotel. I have never been so impressed before. It just had something about it. The location is the best in the entire city, the restaurants are legendary, the rooms are overly luxurious & the staff is better than you could ever ask for."
"The Taj was indeed a splendid one for spending quality time with family. I and my family was too excited and were wondering how the services would be, but frankly speaking the Taj didnt depress me even 1%.  Services/People/Environment everythign was excellent.  Best of Luck to the Taj for keeping the spirit so high."
1. Friendly and warm staff 2. Hotel makes a good comeback after the Terrorist Attacks- in a short and commendable time frame 3. I do miss my favourite restaurants  4. Many nostalgic memories
one of the finest and most classy hotels in mumbai. very well equiped and located in new bombay which is the place to be. right opposite the gateway of india.
the ambience at the hotel is great and people are very generous and kind still after the destruction of 26/11 the hotel has maitained it'scharm
"Live in the oldest of hotels which has kept up with the times.  High celings. Huge rooms and bathrooms. Outstanding service.  A silent witness to the times of Mumbai and India.  The coffee shop, Chinese and Middle easteen restaurants are fabulous.  There is always something happening in and around the hotel."
"the place is very nice... very overpriced, but location is brilliant...   the crowd is of course a bunch of old soddy snobs! and the business types...   i was there on business too... didn't mind the place at all... but next time, make mine a local joint, rather than an international standard place... no fun in that!"
"It was very nice experience to stay in Taj for 3 days with sea facing room. It was royal experience with very good hospitality from hotel staff. Very good buffet, Gym, Swimming pool........and everything was of high quality...........Will Love to stay again........."
"If there is any place better than this then it would be heaven. This hotel is truely marvellous. The facilities are excellent. There is nothing for me to write, you can go and experience it all by yourself. The food was mmmm excellent. It had variety, taste and was healthy. All the delicacies were amazing and there is little to choose between them. Over 21 days, I tried to taste most of the dishes but given a choice i would love to go there again. Hygeine and confort were excellent as well.  Post terrorist attacks, I hope the hotel hasn't lost its charm. I was really very sad to see the terrorist attacking the 'Heaven on earth' kinda hotel.  In the end , I will say experience Taj before you die :)"
"if you are to describe the place in one word.. it would be.. BEAUTIFUL!  the Taj Mahal Palace is decorated with beautiful collectibles that have the old world charm in them. all the rooms are done to retain the heritage of Mumbai, while providing all the modern facilities. the entrance to the Palace is by a huge staircase which offers you a red carpet welcome. Over the past century, The Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Mumbai has amassed a diverse collection of paintings and works of art and is a veritable showcase of artifacts and art of the era. From Belgian chandeliers to Goan Christian artifacts, the hotel incorporates a myriad of artistic styles and tastes. the place is a must visit!  the Japanese restaurant and Zouk serve great food..so does Masala Kitchen"
"Sightseeing in Mumbai isn't exactly a purely leisurely pursuit - it's a full on riot of colours, smells, people, taxis and a thousand an one other assaults on the senses. Yet, it's fun and the city's incredible. First-time visitors could do far worse than staying in the Taj Mahal Palace, preferrably in the Palace-Wing - it's a haven you will come to value after a day out & about. The service was impecable, from the welcome at the airport right to check-out. The only reason I did not rate it 5 is because of the final departure experience when, after having paid our bill, we were essentially left to find our driver in the chaos outside the hotel. Precisely because the service was otherwise faultless, this stuck out a bit. Our room was very large, large bathroom, too. The view from"
"I have checked in at this hotel on three or four occasions during the last two months and have enjoyed each stay. This is truly a great hotel and its not surprising that seasoned travelers consider it one of the best in the world.   The rooms are spacious and well furnished.   From  check in till checkout you are looked after very well. The staff are unfailingly courteous, friendly and efficient . The only two restaurants I have dined at , Masalakraft and Shamiana , have excellent menus and the recently reopened Sea Lounge is a classy place to sip a cup of tea. Reports on the other  restaurants are also excellent.  The location is good and if you get a sea view room, you get a great view of the Gateway of India. Colaba Causeway, with its shops and eating (and drinking) places"
"My husband and I had the great pleasure of staying at the Taj Mahal in early May for one night (unfortunately it was ONLY one night).     We were fortunate in that we booked the reservation thru a Virtuoso-affiliated travel agent and we were therefore treated like royalty.     Oh my!     We were greeted by a lovely young woman who escorted us right to our room on the 8th floor (in the new building; the old section isn't yet renovated) and took care of check-in right there, along with introducing us to our personal butler.       Apart from our ""special"" treatment, I suspect that the service, etc. for even mere mortals at this hotel is pretty terrific.     Our room (large) looked out on the Gateway of India.   We had to alter a flight reservation with Emirates thru the hotel's"
"The hotel comprises of two sections Palace and Tower.  I stayed in Tower. I had a special business meeting in the Conference hall and evening get together in the exclusive Restaurant/Bar facing the magnificent Gateway of India in the Palace.  This hotel provides superb service and hospitality. The attitude is always positive and they very clearly are amongst the best if not the best in this line.  The hotel is very well located - next to the gateway of India, allowing easy access into both the touristy Colaba area as well as to the business district.  Unfortunate incident happened on 26/12, but I am sure this hotel has already started to get its original charm back.  Next time whenever I will be in Mumbai I will definitely be staying with Taj specially considering my Taj Inner"
- Unblievable food quality and choice. The best in town. - Incomparable location. Bang opposite Gateway of India - Superlative service.
From the view of a 13 year old. We stayed here for 3 nights visiting relatives in Mumbai.  I am 1 of 4 kids in a family of 6 and this was a perfect location for us.  My mothers uncle was 5 minutes away and other relative ranged from 5 to 40 minutes away (most of them being close).  We arrived from the airport at 8:30 and had to go through numerous security checks (walk throughs and baggage checks).  Every time you enter the hotel you have to put all your baggage through a security machine and walk through to machines.  The lobby is very big and quite nice.  We checked in and walked up to our room.  The terrorists attacks were the reason for all the new security machines and guards in every hallway and toilet etc.  The rooms were so so.  They were not very modern but they were
The interior of the hotel is good but the serveice of the workers not not so good. But it is a nice place to spend 2- 3 days.
"The best view of sea from the hotel ..one of the best architecture,, most modern facilities and very polite and caring staffs..nd luxury . one of te best in Mumbai..."
"Went to Taj Mahal Palace Tower in May 2008 for Business Purposes. Sight seeing is very good especially from the Top Floor as you can have the full view of the Arabian Sea.  Secondly if plan for any conference, the hall at the first floor is awesum with high dignity culture and location.  From Business Perspective, one of the best place to have meetings and conferences."
"This hotel provides superb service and hospitality.  The attitude is always positive and they very clearly are amongst the best if not the best in this line. The hotel is very well located - next to the gateway of India, allowing easy acess into both the touristy colaba area as well as to the business district. The break fast spread at the coffee shop  is huge - a good variety - and you do get the option of being served on your table directly. For an early morning walk, i found the area outside the hotel great..along the seaside - lots of walkers there, but little traffic early morning. Bottomline is that this hotel is one of the best i have ever stayed in...and they provide lots of the little touches which makes them stand apart from other good hotels i have stayed in."
"We stayed here one night before visiting Elephanta and it was a marvelous evening, the hotel is amazing, the staff and service more everything you could expect in such a lovely hotel. we all wished we had more time to stay and relax here and will definately be going back again"
Amazed by the heritage structure and the palace building. Really liked the sea view from the rooms. Excellent location on the Gateway of India and quite close to all the places of leisure and business activity. I liked shopping at the nearby Colaba market and at some antique shops.
"The ambiance, the food, the view from the hotel are truly historic and will always cherish those moments."
"While sadness has surrounded this place for the last few months, believe me when it is back up and running you will experience nirvana and the finest not just from Mumbai, India but the world has to offer.  This hotel isnt a hotel it's your palace and no words can describe the magic and the aura you get when you live here.  The restaurants, Shopping arcade (Louis Vuitton, Zegna etc) The club, And Zodiac grill and the staff and the men who greet you at the entrance...  Just live here stop reading.."
"Great location and great food. Nothing can beat the location of this hotel. It might be slightly pricey, but if you factor in the money you would save on taxis and car rentals, nothing beats this hotel. On top of that you get bragging rights after staying at this one!  Absolutely loved every aspect of the hotel. Great food, the restaurants had great views of the sea. There was shopping (all kinds of and in all price ranges) right behind the hotel.  The location is great for a business traveler and a tourist.  2 thumbs up!"
The Taj was one of the best hotels I stayed in Mumbai. It was very excellent. It was first class. I loved how they treated us well.
"stayed here for a 6-week stint upon arriving in India for work - within a couple of days, all the attendants knew my name, my preferences, my favourite food etc - e.g. they would send me fruit, or a sweet paan, or a music cd, free of charge! they also upgraded me for the last 3 days of my stay...fantastic experience and i hope they can restore it back to its former glory after the attacks"
"As an Innercircle member, I got an invite for one night's stay with mywife, which I ladly accepted first of all to check whether the old grandeur of the Taj has been fully restored after the nightmarish 26th November attack by the Lashkar terrorists.   The check in was very smooth as usual. The only thing is that the security had vastly improved. Luggage was scanned in front of the entrance and mobile phones were thorughly checked. As usual I got an upgrade to the sea-facing room in the fourth floor. The view was great as the front side of the hotel was thronged by low-life visitors, who would never get to enter the Taj, but still thaink that the Taj hotel is their heritage. No visit to Mumbai is complete unless one gets to gawk at the ornate towers of Taj.   The lunch at the"
One of the best hotel in Mumbai facing the sea
"It was our two nights honeymoon stay in the heritage wing....explicit, unforgettable! The room was on the second floor facing the sea, a bearthtaking view! The food was served in the room, hot & ful was good taste as expected! We were taken very good care of as we required privacy no one disturbed us, came only when asked for. Complete honeymoon destination!"
"Booked hotel through expedia.com who had the best offer, but note that price might be low but without breakfast, that cost extra. Took a local cap from the airport via pre-paid voucer that they sell there. Takes abt. 35 min. to 1 hrs 15 min. depending on when during the day  - since traffic is pretty bad at peak hrs. Please note that local cap might be cheap but no aircon and no seatbelt. Might be worth checking out before fir Hotel pick-up if you are a biz traveler or no problem paying a bit extra.  I had a basic room, which was ok - in the Tower. The palace part of the Taj Mahal is under reconstruction, after the incident a few months ago in Mumbai. It pretty well located and in distance to the biz area of Mumbai - at lease if you are in shipping. Room simple, not newest"
"We were whisked seamlessly from the airport to the hotel. On arrival people were waiting at the door to greet us by name and take us to our room to check in. Coffee arrived while we were still doing the paper work, my laundry was taken away with the at the same time (we were travelling around India) only to reappear before dinner layered in a wicker basket interleaved with little fragrance sachets. This typified our stay here, rarely have I experienced such kind and efficient treatment in any hotel. We only ate either around the pool or in Masala Kraft or the Souk during our stay but in where ever the food was delicious and again the staff were charming. I have found it difficult to submit any thing on Trip Advisor about this wonderful hotel as we left on the 25th November 2008"
Was so saddened about the news of the attacks on this hotel. We stayed here back in Oct 07. A hotel with true old world charm - the service was truly impeccable (except for telling us we would only need 1/2 hr to get to airport haha now that was a nervous taxi ride). The breakfast was a feast of Indian and Western delicacies and the service at breakfast was probably the best I have had at any restaurant anywhere. The concierge was great in getting us last minute tickets to the aus/indian cricket match and as an extra bonus both teams were staying at the hotel (can u tell Im a cricket fan). Lastly what a lovely pool area - again highlighting the old world charm. We unfortunately stayed in the new tower but the room was very spacious if a little dated.
"I recently stayed at this hotel and was really impressed with all aspects.  Above all, the staff were superb.  I was particularly impressed with Birgit Zorniger (Deputy General manager) and Guneeta Duggal (Asst Sales Manager) who both really excelled in their respective roles and made my visit an extraordinary one.  The hotel was one of the main venues attacked by the recent terrorist attack.  One would never know, due mainly to the excellent way the hotel is run by these professionals.  I was really impressed and will definitely return."
"It's quite remarkable how quickly the Taj has got back on it's feet after the terrorist attack in November. There are no signs of any damage and most of the ground floor is open with the exception of one bar and the Chinese restaurant. The Heritage wing rooms are currently closed so one stays in the Tower. I had a fairly spacious room on the 14th floor with an old style small bathroom. No complaints because everything was spotlessly clean and I slept very well. Staff are welcoming, very polite and helpful. For me this still remains one of my favourite hotels because of the outside pool area. Apart from the very large pool there is also an area to take drinks, eat or just relax all away from air conditioning ! In addition if you are concerned about staying here then the security"
"After having to cancel this hotel due to the terror attack I decided to rebook for business at this hotel and so glad I did. Currently the main building is being rebuilt but the Towers are used to house guests. Everything about my exprerience here was top notch. Excellent room , immaculate and clean through out. Nothing was too much trouble for the extremely attentive and professional staff who will pull all the stops out to assist you with everything from finding local shops, advise on taxi prices and nearest Synagogue. I would love to come back another time and highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to the area. Its conveniently located and if you dont mind a bit of rubble outside the hotel, this is the place for you"
"The palace wing was closed due to the recent terrorist attacks; the Tower wing is nice but with limited charm. The rooms are really cosy but relatively small. The pool/ garden is fantastic, we can regret that the breakfast is served indoor in a confortable but boring coffee shop."
"My stay of course preceded the very sad events of Nov. 2008 but I would not hesitate to stay there again and highly recommend the hotel. It was very expensive and more than we would normally spend but the quality of the hotel, the location and view makes it worthwhile. Our room was quite large and was located in the tower overlooking the Gateway to India and waterfront. We saw the sun coming up over the Gateway each morning from our room. I don't know what the rooms are like that don't face the Gateway. The ferries to Elephanta Island and others and the Gateway are right across the street from the hotel and only a minute walk.  We were there three nights and there is so much to see and do in the immediate area and all within walking distance. We walked to restaurants at night"
"Great hotel, very helpful staff and high standards. Expensive when compared to similar accommodation worldwide but fairly typical for this area of Mumbai. I arrived at 4 AM and was met by a full reception committee and escorted to my room; this was appreciated after a long flight in. room a bit small but very comfortable and with a great view of the gateway to india.."
"Stayed there with family from 27-31 December 2008. Nice to be back again and good to see things starting to buzz again albeit a bit quietly.  Received a warm welcome from reception staff at early hour of arrival. As usual a splendid 5-star hotel. The class shows everywhere. We were in the 15th floor sea-facing deluxe rooms. However, the following could be improved:  a) Room walls painted unsympathetically in dull grey colour (navy ship grey) including all wooden cabinet work / wall cornice mouldings which were once nicely polished natural wood finishes. Somebody's gone paint-brush crazy and ruined a once very fine decor into a bland looking finish. There is also a problem with colour coordination in the room: grey wall, beige floor carpet, light green curtains and odd coloured"
It is wonderful Stay..Taj stands as leader in the hospitality sector with mix of Indian Culture & modern trend...The food is worldclass...
"I absolutely loved the Taj Mahal Palace, except for one thing that might be more of an issue with the city of Mumbai rather than the hotel itself: the street noise. My room had a fantastic view of the Arabian Sea and the Gateway of India, as well as the very noisy street below. We could hear cars honking below us way into the night, which did not help us battle jet lag. Other than that, the hotel was magnificent and the concierge service was impeccable. Complimentary breakfast at the Sea Lounge was also great. I wasn't blown away by their spa services, but having tea by the pool was just as relaxing. Had we not been so tired from our travels, we(I & family) may have been awake long enough to enjoy the restaurants in the hotel."
"The stay was arranged by my company, then Wipro Technologies.  There was a seminar for which a one day stay had been arranged.  The experience of room, food, hospitality was so exotic that one would never forget it in his/her life.  That was the day, I realized, that why TAJ is preferred location for most high profile and business magnets of today. Not much to detail about since our entire day was spent in the seminar and then, we had to had over our rooms. It is very bad that a bunch of young boys terrorised a country of a 1 billion population.  I wish all the staff of Taj, my best wishes for the times to come."
"One of the worlds greatest hotels, now closed due a terror attack.  The staff are some of the best anywhere in the world, the accommodation and restaurants the Pride of India.  This hotel can never be put down, it will be restored and opened again to its full glory.  The customers of the Taj pledge support for this hotel and prey for the safety for the staff and guests present during the recent incident.  Posted a few photos of the hotel taken during a recent visit.   We support the Taj and will be back."
I went mumbai on a bussiness trip.I stayed in this hotel for 5 day and the ROYAL treatment I got there i'll not forget taht entire my life.Its like heaven not an hotel.
The Taj hotel chain has consistently good hotels and the Mumbai flagship is very good. As with all Indian hotels I think that it overdoes the service. I would rather make my own first coffee in the hotel rather than order room service and deal with staff. The Taj grounds and pool are great. There is even a very state of the art 24 hour gym facility. Restaurants in the hotel were very good but not spectacular. The location is excellent for access to South Mumbai sights. In Mumbai this is the only hotel to stay in if the price doesn't put you off.
"The hotel has an overall style and ambience which is haute. The most expensive and exclusive restaurant in the city, Zodiac Grill is located here. Excellent restaurants for Indian (Masala Craft) & Lebanese Cuisine. Coffee Shop needs a lot of revamping..not the best amongst the hotels which I have stayed in.   Room service is prompt. Food is desirable. Staff (still) have genuine smiles and not the made up plastic masks!  Locationwise, the classiest location in the whole city...one could not have asked for more."
"This hotel is well reviewed, so I will just add that I got a great weekend deal in the Tower wing, city view for INR 11,000 (USD 220) incuding all tax etc. by booking last minute.  This was only marginally more than some mid-range hotels."
"This is a world-famous and world-class hotel. The rooms are everything you'd expect in a five-star property. The food served is arguably the best of any restaurant in India (and far surpasses the cuisine in the Taj hotels in Delhi). The staff are well-trained and efficient and do their best even when overwhelmed with hotel guests and sight-seers.   I especially recommend the Zodiac restaurant. I don't think I've had a better meal for Continental cuisine in Asia, outside Japan. Hats off to chef Hemant Oberoi.   The only trouble I had prior to checkout was a bit of trouble with the wi-fi internet. Speed was very good, but I frequently could not connect to such common sites as Yahoo and Google.   It was a nearly-perfect stay until check-out. That's when I noted a 9,000+ rupee"
"The Taj mahal has to be without doubt the best hotel in the city. I have stayed more than 5-6 times in the hotel and have never been disappointed.  The service is impeccable. The hotel has two wings (old and new) and having stayed in both i feel the old wing, even though more expensive is worth the extra dollar.   The rooms have been tastefully done and the bathrooms are big marble with all the features.   The beds are comfortable. The resturants in the hotel have to be one of the best around the world. the golden dragon and wasabi are the best chinese and japnese restaurents i have eaten in.  The restaurent on the roof top (souq) has the most amazing view in bombay and the food is also not bad.  overall without douby one of the best hotels in india."
"I stayed at the Taj for 3 months during a client project and got to know the place and the staff very well. Overall it's a great place to be - very comfortable rooms, fantastic pool and facilities and a range of restaurants to eat in. The staff go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible and staying in Colaba is a (relative) breath of fresh air compared with the rest of the city. The only downside is the rooms in the tower felt a little dated without the charm of colonial times that you get in the palace. If you want something a little more modern, try the Intercontinental on Marine Drive"
"We stayed here on our last night in India.  The Palace is definitely more impressive-looking than the Tower, which is where we stayed in a deluxe room.   The room was fine if a little bit tired (chipped bath, worn towels/bathrobes) but we were hardly in the room except to sleep so we were not too bothered.   We ate in the Shamiana Restaurant which was not cheap by Indian standards but the quality and portion-sizes were excellent, so no complaints there.  The best thing about the hotel from our point of view was its location: with very little time to spend in the city, it is well-situated to walk out and do a quick bit of sightseeing (high court, university, Prince of Wales museum and, of course, the Gateway of India).  Be prepared to be hassled by sellers of all sorts of rubbish"
"This hotel is a jewel.  Fabulous public spaces, great service, nice mix of restaurants.  Definitely stay in the old wing.  The garden and pool are a real oasis in the midst of Mumbai.  We're pretty demanding travelers and this is a GREAT hotel.  Good gym too."
"We arrived in the Taj Palace after spending 24 hours on an overnight train from Agra. Somewhat tired and ragged we were still taking in the view of the harbour and the Gateway of India when our taxi pulled into the Taj Palace and Towers.  We were too early to check into our room (city view in the Towers), so we were offered a complimentary breakfast for the trouble of waiting 45 minutes (this was not included in our package).   The hotel has everything we expected. Modern bars and dining areas, beautiful lobby and some top class restaurants. The view from the older Taj Mahal Palace is fantastic and teh staircase has to be seen to be believed!   Overall, the service in the hotel we found to be excellent, from the wait staff, to the bars and restaurants. I would definitely stay"
"Ever since staying at the Taj three weeks ago, I have been dying to return home and get 'revenge' on the hotel for its absolutely outrageous prices by giving it a mere FOUR stars instead of the full five... but alas, I just don't have the heart to do so! While we were completely raked over the coals for our two-night stay, I absolutely loved each and every aspect of this amazing hotel and I guess, in the end, I don't regret having shelled out the dough for a single moment! It is one of those memories of a lifetime. Plus, we absolutely loved Mumbai, which was a pleasant surprise, after having heard such terrible things about it.  Maybe the Taj could give some slight low season specials or something, since the hotel did seem practically empty (they allege that they charge 'market"
"Just back from a stay at the Taj Mahal and what an experience! We had rooms in both the Palace (pool facing) and the Tower (Deluxe 15th Floor).  The Palace rooms were OK, but smelt rather 'musty' whereas my room in the Tower was fantastic!  Skyline views over the city and harbour and even an enclosed balcony.  Thought my room wouldn't be on a par with the Palace itself - but it was.  The hotel is stunning, and the service throughout impeccable.  The Restaurants, particularly the Souk were something to be remembered!  Come with a thick wallet, enjoy the luxury and be treated like royalty the whole time.  Highly, highly recommended."
"We booked the Tower part of the hotel at the end of our travels in india during which we had mainly used budget hotels. We hoped that a treat at the Tower would make our stay in Mumbai all the more enjoyable and offer a relaxing end to the experience.  The main lobby part of the hotel is incredibly impressive without a doubt but we were sorely disappointed. True, we came into the hotel with pack backs and looking a bit dusty, but the customer service was absolutely chillingly frosty from the moment we stepped in to the moment we left. We have stayed in some excellent hotels in Asia, but this was worse than budget hotels anywhere else we have been. It was even stranger since we the rooms were still expensive even if not as expensive as the palace (well £200 per night) and yet we"
We stayed at the club floor in the Taj Mahal building and really enjoyed the very nice room overlooking the Gate of India.  The rooms are very nice and up to what you would expect of a 5 start Hotel room. The Butler service offered worked very well and the Butler was present when you needed him.  The building itself is a must seen if you are in Bombay. The experience of staying in this palace is something special which makes a big difference to many other very good hotels. Service was very good and I can recommend it. If you like the “Old school” style with a supreme service it is a must.
"It's good but for the prices charged it should be. Booked 4 rooms for myself and friends for 5 day stay.The first thing to say is, yes it's very expensive, not just the room rates but prices in restaurants and bars are very inflated. Go outside and you can get a great 3 course dinner and a drink for the price of a starter in the hotel. However the service is very good and the public areas are very pleasant although a little too warm during our stay. Watch out for the price of drinks from the room minibar, they are outrageous. I succumbed on my last day, without checking the price, 2 mini vodkas and a can coke= $48!"
"This very historic property blew us away when we first arrived. We were upgraded to the Heritage wing (which is the old part of the Hotel renovated to modern day standards with the touch or yesteryear and history that is totally appropriate). My first room was 354 and the second one was 330 (I came back the following week).  Again, the service was certainly 5 star plus and the check in process swift and very respectful.  WARNING – your credit card will be pre-billed for the full amount of your stay – the Hotel does not tell you this which meant that I was transferring money around to “stay alive” in a different time zone than my bank. This is very poor practice and I subsequently escalated this issue with the management who insist that it is standard practice for that property."
"What a magnificent place! It has the style and gradeur of the Victorian period, in which it was build. The pool side area is a fantastic relaxing area where the small snacks never seize to amaze. Fresh fresh fresh, no compromises. I can imagine that the Oberoy or Four Seasons appeals more to business men as the amenities in the hotel are good, but maybe not the very latest. What one gets in return is incredible. The staff is excellent en only aimed and one thing: making us feel comfortable. I do not understand at all how other writers found the service at the poolside not good.  I will certainly stay here again!"
"I stayed in the tower part of the hotel in May 08.  The check in was very efficient. Service was outstanding. The room itself was okay but the tv playing the hotel's own promotional video was somewhat pretentious in my opinion. That said, watching the video gives an insight of this hotel's heritage and history. The more impressive facade of the hotel is to the rear of the building and legend has it that it was built back to front. The main entrance now faces the 'Gateway of India' but the much grander facade overlooks the outdoor pool area to the rear of the building.  Many famous people have stayed at this hotel, including Lord Louis Mountbatten on his last day as Viceroy of India before India's independence in 1948. John and Yoko also had a 'happening' at this hotel.  In terms"
"My partner and I always stay at this hotel when we arrive in Mumbai.  This time we were travelling with our 15 month old baby.  Generally this is an excellent hotel.  Worth upgrading to the club rooms as you get a private breakfast room and a very spacious room/suite.  The pool is the highlight set in a beautiful courtyard.  The Tandoor Prawns from the inhouse indian restaurant are the best we ever ate, apparently caught only 3 hours before in the 1st of two catches of the day.  Have stayed here 4 times now and the only criticism I have are the staff at the pool side restuarant and the pool.  They never fail to amaze me how little they do yet seem to look so serious.  Seems more time is spent training them than putting them to work.  Get a reputation for tipping or complaining"
"This place is very high end and an amazing hotel.  It is located right on the water and has beautiful views.  The staff are extremely professional and helpful.  They easily assisted with booking tours and exchanging currency.    The hotel offers many different restaurants.  The food was delicious, a bit pricey but tasted great.    The pool was comfortable and the staff there was helpful.  There is a restaurant by the pool so it's easy to get food while you're there.  The rooms were comfortable and clean.  The spa was great and I had a fabulous massage there.  This was a very pampered experience!"
"Per other reviews here, we booked a waterfront view room in Palace building...a great choice. The room was a little dated, but otherwise excellent, comfortable and large. Service staff was very attentive and restaurants were great. Breakfast by the pool is not to be missed.  Within a couple of easy walking blocks is Indigo restaurant, recommended by the concierge. Try the roof top seating...outstanding food and ambience.  Boats to Elephanta Island depart across the street from the hotel and going there is worth the one hour trip...just choose one of the bigger boats if you want to stay dry."
"Having only a short time in Mumbai before moving on to other travels, it was important to us to grab what we could of ""the real India"".  We really didn't want to spend our 36 hours in a bland International environment by staying in an airport hotel.  As soon as we arrived, we were taken right back to our previous visit some years ago and appreciated the calm, quiet service, the fact that the concierge and bellhops knew us by name almost instantly and the unmistakably Indian atmosphere.  It took us 2 hours to get here from the airport, during which time we were able to ""acclimatise"" and the cool lobby was peaceful - not always the case when a large tour group is passing through, or at particularly busy times of the day when it's hard to find a seat.  We ate at the Indian"
"Having just had my 30th birthday and to kick start my first trip to India I decided to splash out on a a night at the Taj. The entrance blew me away and I did feel slightly under-dressed as I arrived in my flip flops, shorts and backpack - especially as my taxi was just about held together by rust! The staff were very polite and lucky enouh to get an upgrade to a suite in the more impressive palace end of the hotel.  The room was slightly dissapointing and the view not as good as the Lonely Planet suggested, even though I was over looking the Gatway to India.  All in all it felt way over-priced to me so having spent best part of £200 on one night I retreated to the clean and simple bentley guest house @ £8 per night.  If you have silly amount of money stay there, if you don't"
"It's interesting reading the previous reviews here, since they pretty much sum up how I feel about this hotel. On the positive side, it's a beautiful building with a great history. Our room was large and clean with nice view of the sea, a steam facility in the shower and a big plasma tv. The public rooms are immaculate and I liked that there was a reserved bar and seating area for hotel guests. We also tried out a couple of the bars and restaurants, and whilst not amazing, the food was very enjoyable. The staff are also worth mentioning since they were very friendly and professional.  On the negative side I thought the pool furniture was rubbish (cloth sunbeds and seats?!?) and there wasn't enough space. This is also a seriously expensive hotel, which considering you're in"
"Stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip. Had room in heritage wing - very nice, not at all impersonal like some of the chain hotels in India in this price range. Superb location for tourism and also in downtown office district (note travel in Mumbai is very slow - easily over 90 mins from airport to downtown, so location is very important regardless of where you stay). Breakfast by the pool was very nice. Service friendly but occasionally clueless.  Note prices in this hotel appear to vary widely. The corporate rate I received was well under half what is mentioned by some other reviewers. Bottom line: memorable for location and atmosphere. Probably safer bets if what you want is a safely luxurious respite from hustle and bustle."
"We stayed for 3 nights at the Tower part of the Taj in South Bombay at the end of our Dehli-Agra-Rajasthan-tour and to celebrate my birthday - and we loved it all! Our room was facing the city, but I still liked the view and the fact that you could step out to the tiny balcony (though we couldn't take good pictures due to the mosquito net). Everything seemed to be looked after really well. The staff was really friendly, helpful and well informed, and the hotel surprised me with a yummy birthday cake. As I love Indian food, and though we were spoiled by all the good restaurants we tried on our tour, the Indian restaurant in the Taj's heritage wing was by far the best. The hotel bar felt like straight out of an early 90es Hindi movie, especially when a Korean girl sang bar tunes"
"This is a ludicrously overpriced hotel; another example of Indian hotels levying western five star tariffs but failing to deliver at the standard. The delicate Victorian grandeur of the Palace Wing is negated by the mediocrity of the rooms, service and food. At these prices a hotel should be flawless (or close to it) but the Taj struggles. The required attention to detail isn't there."
"We stayed here for a couple of nights at the end of our honeymoon and were really disappointed.  We stayed in the Palace part in a Luxury sea facing room but it stank of damp and stale cigarettes and was desparately in need of refurbishment.  It was also on the main road overlooking the Gateway of India which was incredibly noisy at all times of the day and night.  We asked to move but the upgraded room we were shown on the Taj Club floor was even more worn and tatty than the room we had so we stuck it out in the original room.  The carpets were frayed and the joinery was badly chipped and damaged.  You also get lots of noise coming from the corridors and atrium.  During our stay, there was extensive building work taking place on the roof so it was even more noisy during the day"
"Stayed in the Taj Mahal Tower for two weeks in March. Even with a promo rate this was EUR 240 + 20% tax, breakfast included. The rooms in the Tower (built 1970s) are old and tired, with a very dated bathroom, CRT TV, no DVD player/CD player/ alarm clock radio/IPod dock etc. The windows are single glazed and the balcony doors, as far as I could see, were all broken, so that noise from the outside came in at all times. However the heritage part was smart and I heard that the rooms had been refurbished recently. Pros: - good breakfast (better in the Sea Lounge) - excellent pool - good food at Marsala Kraft and Souk - good location by the Gateway to India - wireless internet in rooms (although 5000 INR for 15 days) Cons: - service became increasingly poor as the stay went on, such"
"We recently stayed at the Taj Palace for two nights at the start of a three week holiday. The palace part of the hotel is great but as with most things in India it’s a bit rough around the edges and lacks some attention to detail. You would expect better considering it is one of Mumbai’s best hotels.  Our room was good but defiantly not worth the price tag of Rs 25,000 per night. It was classified as a ‘city view’ which in reality meant looking onto the void between the Palace and the Tower. The décor was looking rather tired and the room smelt of damp which we think was to do with the air con. The worst bit was the balcony which was totally covered with pigeon droppings. We requested to move rooms but apparently the hotel was full. Needless to say as the view was so uninspiring"
"The old building has beautiful public spaces.  Our suite, Clock Tower Suite, is in need of refurbishment. Same with the double room next door. The suite has strange A/C. I had to call to butler who called engineering to adjust temperature. There is no control panel inside the room. There is only one speed in the A/C and that is high. The tower is like any Sheraton or Marriott. Reputation is higher than reality."
"We had a family meal at the ""Souk"" recently. The Family loves middle eastern food, lebanese food, turkish food...you get the drift! We have had some great middle eastern meals on travels across the world but unfortunately our experiences with restaurants in India was not too encouraging! Untill we revisited Souk.  The restaurant has a great location at the topmost floor of the Taj Mahal hotel in ombay overlooking the Gateway of India. The decor is Okay (not my glass of arrack) but the location more than makes up for flaming orange tiles and over efficient airconditioning! We ordered our appetisers and boy were we blown away! The food was fantastic. The colours, tastes , textures and flavours were simply fantastic. The main courses were equally fantastic. Service at the Taj has"
"My husband and I had great expectations when we stayed for 4 nights recently with our 8 month old baby. We are big fans of Taj hotels (except the Sydney version) and had long hoped to stay here. I have stayed several times in The Land's End Taj and believe it to be superior in every respect.  This hotel is tired and desperately needs new bathrooms and furnishings.  The restaurants are overpriced and, as noted by other reviewers, not a patch on those nearby. We paid over US$120 for 2 toasted sandwiches and a couple of drinks, which were nothing special. We were actually denied access to all of the restaurants because of our baby, which we found faintly ridiculous.  I have found the staff  at other Taj hotels very obliging and polite, but cant say the same for this one, supposedly"
"for the chaotic infrastructure that Mumbai (and elsewhere in India) has, this hotel is pretty good in terms of Indian hotel standards. It's very conscious of its heritage but in nooks and crannies you see cracks and lop-sided doors, broken windows etc..  However, for the business traveller, this hotel is great for: fast internet lines, quick and prompt deliveries, 24-hour business center, generous refills of fruit and water in your room, efficient plumbing, decent water quality (!), an excellent bookshop and a great buffet breakfast (which is better taken inside in the restaurant because the pool/lounge area has these huge black birds who fly right up to your table and carry off your food!   Didn't get to stay in the old wing, but the new wing is good for the business traveller"
"I have stayed in 5 star hotels thorughout the world, and this was not up to par. The lobby is nice and happening, but the rooms need to be revamped. All the furniture needs to be upgraded. Old and worn.The carpet needs to be replaced asap. Once your are out of the lobby, it looks like a 3 star place.     The coffee shop in the lobby is outrageously priced for what is served, even by New York standards.       On top of that, I was told my exorbitant room price did not include breakfast!     I have stayed in better places in Mumbai."
"We arrived at The Taj late at night after a long flight from NYC. We got out of our car and walked with a daze into the lobby of the hotel. The next thing I knew, my bag had been taken from me and a beautiful young woman was showing me to the registration area for the old wing. that's the Taj Mahal Palace. The best service I have ever experienced and I've experience 5 stars all over the globe. They couldn't do enough including carrying my plate for breakfast from the buffet to our gorgeous table by the pool. Such pampering was great considering the heat and chaos of Mumbai which waited for us only a few feet outside these pearly gates. It's expensive, but worth it. Stay in the old wing if you can, but just stay here if you can. I could have stayed at the pool for the entire stay."
"We stayed in the old wing, which is incredible. However, the price of the room does raise the expectations to a good service. We stayed over a weekend, unfortunately the hotel was hosting a wedding at the same time.  They decided to throw a party until 12:30-1 am, which was heard over the whole hotel. My partner wasnt feeling very well and we were looking for a nice night in in our lush room... we contact the staff to see if they could turn the volume down but after more than 1hour waiting for an update we gave up on it....   We are great fans of Taj, but this is the 3rd time that we have a noise problem with them, I guess that providing a quiet time for their is not high on their priority list."
"One of the best hotels I have had the opportunity to stay at. Was here for business but the hotel made it feel like a holiday. Felt pampered and relaxed. Cannot recommend more highly. Note: try and stay in the old wing, its far more beautiful."
"Have just returned from two separate one week breaks at The Taj which in some ways were quite different.  I took the advice of many on Trip Advisor and booked Taj Club rooms in the Palace wing, and I’m very glad I did. This hotel is quite strange in its design in that it looks like the interior of a prison but is littered with art and sculpture – however, it never failed to interest me, and it was always interesting to walk around and view the art, and the whole buildings interior is wonderfully photogenic. I’ve been fortunate to stay in many hotels all over the world and I will state The Taj’s interior will always be remembered fondly.  In my first week I made the mistake of accepting the first room I was shown in the Palace wing – it was large and on the 6th floor and had a"
"I booked a sea view room in the Old Wing as a last hurrah after 3 weeks touring India. It was very expensive (2 nights here was as much as our week in Goa) and whilst we had a wonderful stay I do think it was a touch on the pricey side.  On arrival we were upgraded to a Taj Club room, perks of which included in room check in, drinks on arrival and wine and chocolates in the room. We also benefitted from complimentary breakfast and cocktail hour in the Taj Club room. The room itself was spacious with a good sized comfortable bed. The view was stunning and worth the extra money. The bathroom had a very deep bath and a rainfall shower which left me feeling the cleanest I have ever been! The Molton Brown toiletries were a nice touch.  The Old Wing is beautiful and you really feel"
"This is a great hotel, but probably its best feature is the restaurants. I don't think you will find better in India"
"Excellent hotel with great location for shopping and restaurants. We stayed in the Heritage wing and were upgraded to the Taj Club. Excellent service, staff try very hard."
"I am an attorney, and I needed to take several depositions of employees of an Indian company over the course of a week for one of my cases.  I cannot thank God enough that the Taj existed for this hectic business trip.  As a preliminary matter, I had never been to Mumbai before.  I can now report that it makes New York look like Des Moines.  The crowds, the noise, the press of people, the acrid air pollution, and abject poverty are jarring.  While I am sure that Mumbai offers great cultural experiences for those who are patient and have the time to find them, I was constrained by the pressures of a business trip and the 12-hour time change.  I was picked up from the airport in a nice car by one of the hotel staff.  This service is well worth it.  Call the hotel in advance and"
"I stayed there for a couple of nights on a business trip. First thing to say go somewhere else if you are looking for value for money. The price I paid for the room has been the highest I have ever paid, humble me, and the hotel wasn't certainly the best I have ever been. It scarcely gets to the top 10. This does not mean the hotel is a bad one, at all, it just mean that if you care about what you are paying for you will probably find a better deal for the same quality standards. If you company is paying for or/and you do not care at all about money and bills then you can go to the Taj. There is a nice swimming pool and the breakfast is a good one. They will even give you some complementary chocolates, what they will not give you is good internet connection, even if you are"
"4 night stay for New Year after Taj Exotica Goa (see previous review) As a Club room guest in the Palace this was one of the best hotel experiences ever ( if very expensive!) Met at the airport by fully uniformed chaufeur in a new Mercedes. On arrival the car door opened by your private uniformed butler who greets you by name and whisks you direct to room where he conducts formalities. Champagne waiting , enourmous room and white marble bathrooom with every possible requirment provided. Amazing building, location, pool, shops and restaurants. Service second to none. Some complaints however. As in Goa birds are a menace. If you have breakfast at the pool do not be suprised to have  a crow fly to the back of chair and then pounce on your toast. Pigeons were nesting above the main"
"I visited Mumbai while my partner was on business there and was delighted to be the opportunity to stay at this classic hotel in a stunning location by the Gateway to India. The service was almost perfect, not so intrusive that you dare not move, not so distant that you couldn't find what you wanted without feeling abandoned. The food was excellent and we felt well cared for.  For those who like architectural features, the palace wing with its glorious staircase and dome, exudes Italianate charm. My sense was that the hotel is to Mumbai as the Plaza Hotel, built a few years after the Taj, is to New York.   The seating by the pool is lovely for those who get chance to sit there, although it would be good to see a slightly greener policy on towel usage, the staff were, if"
"This is a landmark hotel, with ambiance that goes far beyond the comfort of it's accommodations. It's location, history and grandeur have to be considered when writing a review. Luckily, at least in my experience, the quality of the accommodations measured up. We stayed in a club level room on the 6th floor of the Palace, which was enormous and had many distinct touches. I doubt any two rooms are the same in this area. The marble hallways with central atrium were breathtaking. We had city/pool views, I guess a less expensive and desirable option than water/Gateway views, but impressive nonetheless. The only weak part of the room was the bathroom, small with some early mildew on some of the shower tile. However in a 100+ year old hotel, I'm willing to forgive. Bed very"
"Great hotel, good area in Mumbai, very good service and interior. Good choice of restaurants. Very good and fast internet access, decent business phone. European power converter in the room. Only complaint is that the windows leave to much noise into the room and on Indian streets there is a very loud honking noise until at least 2AM."
"After a long flight and dito transfer through Bombay around midnight, the rooms, the swimming pool, the reception and the atmosphere gives us a warm welcome.  I had a deluxe suite in The Tower. What a space, what a comfort, what a luxury and with veyr nice warm colours.  The swimming pool, surrounded by beds, tables etc, is great. Unfortunately no time to swim."
"I am a true Taj fan, but this hotel was a disapointment! It was really pricy and one hoped that being the oldest Taj, the grandeur would go with it. At 22,000 rupees a day, you get a matchbox to live in literally. The hotel is beautiful to look at but the rooms do not reflect it. Very ordinary decor, sad uninformed service, which is VERY unusual for  a Taj property.  The saying also goes that if you're not  a foreigner..do not waste your money on this hotel as it still is reeling under the impression of ""Raj"" days!  Doesn't do justice to its cost or reputation!"
"Stayed on the second floor of the palace, and to me it felt like staying in a boutique hotel.  After being in the room for an hour or so I thought it was the best hotel I had ever stayed in.  Smack in the middle of Bombay but so peaceful and relaxing.  The bathrooms were glorious, the room had everything you could wish for and the service was faultless. I must mention the restaurant Masala Kraft - big WOW for that.  It rates up there as one of the best restaurants I have ever been to, and that includes the service, food, decor, atmosphere.  It actually become hard to leave the hotel. The service could not have been more helpful and I really appreciate everything they did to help me enjoy my stay in Bombay.  Will definitely stay there again and enjoy a tea by the pool."
"I have just returned from a week's holiday in India. I flew into Mumbai and stayed at the Taj Palace & Tower for two nights, joining a friend who was already there.  The one thing to be said about the Taj is that the hospitality is unbeatable. If you are flying into Mumbai I would definitely recommend calling the Taj ahead of time and requesting a car transfer. Transfer to the hotel from the airport can take up to two hours (as there can be a lot of traffic) so it is very nice to have a private car take you to the hotel, equipped with newspapers, magazines, and most importantly bottled water.  If you have the money to spend, I would greatly recommend a room in the Palace versus the Tower (although both are lovely). As the Tower was built after the Palace, you have a better sense"
Great rooms with view on the Ocean. Fantastic service by a very friendly staff The decoration of the hotel makes you feel like you are staying in a mansion. Rooms temperature difficult to adjust and surprisingly long check-in if you happen to be upgraded. If you are looking for a restaurant... Try Trishna.  Great Indian seafood but make sure to reserve a table ahead of time.
"What a lovely hotel and what a position!. We had requested a sea view and had a really large room in the old building overlooking the sea and Gateway to India. We arrived very tired from London after a night in the plane and our welcome was great and the check-in seamless. We had a meal in the evening in the hotel's Indian cuisine restaurant and although expensive it was probably the tastiest food we had during our trip.  The position is great, too, and we were able to walk from the hotel to the wonderful old Victorian railway station and also to the cathedral and Horniman Square."
"We stayed in ""THE TAJ"" at the end of our India trip in Nov 2007.  The TAJ has a great history and is a fantastic hotel.  We had booked a pick up from the airport and the driver expected us already at the luggage belt way before the crowds. So the stay even started relaxed.  When we checked in we were upgraded to the TAJ club and had a suberb large room on the top floor.  The service is just excellent, as the staff immediately takes every issue/problem over until it is solved. (I refurned from the gym and met a receptionist in the lift - he looked at me and suggest a some cold drinks and ice send to the room.....!)  The atmosphere in the hotel is relaxed as well and there are plenty of good restaurants and bars available. My personal favourites are the Sea Lounge for breakfast"
"We stayed here last spring on the last leg of our month long journey through India. I will have to say this was one of our least favorite hotels in India  (besides the Fort Rajwada) This beautiful  hotel has all of the bells and whistles of a 5 star hotel, except for the service. We encountered horrible service at every turn, from reception, restaurants, housekeeping, and the concierge. (from a 2 hour wait for a new pillow to a 45 minute wait for a check in the restaurant) It was if we were invisible, we complained several times but to no avail. Finally upon checkout I let it be known that we had experienced horrible service and they acted surprised. In the end they did comp every meal and amenity we had used in the hotel (about $450) Overall we found the Taj group of hotels to"
"Stayed in the new wing (15th floor)  for 5 nights in November 2007. Overall I had a very average stay If you are willing to pay the sort of prices the hotel charges (I paid over $400 per night), I would recommend staying  the Oberoi, which in my opinion is a far nicer hotel.    Positives: Good facilities (lovely pool, lots of restaurants, spa, gym etc) Very friendly and efficient staff Location is good with great views of the Gateway of India  Negatives Rooms- Given that this is a five star hotel, the rooms (I stayed in the new wing) are very disappointing. They are small and have a very damp/musty smell (as indeed do the 15th and 16th floors). I had to move rooms after my first room had an interleading door which clearly wasnt soundproofed so could here my elderly Indian"
"We stayed in the Old Wing for 2 nights in November, 2007. We had come to Mumbai from Udaipur and had just stayed at the Oberoi Hotel, Udaivilas, while there which has just been rated the best hotel in the world and rightly so. So, of course, we were a little bit spoilt and it is hard to live up to the standards created by Udaivilas. All in all, I thought the Taj Mahal Palace hotel was beautiful. The Old Wing is a beautiful example of old world British colonial architecture and the decor is pretty. However, the room we were given was extremely musty and damp and the carpets were dirty. We asked to change rooms and the next room was not musty, thank Goodness, but still a bit damp with dirty carpets. The concierge is not as helpful as we would have hoped in setting up an itinerary"
I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times and it is absolutely beautiful. The old part is better and the breakfast area very pleasing.  My most recent stay was disappointing because I was not told that the entire floor above my room was being refurbished. The staff were not honest with me about this when I phoned to ask why there was banging late afternoon while I was trying to sleep. It took a very long time to resolve and I was shocked by the false assurances I received. I finally got out to bed to explore and realised then that the entire floor above had been ripped out.  Shame on you Taj!!!
"I've just staid in Mumbai for 2 nights at the taj mahal palace wing and I have to say that the hotel is very very good as far as service and accomodation is concerned. Being in the old wing is a very nice esperience and I would go back again for sure. The only minus is the size of the rooms: very small for the hotel standards, but the bathroom is very nice and also very clean as the rest of the hotel. You can even check in and out in your room and the staff is very helpful and terribly kind and the service is first quality and also prompt. There are also some very nice brand-name shops. I've been tothe Oberoi few years ago, but this is much better, or at least the old wing is."
"I have to admit I have never stayed at any other hotel in Bombay, I have been to many, but to me the Taj is my home.  I can not say how nice it is to see the same staff year after year. Even a short stay brings a warm greeting and chat to catch up over the lost time. The staff are like friends, and will always go out of their way for you No request too small, everything is handled immediately, service impeccable and discretion always maintained. Some of the finest restaurants are there, and the best shoes in Bombay from Joy. The Taj is the place to be, and walking the halls and grand staircase feels just like home. The lounge is lovely, though small and breakfast can be disappointing, but the staff is very nice. Do take a chai and a chilli chicken pizza with fresh chillies (my"
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal in Colaba for two nights during September.  My room was in the Towers.  If I ever go back again I will only stay in the Palace.  The Towers is really second-grade.  For example, the very tiny balcony and its railings and mosquito grid seriously need a clean.  And notice how the Taj Mahal Mumbai conveniently crops the Towers out of much of its publicity material.  Because it's truly an ugly building!  Some positives:  1.  Being in the centre of things - right at Gateway of India and in the middle of Colaba.  2.  Wasabi restaurant's sushi.  Expensive but truly sublime.  3.  After I checked out at around 06h30 to catch an early train to Goa, I discovered that my train had been delayed by three hours.  I called the hotel from the taxi back from the train"
"This is your best bet in Mumbai. I would give it a 90/100. Beautiful hotel, service very good but there were a few ""bad apples"" don't let that deter you- it still warrants 5 stars. Be sure to get a room facing the sea, that is well worth it. "
"This is a very good hotel.   The room was comfortable, the staff were very attentive and friendly and the food was excellent. However, watch the prices in some of  the hotel's restaurants (e.g. The Souk) because they can be quite high. (very high for Mumbai). We tended to leave the air-conditioning switched off at night because it made us feel washed out if we left it on over night. "
"My fiancee and I stayed here for a couple of days at the beginning of August (I'm working in India at the moment and she had come over to see me). I had booked a ""Grand Luxury Room"" in the heritage wing (on the advice of friends). A three night package (inc. breakfast every day, one lunch and a spa treatment each) came to a very reasonable INR46,000 inc. taxes (or about GBP600). After a minor wrangle over the phone on the way there (I had specifically requested a sea view room and they weren't able to provide me one), we were greeted on arrival with a big smile, told we had been upgraded to a suite and whisked up to the fifth floor by our butler (who had come to greet us) to check in in the club floor. From there on in we were treated like royalty - champagne and fresh flowers"
"If you are planning to go to Mumbai, the Taj Mahal is definetly the place to stay even for a tourist and not only for businessmen. I booked a room in the Tower but I was mysteriously upgrated to the Palace and I discovered this magnificent place. The Palace is the finest luxury hotel I've ever seen. Our room was perfect, the bathroom unforgettable, the bed great and very big, ??inches big Plasma screen, beautiful lounge area near the window and the big breakfast room is something you can't miss. Staff very fast and kind as they reserved everything we asked them to. The swimming pool and its Colonial-Style bar are beautiful.  A great place to stay, worth every single rupee. If possible try to book a Palace Room. It really makes the difference. "
"The Taj was an incredible experience -- the architecture is amazing and you feel like royalty at the pool.  The service is impeccable -- they do everything they can to make you feel comfortable.  I was at the pool -- and as a blonde Westerner, definitely stood out.  When some random man came up and would not leave me alone, one member of staff noticed that I was uncomfortable and escorted the person out.    The rooms were run down (we stayed in the older wing) and need an update, but it was an experience to stay there.  It was also in a great location -- right by India Gate.  The restaurant served really terrible, overpriced food -- which was interesting because basically every other place we ate in Mumbai -- from really cheap to pricier restaurants -- was great.  I would"
"We stayed at the Taj for a night as a little splurge from our backpacking tour.  The service was great without a doubt.  Everyone was helpful and attentive.  I would recommend going to the Taj Spa (not the salon) for a wonderful spa experience.  I felt like royalty from the time I stepped in.  However, the salon experience is not as good, though a little more inexpensive.  We felt the room to be a bit old looking.  The carpet was ragged, and the bathroom smelled like mothballs.  The room had a really stale smell in there.  I think the only good thing about the room was the view of the gateway of India.    For the restaurant and bar, I felt they were way overpriced for the quality of food and drinks.  I don't mind paying more for quality food, but their food was just average. "
"We booked this hotel for the history and location and thought that as it was part of the Taj Group we would not be disppointed with other aspects of the hotel.  Sadly we were wrong.  I am sure if you stay in the Tower check in is efficient as this area looks as if it is a real hotel.  Check in to the older part of the building however is amateurish to say the least and took us 40 minutes on our first attempt and then we were given the wrong room, a further 30 minutes before this could be sorted and we finally were in our room, with our luggage delivered almost 90 minutes from the time we arrived - very poor first impression.  Generally throughout the hotel the service was poor - this might be a reflection on the hotel or that Mumbai is a very different culture to Rajasthan where"
"The Taj Palace and Tower in Mumbai is a beautiful old hotel, in a relatively good area in Mumbai. The hotel is located right next to the gateway to India, and it seemed safe to wander around in the evening - although the hawkers and beggars did drive us a bit mad!  My overall impression of this hotel was pretty good - for the price though, I would have expected a bit more.  The public areas in particular are good, especially in the palace wing - apart from the bar, which was dismal and cold, and more a 3* hotel than a very expensive (for India) 5* one. The pool area is extremely nice and well kept. You can also sit out here for drinks / dinner which is very pleasant. Service in the hotel is sometimes very slow, but generally the staff are polite and helpful.  Our room (in the"
"Incredible location right on the bay, incredible view from the balcony of our suite. Food was so terrible it was actually funny (shrimp cocktail with mayonnaise??). Loved the location - great for just walking out and around. "
"We stayed at the taj in early february. Our room in the Taj Towers, 7th floor was idea for our 4 day stay. Plenty of room to laze around at the end of the day before we ventured out for dinner. We enjoyed breakfast each moring around the pool area verandahs. The service was fantastic by all the staff. We didn't have to move from our chairs as the staff brought our breakfast to us. We also had breakfast in the restaurant overlooking the gateway to India but it was not as relaxing as aroud the pool area. You must try the Indian restaurant in the hotel. The best Indian style meal we have experienced. The lamb and seafood was delicious. The service while a bit muddled at the start it turned out to be surprisingly good. The range of wine offered was good but expensive, so we settled"
"The Taj is the most beautiful, sparkling hotel that we have visited in India.  The staff was amazing, from the greeting with champagne flutes of fresh juice and our free upgrade to the driver that took us to the airport all was perfect.   The view to the ceiling from the palace stairway is worth the price alone. The only place to stay in Mumbai! "
"There are newer, more modern hotels springing up in Mumbai every year, and yet this one remains king.  It has gotten quite expensive, but its charm remains parallel to none.  The Taj looks out on The Gateway of India and the Arabian Sea, speckled with little boats and emblazoned with fiery sunsets each evening.  The rooms are spacious, especially in the older Taj Palace wing, and the service is great.  The pool and surrounding courtyard is tropical and filled with foreigners reading books and ordering teas at all hours.  And, the infamous Sea Lounge remains a lunch favorite where one can sit by the window and look onto The Gateway of India while hearing in the backdrop businessmen from all over the world chatting about hurdle rates and term sheets.  Addtionally, downstairs,"
After reading the variety of reviews we were uncertain whether to book the Taj or the Intercontinental - when we passed the Intercontinental en route to the Taj Mahal we were glad we had chosen the Taj!!  As wow was it impressive when we arrived at just gone midnight - it is worth the expensive rate for a wonderful start to the hotel - the hotel reception and greeting were absolutely first rate - we were only staying one night before a cruise and booked a sea view room in the palace itself - the reviews are right in the sense that the main hotel is much much more impressive than the tower block next door - we were blown away with it on arrival and well used to staying in 5 star hotels so not easily won over!  The rate of the room was dear but no dearer than the intercontinental 
"We were promptly checked into our Heritage wing Luxury sea-view room by polite staff members.We received recently renovated rooms that were large ,modern and beautifully restored.The bathroom was large with shower and bath.There was plenty of bottled water provided daily. Unfortunatetly there was a peculiar odor in the room that seemed to come in from the vents.Was it fresh paint?Some sort of solvent from the new construction?Was it exhaust fumes?Nobody knew.We were told it was a ""new room smell"".We had two rooms on the second floor and both had this odor.We got used to it but it would def be bothersome to some people esp with allergies.Hotel was booked so we could not switch rooms that day. Pool was beautiful and relaxing.Souk rooftop restuarant was tastefully decorated and had"
"We have stayed here 3 days and we must say that this is still a great hotel. The Old lady is still the old lady and has a special ambience especially near the pool. The location in front off the india gate is superb. The service , food and rooms are great. There maybe better hotels in Mumbai but by location in this part off the city this hotel is the very best. We slept in the newly renovated tower rooms with sea view which was really beautifull. Overall this hotel is still great and has something magical but again there are better hotels in the city. Would definately recommend this hotel to everyone."
"Liked this hotel a lot - excellent service, everything you would expect in the room - spacious, beautifully decorated with hot pink colours.  We were in the Tower which is modern, but the more colonial old hotels we stayed in later in the trip had downsides like smaller room sizes, no double glazing and much traffic noise, so the modernness of the Tower wing was a bonus in avoiding issues such as those.   The pool area was lovely and there were several restaurants and a bar with sports TV (partner liked that!)  Well located in the heart of Old Mumbai - easy to get to the main tourist areas.  Expensive, but worth it. "
"Beautiful Hotel in Colaba, close to the Gateway of India. Rooms in the Tower are nothing special (ordinary modern 4/5-star rooms): choose one with a sea view, because it is worth the little price difference and the rear is terrible. If you want nice and classic rooms, choose a Palace Wing room (more expensive). Nice pool. Wi-fi internet for 125INR (30 mins), 200 INR (1 hr), 600 INR (24 hrs). Transportation to the Hotel from Mumbai Int'l Aiport: if can't help having a nice car from the Hotel, they charge around 3000 INR (50 EUR); otherwise, you can catch a prepaid taxi (from on of the booths right out the arrival hall) for 360 INR (7 Eur) or call ahead a Coolcabs taxi (better and a/c cars. though a little more expensive around 11 Eur). For breakfast, avoid hotel restaurant and"
"The Taj by the Gateway to India is a classic old hotel with much history but is overpriced and in need of updating in its rooms.  The recent spate of new upscale hotels coming to Mumbai have left the old Taj in the dust.  We were treated upon our arrival to the ""trick"" mentioned in previous posts.  That is...we arrive at midnight and our room was not ready.  Why?  By double booking rooms for international travelers, the hotel makes the room fee twice.  It is a quirk of international flight schedules that travelers have to pay for a full night's room when they don't stay the entire night.  After being told ""15 more minutes"" two times, and an hour later, we got our rooms.  The apology?  A bottle of cheap red wine and form letter from the management.  Yes, a form letter, that"
"We had read and heard a lot about this hotel in advance, and arriving at 11pm on a Saturday night after a long trek from Varanasi via Delhi, it did not disappoint.  From the moment you arrive you feel its heady cocktail of stately imperial grandeur with the sheen and excitement of modern Mumbai glamour.   It's large and sprawling and in just the short walk up to your room you can feel that it's happening: in the many lounges, bars, ballrooms and restaurants, there's a definite buzz. Bollywood starlets, wannabe's and hangers-on, slick, important-feeling businesspeople and the usual die-hard patrons of an expat oasis - they're all here on cue.    Although there was a slight mix-up with our booking, they worked to ensure we got the rooms we requested - in the old Palace wing rather"
"Although the hotel is well-located, the rooms given when booked on Expedia (over 350USD!) are tiny and not up to 5 star standard at all! We were 2 friends traveling together and the room was obviously not meant for 2 people. The wardrobe was tiny, the bathroom old, in short, not 5 star at all. The grounds are beautiful and the gym was very good though (24 hours) Staff are friendly but everything is overpriced (70USD for airport transfer. One way! If you have too much luggage, they'll suggest a bigger car. At an extra cost!) A disappointment and a bit of a rip off. Stay at the Oberoi instead "
"The Taj Mahal Hotel has an unbelievable ambience and location. Walking into the reception is like walking back in time, when the British Raj and Maharajas and Maharanis came to visit. The view of Gateway to India is spectacular. The service was friendly and helpful. My room was clean and beautiful. I loved the hotel amenities so much, that I stocked up for my trip back home. The rooms in the tower are much newer and fresher. I also needed their Business Centre a lot and found the staff  very helpful. The Pool side lounge, while quiet for most people's taste, was a welcome respite from the hussle and bustle of Mumbai. While an expensive property (as many hotels in India can be), I definitely want to go back.  Hotel cars are definitely much nicer than the average ""cool"" cab or"
"It is quite overwhelming at first because of the grand entrance with  an amazing lobby always busy, You get to see the cream of mumbai society at their best. The porters are always greeting you and opening the doors for you. breakfast at he t Shamiana  restaurant was great. they had  a different menu everyday. The location of the hotel is very good, as you can walk yo the colaba area where you can get bargains galore. I bought lovely silk and chiffon scarves  and purses and handbags for a very good price. We had a seaview room which was nice because we could see the India Gate from the room and just watch all the people who take fotos,take the ferryyboat,etc. "
"Loved the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower. We stayed in the new tower with a city view and loved it. The hotel is huge and very business like. It like a swanky Las Vegas hotel but nicer. Due to the size you loose the personal Taj touch. Everyone is hurried and don't expect much......but the location is amazing. Overall, we loved it and do recommend it."
"Early Dec 2006. We found the Taj Palace to be a truly special place. The staff were exceptionally pleasant (particularly the charming young people who opened the doors and pressed the elevator buttons) and the hotel was an oasis of calm in the city.    We booked onine for a ""weekend special"" (even though we were there Thursday through Monday) which included breakfast for the same price as a room without breakfast. The fifth floor breakfast room also includes tea in the afternoon and drinks in the evening. The small buffet  has Indian and Western items, and to-order eggs are available. We didn't need to go elsewhere for lunch most days. The service in the breakfast room was charming--much better than in the paying restaurants in the Taj. I never took money to breakfast and still"
"I wasn't going to send in a review of this hotel but after reading the review of Jan. 4, I decided I should write and voice my findings during my three night stay over Christmas. I reserved a very expensive Grand Luxury Suite.  The suite I got was old, tired and run down.  Even the coil in my mattress was broken and stuck through!   The service was not up to par for a hotel of this caliber and especially for a suite category of this level.  There was practically no personal attention.  Room service for breakfast was consistenly 15-25 minutes over the 30 minutes they said when placing the order on the phone.  Little annoyances continued throughout my stay which put a sour taste in our mouths. The hotel has great history and location.  Unfortunately, it seems that management needs"
"I was very disappointed with our stay. Of all the hotels we stayed at in India over 3 weeks, the service at this Taj was clearly the worst.  When we arrived at the hotel, it took nearly an hour to check in because the hotel didn't accommodate our request for 2 adjacent rooms - and claimed not to have 2 rooms on the same floor until I had to yell at the manager. I was traveling with my family - including my 5 year old and 7 year old, so being on 2 different floor wasn't an option. Although I was patient for the first 45 minutes, suddenly after I got angry, 2 adjacent rooms came available - the manager claimed 2 people just checked out at 9:30 at night. Of course, when we got to the rooms, 5 minutes later, they were already clean and ready to go, with no sign that anyone had been"
"The setting is beautiful just behind the Gateway to India lookingout over the bay.  It is spoilt a little by the deprivation that is close by that is typical of India.  The service was very good, the staff soon learning to recognize you and call you by name.  Having sampled all the restaurants, the service and food were very good in all, however our favourite was the Souk up at teh top of the Tower, the best food was probably The Grill but also the most expensive.  The pool and the gym were very pleasant places to  relax followed by a drink on the terrace.  We shall certainly stay there again if we go back.  It is one of the more expensive hotels in Mumbai, but well worth it for a first time visit. "
"The whole experience of staying at the Taj is incredible, the hotel is part of Mumbia’s history and you really feel this when your inside the hotel. The service is fantastic, the restaurants very good (although also very expensive!) and the whole atmosphere of the hotel is special. My favourite part of the hotel is pool & fitness area- unusually for a hotel this a straight, large pool (33m I think) so you can actually do some real swimming, it is relatively busy which gives a nice holiday feeling rather than feeling like a cold business hotel. The fitness centre has the latest new equipment with individual TV screens for each machine and again it is actually used by people so there is atmosphere which is nice change for a hotel gym. I can imagine that the Taj is the kind of"
"Huge, beautiful hotel right by the gateway to India. Rooms weren't exactly to a 5* standard as they were a little dated and worn around the edges. The complex itself is impressive with lots to see and do. There's a shopping avenue inside the hotel and some lovely pool areas for relaxing. The breakfast is plentiful and over the top. I did feel a little guilty seeing all of that food infront of me while there was so much poverty beyond the walls. "
"The Taj bills itself as one of the finest hotels in India with some of the best rooms in India.  This is simply not correct. In fact we were disappointed with a very poor room - one of the more expensive in the original wing (2nd floor).  Even when we complained about the small damp room, we were moved to a bigger room on the club fllor (5th), which was also a disappointment.   All in all, the rooms are tired and dated.  For a really luxury Indian city hotel try the Imperial in Delhi which for a similar price has phenomenal rooms. Service was no more than adequate in the hotel.  On checking in, our receptionist insisted on stopping every two minutes to answer the phone and kept us waiting for a long time.  The very fancy TV kept breaking also. The undoubted high point of the"
"Sorry to have to give a very negative review, but we had a pretty bad experience here. It was our last night after a fantastic holiday, and we wanted to treat ourselves by staying at the Taj.   The woman on reception was indifferent bordering on rude, and had to take lots of phone calls so check in took a very long time. We were booked into a premiere sea facing room in the heritage wing - the room we were first shown to stank of damp, was tiny and very dated. They changed the room, but it still simply was not worth the money - very tired decor (they are renovating, so the updated rooms are bound to be better). The TV didn't work, even after someone came to try and fix it. Breakfast in the Sea Lounge was indifferent, and definitely not 5 star standard.   On a more positive note,"
"This is a beautiful hotel in an ideal location that really lives up to the reputation of Taj hotels.   The gateway of India is immediatley opposite and there are plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance.  One really handy pointer when getting taxis in Mumbai is to always use the meter, insist on it if the taxi drivers say it isn't working. All taxi drivers then have a chart (usually under the dash board) where they can work out the price relating to what number the meter is on. This is particularly useful outside hotels like the Taj where there is obviuosly more of a tendancy for drivers to try and rip off the tourists!   The pool area is an oasis great for relaxing and escaping the chaos of Mumbai! The service in this hotel is excellent and nothing is too much"
"Have stayed at this hotel a few times in the past couple of years. First thing to say is the tower wing of the hotel is an overpriced routine hotel with no character. The palace wing is another matter - full of character and beautifully appointed. There are a few different rooms available. The ""basic"" rooms in the palace wing are known as the luxury grand rooms and are on the first couple of floors of the hotel. They have been reasonable recently re-decorated and, whilst not being huge by any standards, are finished beautifully with silk curtains and lovely wooden furniture. The bathroom is wonderful - no other word for it really - spacious with a great bath and amazing shower. Bed is comfortable and the view from the window of the Gateway is lovely. There are also the rooms in"
"The hotel has a great location for Mumbai. The Gateway to India is at the front, overlooking the ocean.   Rooms will all depend on what you book, and at what price. There are super rooms with sea view, others that do not have the view, some in the Towers (a 1980's?) extension, looks like a tower block and do not have the charm of the original building, but these rooms are generally cheaper. My room had a good sea view and was in the new tower block. It was clean, comfortable and well equipped. A nice bed, I slept well.   My breakfast and service were good. Plenty of choice, well cooked and prepared, attentive staff. My visit to the Indian Restaurant was pleasant enough, not exceptional, but good.   Lots of attentive staff everwhere, as you expect in India. I found all of them"
"From private check-in at 5 a.m. to the exquisite room (with a bathroom facility unlike any other), it was as fine as could be.  The small breakfast nook overlooked the Gateway to India and a never-ending movement of boats and people.  The furnishings, including the huge bed, perfectly fitted an up-dated turn-of-the-century hotel--itself among the tourist destinations.  The restaurants were the best we experienced in India.  And the pool, which almost never had anyone in it, was a delight, as was the exercise facility.  All in all, as good as it gets.    If you have the chance, check out the fish market pier--an amazing sight.  But don't wear fancy shoes. "
"This hotel is absolutely amazing! It's well worth staying as the rooms are fab and nothing like what you'd expect from india... However, we ate in the Souk restaurant (which was v expensive) and I got a horrible bug that required antibiotics to clear up and wasn't very pleasant at all.   I'd def recommend a visit, but def not recommend eating there if you don't want to get sick! "
"I've stayed here on four occasions over the past couple of years and I'd love to be able to write a totally positive review - it's location is great, the building is magical, the staff generally very good.  I've always stayed in the Palace wing and, as far as I'm concerned, even the rooms I've had without the sea view are gorgeous.  Really comfortable and such fabulous ambience.   Walking around the hotel is a delight - truly magical building.  I also love the pool area - a peaceful haven form the madness of Mumbai. it's a wonderful to lie there and look up at the beautiful old building with the endless sounds of  Mumbai in the background.    My big criticism though is the F&B and I absolutely agree with previous reviewers about this.  Breakfast in the Sea Lounge (amazing decor"
"I recently had very bad experience staying at this prestigious property of Taj Group. I was booked into a Club Room at Taj Mahal Palace in the Palace Wing. This hotel has a lot of history attached to it and shown in one of the channels in every Taj Luxury properties across India. But unfortunately the management must have been basking in the glory of its huge name, unparallel location and history. Because right from the time I entered I found myself suddenly landed in a 'bazaar' atmosphere where all kinds of people were moving and jostling around the way they do in a shopping mall. As I did not take the courtesy transfer from airport to hotel, there was none at the main reception who would guide me to the 5th floor club reception in the palace wing. When I complained about it at"
"This was a nice hotel stay over the weekend in Mumbai to have convenient access (walk across the street) to the Gateway to India and the boats to Elephanta Island.  There is also a Cottage Industries Emporium one block north for fixed-price shopping by foreigners.  Note for those that want nice deals on shopping and enjoy the sport of negotiating, when you go to Elephanta Island, there is a market along both sides of the steps, so on your way down, engage your bargaining.  If you don't like the price, keep walking because you'll see the item six times more before you get to the dock and the vendor will likely chase you down offering a better price.  The hotel is very nice, good service, and clean rooms.  Note that there are two parts to the hotel, the Heritage side which is the"
"We stayed here at the tail end of our 17-day trip to India, and it was the *perfect* way to end our stay.  We actually arrived in Mumbai 3 nights before our reservation, en route to Goa (where we stayed before Mumbai) as we had arranged for the hotel to hold on to much of our luggage while we were in Goa.  They were extremely helpful, and when we returned 4 days later everything was where it was supposed to be.  We arrived in Mumbai on a train from Goa at 5 in the morning, and our driver (sent from the hotel) was right there on the platform.  He was very friendly and ushered us into a Range Rover, and took us to the hotel.  Check in was fast and seamless, and soon we were on our way to our beautiful heritage wing room.    We had one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept"
"Absolutely faultless. I was a little concerned it would be too ""posh"", but it was fab. Terrific restaraunts, (though we only had time to try 2 of them), and very reasonably priced. The room was great, I was delighted to have fresh flowers delivered! The pool is fab, and the pool beds the comfiest ever!! Desperate to go back to India, and tacking on 3 nights in Mumbai just to stay here again. "
"We arrived on February 14, 2006 - who knew that valentines day was celebrated to this magnitude!  We couldn't get a dinner reservation in any hotel!   We stayed in the Tower for a price over $400 USD.  The rooms were clean, spatious and had a great view of the Gateway of India.  The mattresses and pillows provided the best comfort when sleeping compared to other places during our 6 week journey throughout India.   Although I've never lived in India but my origins are from North Indian I was impressed by the services, cleanliness and amenities available.  We were given a room to wait in as our rooms weren't ready but were able to settle in within the hour.  The doormen were great in directing us to great restaurants as the hotel restaurants were all completely booked.   At night"
"We have just returned from a 5 day trip to the Taj and we can only have praise for everything about our stay. The staff were exceptionally attentive and pleasant and we felt that they couldn't do enough for us, when we requested a pack of cards someone rushed out of the hotel to purchase them for us, and they were delivered to us at the poolside. We had an updated room overlooking the Gateway to India in the Palace which was beautiful and clean with a choice of silk or towelling bathrobes, lovely Molten Brown products and fresh fruit everyday. The spa was a delight, the food excellent and we cannot wait to return. Next time we will take our 9 and 10 year old children to experience this beautiful hotel. We cannot fault it. "
"The Taj is just  as it's been since the 'Eighties (and probably before) -- one  of the  best hotels in the world.   The  marvelous beds beat  a  trip to Lourdes for rejuvenation  of lumbar afflictions.  The women at the desks are suspiciously  beautiful (are there no class-action equal-opportunity lawsuits in India?)  Our room, like  those  of other contributors, looked  out over  the Gate  of India, but, although youcould spend  hours in the window watching the hustle and bustle  of India, it was not at  all noisy.  I  suppose  this means one  should ask for a high floor with harbor  view. "
"I stayed in the Tower section during my stay; I had a room with the view out to India gate and the ocean, what an amazing sight.  Because it is right at the India Gate, it is unbelievably noisy even though I was all the way up on the 14th floor.  It is indeed a city doesn't go to sleep, and neither do you!  I was even awaken at 6am one Sunday morning by the chanting and Indian classical music because of a religious ceremony.  If this doesn't bother you, the room is average and comfortable.  The restaurants are nice but quite pricey.  The grounds is beautiful, and you must visit the Palace section of the hotel - I am sure you will be impressed by the opulance and elegance of this historical architecture.  It's a place you should stay at least once!"
"We stayed at the Taj for 1 week in February and I have to say it was a fantastic experience. I booked a $175 Tower room but was upgraded on arrival to a room in the Heritage wing. The room was fabulous very clean and every amenity you would expect in a 5 star hotel. The service was fantastic and we ate all our meals in the hotel. There are 6 restaurants and we had meals in all of them - Japanese, Chinese, Indian Middle Eastern - all very different and the food was excellent. We had lunch in the area around the pool and this varied from a sandwich to a steak. The wine is very pricey compared to other drinks but we found the Chilean chardonnay by the glass the best value. We found the staff to be very polite, efficient and helpful and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. "
"I decided to stay at the Taj heritage wing for 2 nights which was US$425 (without taxes) per night expensive yes but I thought it would be worth it. Most flights to Mumbai arrive at ridiculous times in the early morning. We requested an early check-in. We checked into the room at 5am which we thought was really good service. When we got to the room we realised that it was not the room we had booked and the room had not been cleaned properly. After complaining we moved to another room with was slightly bigger and had a great view of the Gateway to India. However, we were told that this room was not the room we booked and was US$50 more but they would not charge the extra. This room was really nothing special (apart from the view), the furniture just looked tatty even though it"
"Date: 02 February 2006 13:04 We stayed in the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai for 4 nights, have requested a seaview room since day one. On the second day, the front desk told us that we can be moved that night. We waited until 1am, there's no news from front desk. They only appologize again when we called. I went to have my breakfast at the sealounge on the third day morning. The buffet is nothing special after trying most of the five star hotels, eg. Marriot, grand hyatt etc., I got food poisoning within 2 hours after I had the bacon and beans from the buffet. After I checked with my friends who had had dinner with me the night before at Olive restaurant, they were all ok. The food poisoning was from your buffet, I remember that I told my wife the food does not taste right as"
"I stayed at the Taj Mahal Towers for one night.  In hindsight, for this price (£175), the service compared to a five star hotel in the UK, is no comparison.    On arrival, we were delegated a stuffy, dusty room with a nasty view.  My hayfever allergy began as soon as we entered, and I could not bare spending even 5 minutes in this room so I asked for a change.  The manager apologised and then took 1 and a half hours to delegate another room. This did have a great view of the Gateway to India and was larger and cleaner.   The service at the Taj Palace on the whole is despicable.  The employees are rude and arrogant, and there is a huge delay for any request.  We ate dinner at the SOUK.  I will admit the food is fantastic but it them half an hour to prepare a table when the"
I have never encountered such service!  I was traveling on business and did not choose the hotel.  Chances are - I would have stayed elsewhere because it is quite expensive.  But in all honesty - worth every penny - or shall I say ruppe!    Room service is amazing - you must try the pizza (how is that from a native New Yorker?) The Golden Dragon restaurant was quite good - though very pricey.  I recommend going to Indigo just a couple of blocks away (the Clintons ate there as well!)  I stayed in the heritage hall - and I loved the room.  However - the hallways were always warm.  I am not sure how comfortable that would be in July.  If you are going to Mumbai - and can afford the steep prices - this is a MUST! 
"I was orig. confused when doing research, since there are several Taj's, hence the title.   We stayed in a 'palace' room facing the water and monument. It's made up of the central stairway and two wings. Try to get the wing near the monument.  Our friends had a better view of the gateway monument, and also a little dining alcove.  Their room was definitely larger than ours, yet I think our room was $400 and theirs was $3xx.   You check-in off to the side, and it truly is different.  There is a room set up like a large living room, with 2 desks at one end. Nothing like the counter at most large hotels.  The Tower side has the routine set-up, but the palace side was definitely nicer.  I was sitting in the living room area once, just waiting for someone and was offered tea, water,"
"in general the service was great, the staff seems at times unaware of what's going on (what's open what's closed and the times) But the rooms were great, very clean, and room service was timely. If I went back I'd stay there again, now that I know what time the health club opens and the restaurants open."
"Palace - Truly a great hotel of the world. Huge proportions - massive halls, staircase, rooms. A reminder of by-gone era but here you can still live it and be treated to true luxury. Few hotels as impressive from an architectural point of view. Service was excellent, staff were extremely friendly and professional; nothing was an issue or problem ...what a relief to find an hotel where guests are still treated as guests. Food was good although the Masala Restuarant needs to improve by returning to true Indian food and not something sanatized for visitors. Definitely do not stay in the Tower - not because its bad but because it would be your loss not to enjoy the Heritage wing, the Palace. Request a sea facing room for a great view of the Gateway to India. If you are trying to"
"We stayed in both the Heritage Wing and the Tower and would recommend the former.  The tower is boring and uninspiring while the Heritage Wing (also called the ""palace"") retains a good feel for its history while being modern and well-appointed.  The widescreen tv with on-demand video and in-room internet access was very convenient.  The restaurants were all very good, particularly Souk, the new middle eastern restaurant that has replaced the penthouse Apollo Bar, and Golden Dragon, which is obviously a power broker spot for Mumbai heavyweights (both political and corporeal!).  No complaints about paint fumes here.  I guess they finished the remodeling.  The pool deserves special mention, as it is a nice spot to relax and the sun is very inviting.  This hotel also has the best"
"We were in Mumbai for a few days and stayed at Taj, in the Tower part of the hotel. Everything was great. I would recommend higher floors with water view - you would not regret, promise!!! "
"We stayed at the Taj Mahal for 4 nights.  When we arrived, we were given a deluxe room.  We walked in the room and were dissapointed!  The smell was bad, the carpet was dirty and the bathrooms were not very clean.  We were gone all day and when we came back that night to sleep, we could hardly sleep  because of the noise from the streets.  The next day we demanded another room and were moved to the higher floors of the New wing.  These rooms were much better!! It was like we were in a different hotel.  Nicely decorated, clean and very very quite!   We would definately recommend spending the extra money to stay on the higher floors of the new wing.  The middle eastern resturant Souk on the 20th floor is worth the dining experience.  The food was wonderful and the ambience is even"
"I have stayed both in the heritage wing and the new tower and the heritage wing is in a class of its own. The bathroom we had was out of this world, the room was massive and even the check in desk was upper class. However this year we stayed in the new wing and the carpets were shabby, the bathroom wasn't as nice as ours at home, and we have a very humble house, and if it were not for the lovely pool and smashing pool boys,  we wouldn't return as we can't afford the heritage wing.  We booked into the heritage for our honeymoon and were given single beds by the discourteous receptionist, who I understand has since been fired.  All in all it is a lovely hotel, but they really need to give the tower an overhaul. The breakfasts however are amazing, more like brunch !"
I have stayed at the Taj several times while visiting Bombay. It has a wonderful location (right next to the Gateway of India) and on the waterfront. The problem is that over the past 2 years this hotel has jacked up their prices by almost 300% making it a very poor value when compared to the other hotels that have sprung up in the city.  This hotel (like most of the 5 star hotels in Bombay) follows a two-tier pricing policy. One for foreign nationals and the other for Indian citizens - prices for foreign nationals are about 50 to 100% higher and are priced in dollars (usually). Try to get the Indian citizen rate if possible (by booking through a travel agent or your company).  While the service provided is good - almost everything that the Taj has to offer is over-priced (and
"We had a double deluxe room with a water view in the Tower for a total of 3 nights; one night at the beginning of our 2 week trip and two nights at the end. Unfortunately we had expectations that were not met. If you are expecting anything more than a business travelers hotel, don't stay here. The first ""deluxe"" room they showed us, that they claimed had been remodeled, was dingy, the couch was small and stained and there we large paint cracks in the walls. Also there was an odor to the room that we did not like. The second room they showed us was brighter, had a larger bed and smelled better, even though this was a smoking room and the first room was not. By the way, when I told them that we were on our honeymoon and could they offer us a more romantic room (even for an extra"
